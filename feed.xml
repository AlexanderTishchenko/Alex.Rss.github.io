<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The broader indexes lost some recent momentum on Thursday after Walmart&rsquo;s WMT</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;cautious outlook spurred investors to reassess President Trump&rsquo;s tariffs, among other policy changes.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Two stocks that dipped in today&rsquo;s trading session and may catch investors&#39; attention are Palantir Technologies PLTR&nbsp;and Vertiv Holdings VRT. They are certainly going to draw interest as buy-the-dip candidates, with Palantir shares soaring over +1,100% in the last two years and Vertiv stock up over +500%.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/10/94652.jpg?v=608456035" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>PLTR Pulls Back as Trump Cuts Defense Spending</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Falling 5% on Thursday to $106 a share, the drop in Palantir&rsquo;s stock has been preceded by last week&rsquo;s announcement that the Trump administration will cut defense spending and has urged Russia and China to do so as well.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Palantir&rsquo;s software platforms are used by intelligence communities, with its largest customer being the U.S. government. Although Palantir&rsquo;s offerings are known for assisting with counterterrorism investigations and operations, the company&rsquo;s acceleration in machine learning and other artificial intelligence applications has started to broaden its customer base.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This has led to much optimism, with Palantir recently exceeding its Q4 expectations earlier in the month. For now, the trend of earnings estimate revisions has remained compelling for Palantir, with fiscal 2025 and FY26 EPS estimates up 12% and 18% in the last 30 days, respectively.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/44/94653.jpg?v=1671656317" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Expecting high double-digit top and bottom line growth for the foreseeable future, Palantir currently checks a &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;A&rdquo; Zacks Style Scores grade for&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Growth&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">and</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Momentum. Still, Palantir will need to &quot;grow&quot; into its lofty valuation with an &ldquo;F&rdquo; Value Score.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Going public in 2020, Palantir has broken the&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">profitability&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">line, and rapid sales growth has been an indicator of its future earnings potential. Palantir brought in $2.87 billion last year, with FY25 sales expected to expand 31% to $3.76 billion.</span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a7/94655.jpg?v=1157333625" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Vertiv&rsquo;s Pullback </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">With no direct connection to Trump&rsquo;s policy implementations, Vertiv&rsquo;s stock fell 3% in today&rsquo;s broader selloff to $104. Like Palantir, Vertiv went public in 2020 and checks the box for growth investors as a provider of digital infrastructure and continuity solutions, including hardware, software, and analytic services.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Vertiv surpassed Q4 expectations earlier in the month as well, and total sales are expected to increase 15% in FY25 and FY26, with projections edging toward $10 billion. Even better, Vertiv is profitable, reporting net income of $495.8 million in 2024, with EPS growth of over 20% expected in FY25 and FY26.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ca/94656.jpg?v=976691597" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">VRT checks a &ldquo;D&rdquo; Zacks Style Scores grade for Value but is at a fairly reasonable 30.1X forward earnings multiple. This is near its Zacks Computers-IT Services Industry average but above the benchmark S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 23.2X. In regards to Growth and Momentum, VRT has an&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">&ldquo;A&rdquo;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">&ldquo;C&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Style Scores grade, respectively.</span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/05/94657.jpg?v=349428256" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Keeping their Value Scores in mind, Palantir and Vertiv stock may be better suited for investors who are ok with taking on risk for the potential of high rewards. That said, PLTR and VRT&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">do appear to be ideal targets to buy on the dip as</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;two of the market&rsquo;s top performers in recent years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2419052/buy-the-dip-in-palantir-technologies-pltr-or-vertiv-holdings-vrt-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-investment_ideas-2419052">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Thursday, February 20, 2025</strong><br /><br />Market indexes started out in a cranky mood this morning after cautious guidance from <strong>Walmart </strong>WMT regarding potential tariff hits to its imports in the coming quarters. It provided a good excuse for the market rally to take a breather and book some profits as the final leg of Q4 earnings season proceeds.<br /><br />We finished off session lows, but the Dow lost -450 points on the day, -1.01%, while the S&amp;P 500 came in -26 points, -0.43% &mdash; breaking its two-day streak of all-time closing highs. Nasdaq dropped -93 points, -0.47%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 slid -20, -0.91%. The Dow and the Russell are now in the red over the past five trading days.<br /><br /><h2>January LEI Dips Lower than Expected<br /></h2><br /><strong>U.S. Leading Economic Indicators (LEI)</strong> from the Conference Board for January came in at -0.3% earlier today, slightly below the -0.2% anticipated and the +0.1% reported for December. LEI numbers over the trailing six months is now -0.9%, which is still better than the -1.7% from the prior six months.<br /><br />As its title would indicate, Leading Economic Indicators is a gauge of business confidence for the near term. But while LEI has been on a downturn over the past year, its Coincident Economic Indicators (CEI) &mdash; a print of the current state of the economy &mdash; remains on an upward trajectory after a steep drop during the Covid pandemic.<br /><br /><h2>After-Market Earnings Roundup: BKNG, DBX, RIVN<br /></h2><br />Online travel giant<strong> Booking.com</strong> BKNG outperformed expectations in its Q4 report released this afternoon, with earnings of $41.55 per share easily surpassing the $235.64 analysts were looking for. Revenues similarly made easy work of outpacing estimates to $5.5 billion in the quarter. Gross Bookings performed better than expectations, +17% from the year-ago quarter. Shares had been up strongly on the news, but have now come back down to closing-bell levels. The stock is up +35% over the past year.<br /><br /><strong>Check out the updated Zacks Earnings Calendar here.</strong><br /><br />Cloud-based content-sharing service <strong>Dropbox</strong> DBX also came out with Q4 figures after the bell, with earnings of 73 cents per share zipping past the 62 cents in the Zacks consensus. Revenues of $644 million neatly outperformed the $638.5 million projected. This company has not missed a quarterly earnings estimate in its entire publicly traded history. Slowing customer growth has put a drag on shares in late trading, down -5% at this hour.<br /><br />EV competitor <strong>Rivian</strong> RIVN posted a better-than-expected loss per share in its Q4 report in late trading, with -46 cents per share a nice improvement from the -66 cents analysts had been expecting (and much improved from the -$1.36 per share reported a year ago). Revenues of $1.73 billion also nicely improved over the estimated $1.43 billion. Gross profit reached $170 million in the quarter, and shares are +5% in the after-market.<br /><br />Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

The Zacks analyst believes that the company is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators (XPUs). Broadcom&rsquo;s expanding AI portfolio, along with a rich partner base, reflects solid top-line growth potential.</span></div></div><p><span style="font-size:16px;">However, a challenging macroeconomic environment and high debt level are major concerns.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">(You can&nbsp;read the full research report on Broadcom here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Thermo Fisher&rsquo;</strong>s shares have underperformed the Zacks Medical &ndash; Instruments&nbsp;industry over the past year (-4.0% vs. +4.8%). The Zacks analyst believes that volatile macroeconomic uncertainties can dent Thermo Fisher&rsquo;s operations. The continuous decline in COVID testing-related demand also adds to the worry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">Yet, the company is braving the ongoing tough economic conditions by utilizing the PPI Business System. Several recent product launches, including a Thermo Scientific Iliad scanning transmission electron microscope and new additions to the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads platform have aided. Its continuous efforts to prioritize its partnership with customers to drive innovation and improve patient care bode well.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">(You can&nbsp;read the full research report on Thermo Fisher here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">Shares of<strong> Aon</strong> have outperformed the Zacks &nbsp;Insurance &ndash; Brokerage&nbsp;industry over the past six months (+16.8% vs. +8.4%). Per the Zacks analyst, the company&rsquo;s bottom line has been growing due to strategic initiatives and strong fundamentals, which have enhanced its capabilities and made it one of the largest insurance brokers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">However, long-term debt has been continuously increasing since 2014. Growing interest expenses are a concern. Its financial results are sensitive to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">(You can&nbsp;read the full research report on Aon here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Massimos&rsquo;</strong> shares have underperformed the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Products industry over the last six months (-10.1% vs. +33.3%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company faces headwinds, including supply chain disruptions due to its reliance on global suppliers, and rising material costs from inflationary pressures. Reliance on a concentrated customer base poses financial risks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">Yet, new product launches, automation investments, and strategic partnerships have benefited the company. Strategic deals with Tractor Supply and Armlogi enhance retail and operational efficiency. Massimo is also entering the EV sector with eco-friendly UTVs and ATVs, aligning with consumer demand for sustainability.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">(You can&nbsp;read the full research report on Massimo here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Marriott International, Inc.

<![CDATA[ Commodity ETF (USCI) Hits New 52-Week High ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 21:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>United States Commodity ETF </strong>USCI is probably on the radar for investors seeking momentum. The fund just hit a 52-week high and moved up 27.72% from its 52-week low price of $57.07 per share.</p><p>Are more gains in store for this ETF? Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea of where it might be headed.</p><h2><strong>USCI in Focus</strong></h2><p>The underlying SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Total Return seeks to reflect the performance of a portfolio of 14 commodity futures. The product charges 111 bps in annual fees (See: All Broad Commodity ETFs).</p><h2><strong>Why the Move?</strong></h2><p>The commodity sector has been an area to watch lately, given the rise in prices. Cocoa and coffee prices surged significantly in 2024 driven by unfavorable weather conditions and persisting supply concerns. Additionally, gold prices are surging as investors seek safe-haven assets amid the uncertainty related to President Trump&#39;s reciprocal tariffs. Silver is also riding the wave of gold&rsquo;s bull run.</p><h2><strong>More Gains Ahead?</strong></h2><p>USCI might continue its strong performance in the near term, with a positive weighted alpha of 28.38 (per Barchart.com), which gives cues of another rally.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2419042/commodity-etf-usci-hits-new-52-week-high?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2419042">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Is C3.ai Stock the Next Palantir and a Buy? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Software-as-a-service (SaaS) company <strong>Palantir Technologies Inc</strong>.&rsquo;s PLTR shares have soared 388.7% in the past year, a noteworthy comeback after the stock took a beating in its initial public offering.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another SaaS company, <strong>C3.ai, Inc.</strong> AI, providing AI-based applications, has become a Wall Street darling as it continues to get a lot of business from the government. C3.ai&rsquo;s shares have gained 17.5% in the past year, with further potential based on recent accelerated revenue growth increases. Does this mean C3.ai can rival Palantir, and is the stock a buy? Let&rsquo;s delve into it &ndash;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/2a/94551.jpg?v=751579310" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p><p><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Reasons to Be Bullish on PLTR Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Palantir ended last year with revenues of $2.87 billion, up 29% from the prior year. Palantir&rsquo;s top line improved as more customers began to use the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which can automate tasks surpassing human capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AIP&rsquo;s popularity has lured both new and existing customers. The net dollar retention rate in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased, indicating that current customers are spending more on Palantir&rsquo;s products.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With existing customers generating substantial business for Palantir, the company needs to spend less on revenue generation, resulting in strong growth margins. Palantir&rsquo;s adjusted operating income did improve last year.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While Palantir&rsquo;s total contract value shot up in the fourth quarter of 2024, its remaining deal value (RDV) climbed 40% to $5.4 billion from a year ago. Palantir&rsquo;s growth is likely to accelerate this year, with RDV exceeding last year&rsquo;s revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company also anticipates further growth due to increasing demand for AI software to enhance productivity. Analysts expect spending on AI software worldwide to jump fourfold between the current year and 2030, generating billions in annual revenues.</p><h2>Reasons to Be Bullish on AI Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">C3.ai&rsquo;s revenues soared 29% year over year to $94.3 million in the fiscal second quarter as the company&rsquo;s ready-to-use AI programs were appreciated by its current customers. C3.ai generated most of its income from subscriptions, reflecting strength through recurring revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">C3.ai&rsquo;s strategic alliances are also driving business growth. C3.ai is now the most sought-after AI application of <strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s MSFT Azure cloud services. C3.ai also has a tie-up with <strong>Alphabet Inc.</strong> GOOGL-owned Google Cloud, which could help the company scale its business and improve profit margins. Due to these partnerships, C3.ai aims for revenue growth of 22% to 28% for the current year.</p><h2>Could C3.ai be the Next Palantir? Should I Invest in AI Stock Now?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Palantir presently trades at almost 110 times sales, a massive premium. However, Palantir is well-positioned to justify its sky-high valuation as the company expects to beat future estimates, given its steady rise in customer bases, contract increase and RDV jump. Meanwhile, any defense budget cuts under the Trump administration could cause short-term volatility in Palantir stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, despite a solid partner network, C3.ai hasn&rsquo;t been able to report profit. In reality, the company expects an adjusted operating loss of $105 million to $135 million for fiscal 2025. But Palantir already posted a profit last year. Thus, concluding that C3.ai will be the next Palantir is premature.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Risk-tolerant investors, meanwhile, may buy the C3.ai stock based on revenue growth, varied alliances and diversification into new sectors for potential profitability. Risk-averse investors may adopt a wait-and-watch approach.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the moment, C3.ai has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Palantir has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2419036/is-c3-ai-stock-the-next-palantir-and-a-buy?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|investment_ideas-2419036">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Should You Add PSTG Stock to Your Portfolio Pre-Q4 Earnings? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pure Storage, Inc.</strong> PSTG will report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Feb. 26.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 43 cents, indicating a decline of 14% from the year-ago reported quarter. The consensus estimate for total revenues is pegged at $869.9 million, implying 10.1% year-over-year growth.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fc/94558.jpg?v=218440851" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the fiscal fourth quarter, Pure Storage expects revenues to be $867 million, implying an increase of 9.7% from the year-ago level.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PSTG delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 22.16%, on average, beating estimates on each occasion. In the last reported quarter, the company pulled off an earnings surprise of 16.3%.</p><h2>What Our Model Predicts for PSTG&rsquo;s Q4</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PSTG this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PSTG has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><h2>Factors to Focus Ahead of PSTG&rsquo;s Q4 Earnings</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">PSTG&rsquo;s fiscal fourth-quarter performance is likely to have gained from continued sales momentum witnessed for FlashArray//E, Flashblade//E and FlashArray//C solutions, along with robust renewals of Evergreen subscriptions. Increasing uptake of Pure Fusion among enterprise customers is another tailwind.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the last reported quarter, Subscription services revenues (45.3%) of $376.4 million rose 22%, driven mainly by strong renewals of Evergreen subscriptions. We expect Subscription services revenues to be $399.1 million, up 21.3% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also, PSTG deepened its partnership with Kioxia (December 2024), a global leader in NAND Flash technology, to accelerate the development of high-performance, scalable storage solutions amid increasing Flash demand for the hyperscale industry. PSTG&rsquo;s efforts to penetrate the hyperscaler industry with its Purity-based DirectFlash technology bodes well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The quick advances in AI technology are opening up several market opportunities for Pure Storage in various market segments. It has announced several critical new platform features aimed at addressing the evolving needs of enterprise customers amid a rapid proliferation of AI.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Pure Storage, Inc. Stock Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h2> <img alt="Pure Storage, Inc.

Quote</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The launch of Pure Storage GenAI Pod (November 2024) simplifies the deployment of generative AI projects by providing full-stack solutions that reduce the time, cost and expertise required for implementation. It&rsquo;s useful for organizations looking to harness the potential of generative AI without the usual complexities. It also signed a deal with CoreWeave, providing its storage solutions as a standard option within CoreWeave&rsquo;s dedicated cloud environment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Backed by a rise in Evergreen//One opportunities valued at under $5 million and transitioning to traditional sales, management has tweaked its revenue forecast for fiscal 2025. It expects $3.15 billion in revenues, indicating 11.5% growth year over year, outpacing the prior estimate of $3.1 billion with 10.5% growth. However, this dynamic shift has affected Evergreen//One TCV&rsquo;s sales outlook.

It has significantly outpaced the 24.3% growth of its Computer Storage Devices Industry and the S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s gain of 3.6%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/77/94560.jpg?v=637996290" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The increase is also better than some of its notable peers in the same space. <strong>NetApp</strong> NTAP, <strong>Netlist</strong> NLST and <strong>Teradata Corporation</strong> TDC have registered declines of 1.7%, 33.2% and 19.7%, respectively, in the same time frame.</p><h2>PSTG&rsquo;s Investment Considerations</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">PSTG&rsquo;s strategic efforts to gain market share in the hyperscale and AI sector and its subscription-focused model bode well.

<![CDATA[ JOBY's Q4 Earnings Coming Up: Time to Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Joby Aviation </strong>JOBY is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 26, after market close.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2024 loss is currently pegged at 18 cents per share and has remained stable over the past 60 days. Additionally, the consensus mark implies a 5.9% downslide from the year-ago actuals. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2024 revenues is currently pegged at $0.15 million, suggesting an 85.2% decline from the year-ago actuals.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/91/94605.jpg?v=871494256" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Joby has a decent earnings history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, missing the mark once and reporting in-line earnings on the other occasion. The average beat is 4.5%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Joby Aviation Stock Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Joby Aviation, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/a3/1740059822.png" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" title="" /> </p><p>Joby Aviation, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Joby Aviation, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2>JOBY Earnings Whispers for Q4</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for JOBY this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">JOBY has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><h2>Factors Likely to Shape JOBY&rsquo;s Q4 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">We expect Joby Aviation&rsquo;s fourth-quarter bottom-line performance is likely to have been affected by high operating expenses. Elevated research and development costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses are likely to have pushed up operating costs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Heavy investments might have also hindered the company&rsquo;s prospects. With JOBY focusing on the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) space, R&amp;D expenses are likely to have been high. Developing the necessary infrastructure, overcoming regulatory roadblocks and gaining public acceptance are all critical hurdles. Moreover, the cost-intensive nature of eVTOL development seeks additional capital, which can pose challenges for companies like Joby Aviation.</p><h2>JOBY Stock Underperforms Industry &amp; ACHR</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">JOBY stock has not had an outstanding run on the bourses in a year. JOBY stock has gained 25%, performing worse than the&nbsp;transportation airline industry&rsquo;s 35.3% uptick in the same timeframe. Another eVTOL-focused stock <strong>Archer Aviation</strong> ACHR has performed even better, surging 99.2%.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One-year JOBY Stock Price Comparison</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f1/94606.jpg?v=1863233623" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>JOBY Shares Trading at Premium</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">From a valuation perspective, Joby Aviation is trading at a premium compared to the industry average. In terms of price-to-book value, JOBY is trading at 7.44X, higher than its three-year median of 3.57X and the industry&rsquo;s 5.15X.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/0f/94611.jpg?v=1735602125" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Investment Thesis for JOBY Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Given its focus on urban air mobility, JOBY&rsquo;s offerings are likely to include advanced booking systems, partnerships with ride-sharing platforms, and dedicated service routes. Joby Aviation plans to develop facilities capable of producing up to 500 eVTOL aircraft annually in Dayton. JOBY&rsquo;s partnerships with the Department of Defense, <strong>Toyota </strong>TM and <strong>Uber Technologies</strong> UBER bode well.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Joby Aviation is unlikely to be profitable any time soon as commercial production is yet to start. In its path toward commercialization, JOBY is unlikely to escape turbulence as it navigates regulatory approvals, infrastructure development and adoption by consumers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the absence of commercialization, there is no real demand for urban air mobility at present. Only time will tell, how the market and customer demand for eVTOLs turn out to be. Additionally, the risk of battery failure due to high voltage and thermal issues is highly existent for eVTOL aircraft.&nbsp;</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">We can safely conclude that investors should refrain from rushing to buy JOBY, which is facing quite a few challenges in addition to a premium valuation, ahead of its earnings release on Feb. 26. Instead, they should monitor the developments pertaining to the stock closely for a more appropriate entry point, as an erroneous and hasty decision could affect portfolio gains.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2419035/joby-s-q4-earnings-coming-up-time-to-buy-sell-or-hold-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2419035">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Zoom Video</strong> ZM is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Feb. 24.<br /><br />Zoom expects fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues between $1.175 billion and $1.18 billion. For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.18 billion, suggesting a 2.77% rise from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.<br /><br />Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected in the range of $1.29-$1.30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at $1.31 per share, indicating a decline of 7.75% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. The figure has remained unchanged over the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ea/94601.jpg?v=1296589181" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar</strong></em>.<br /><br />Zoom Video has a positive earnings surprise history. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 5.34%. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 14.29%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Zoom Communications, Inc. Stock Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Zoom Communications, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/cc/1740058546.png" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zoom Communications, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Zoom Communications, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Whispers for ZM Shares</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Zoom Video this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />ZM has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors to Note for ZM Ahead of Fiscal Q4 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As Zoom prepares to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings, investors may want to consider holding their positions or waiting for a more attractive entry point. The company showed modest improvement in the fiscal third quarter with revenue growth of 3.6% year over year, ending the prolonged deceleration that began following the pandemic boom. This gradual stabilization suggests Zoom&#39;s transformation from a video meeting provider to an AI-first work platform is gaining traction, albeit slowly.<br /><br />For fourth-quarter fiscal 2025, management guided approximately 2.7% year-over-year revenue growth at the midpoint. This modest growth forecast indicates that the company continues to navigate a challenging environment where enterprise customers remain cautious with spending. Investors should monitor enterprise customer metrics, particularly the number of customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenues, which grew 7.1% year over year in the fiscal third quarter.<br /><br />Zoom&#39;s strategic initiatives might have influenced fourth-quarter performance. The December introduction of Zoom Workplace for Education could strengthen its position in the education sector while making the Video SDK available to resale partners might have expanded its developer ecosystem. However, these initiatives are likely to impact Q4 results given their late-quarter timing.<br /><br />The company&#39;s AI investments represent both opportunity and risk. AI Companion 2.0 and upcoming paid add-ons for healthcare and education could eventually drive growth, but continued AI development has impacted gross margins, which declined to 78.9% in the fiscal third quarter from 79.7% in the previous year. Zoom&#39;s Contact Center and Workvivo offerings showed promising growth in the fiscal third quarter and warrant attention in the upcoming report. The Contact Center business surpassed 1,250 customers (up 82% year over year) and secured its largest-ever deal exceeding 20,000 seats, demonstrating enterprise penetration.<br /><br />The company&#39;s strong balance sheet ($7.7 billion in cash and investments) and share repurchase program ($2 billion authorized) provide downside protection. However, with a trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate of 98% for Enterprise customers, Zoom still faces challenges in fully monetizing its existing customer base during uncertain economic conditions. Given these mixed signals, investors might consider maintaining current positions or waiting for a more compelling entry point following the earnings report.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ZM Stock Price Performance &amp; Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Zoom has emerged as one of the strongest performers with its stock rallying 41.3% in the past six months compared with the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector&rsquo;s growth of 7.7%. The company still faces significant challenges, including intense competition from <strong>Microsoft</strong> MSFT Teams, <strong>RingCentral</strong> RNG and <strong>Cisco</strong> CSCO Webex, which have been aggressively pushing its collaboration tools.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">6-Month ZM Stock Price Performance Comparison</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7b/94602.jpg?v=536631278" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zoom&#39;s premium valuation is reflected in its 3-year forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio of 5.44, higher than the Zacks Internet - Software industry average of 5.1, which suggests high growth expectations but also implies elevated risk. Zoom will need to maintain its technological edge and continue delivering value to its customers to stay ahead of the curve.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">ZM&rsquo;s P/S Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/77/94603.jpg?v=1764671733" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Investment Thesis for Zoom Video</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ZM presents a balanced investment case heading into fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings. While showing early signs of stabilization with 3.6% revenue growth in the fiscal third quarter, the company continues navigating premium competition and cautious enterprise spending. Its transformation into an AI-first work platform shows promise, with Contact Center and Workvivo gaining traction, but AI investments are pressuring margins.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strong financials ($7.7 billion cash, ongoing share repurchases) provide downside protection, but a 98% enterprise net dollar expansion rate signals growth challenges. Given the mixed outlook amid economic uncertainty, investors may consider holding existing positions or awaiting a more attractive entry point following the earnings report.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Zoom&#39;s measured recovery warrants a cautious approach ahead of fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results. With modest growth projections, ongoing AI investments, and strong competition, current shareholders may benefit from holding while monitoring the execution of the AI-first strategy. New investors might find better entry points post earnings when there&#39;s greater clarity on adoption rates for AI Companion add-ons and emerging products like Contact Center and Workvivo.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2419032/zoom-video-q4-earnings-preview-buy-sell-or-hold-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2419032">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Should Howmet Stock be in Your Portfolio After Solid Q4 Earnings? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Howmet Aerospace Inc.</strong> HWM has been on a great run on the bourses lately as the stock is trading close to its 52-week high of $140.55. Shares of the advanced engineered solutions provider for the aerospace and transportation industries closed at $139.39 yesterday, just 0.8% below the highest point.<br /><br />Since the release of its fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 13, HWM stock has gained 8.9%. The stock has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s growth of 1.3% and the aerospace defense industry&rsquo;s decline of 1.6%.<br /><br />The company reported impressive results for fourth-quarter 2024, with non-GAAP earnings of 74 cents per share surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.8%. The figure jumped 40% year over year. Revenues of $1.90 billion beat the consensus estimate by 0.7%. The top line increased 9% year over year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">HWM Stock Outperforms Industry &amp; the S&amp;P 500</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d1/94591.jpg?v=1683649479" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s Behind Howmet Stock&rsquo;s Momentum?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The strongest driver of Howmet&rsquo;s business at the moment is the commercial aerospace market. The strength in air travel continues, with wide-body aircraft demand picking up, thereby supporting continued OEM spending. Pickup in air travel has been a positive as the increased usage of aircraft spurs spending on parts and products that the company provides. Solid demand for air travel is also encouraging airlines to purchase more aircraft, which is again driving its sales.<br /><br />In the fourth quarter, revenues from the commercial aerospace market increased 12.9% year over year, constituting 53% of the company&rsquo;s business. The sustained strength was attributed to new, more fuel-efficient aircraft with reduced carbon emissions and increased spare demand for engines. <strong>The Boeing Company</strong> BA is also anticipated to witness a gradual production recovery, particularly in the 737 MAX aircraft, with an end to its workers&rsquo; strike, which is likely to boost demand for HWM&rsquo;s products in the market.<br /><br />Expanding defense budget remains another growth catalyst for Howmet. While the commercial aerospace market has remained the major driver for the company, the defense side of the industry has also been witnessing positive momentum, cushioned by steady government support. HWM has been witnessing robust orders for engine spares for the F-35 program and other legacy fighters. In the fourth quarter, revenues from the defense aerospace market increased 22% year over year, constituting 16% of the company&rsquo;s revenues.<br /><br />It&#39;s worth noting that in August 2024, the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations approved the fiscal year 2025 Defense Appropriations Act, which provides $852.2 billion in total funding. This reflects a 3.3% increase over the approved funding during fiscal 2024. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for Howmet&#39;s growth, which remains focused on grabbing more defense contracts.<br /><br />Driven by its business strength, Howmet expects to generate revenues in the range of $7.93-$8.13 billion in 2025, indicating year-over-year growth of 8% at the mid-point.<br /><br />Howmet&rsquo;s sound liquidity position is an added strength. Exiting 2024, the company&rsquo;s cash equivalents and receivables were $564 million. It generated net cash of $1.3 billion from operating activities in 2024, much higher than $901 million generated in the previous year. Howmet also generated a healthy free cash flow of $977 million in the year, comprising more than 85% of its net income.<br /><br />HWM&rsquo;s commitment to rewarding its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks is also encouraging.&nbsp; For instance, in 2024, it paid dividends worth $109 million and repurchased shares for $500 million. In January 2025, the company hiked its dividend by 25% to 10 cents per share (annually: 40 cents).&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, in July 2024, its board approved an increase in the share repurchase program by $2 billion to $2.487 billion of its common stock. As of Jan. 31, 2025, HWM&rsquo;s total share repurchase authorization available was $2.15 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">HWM&rsquo;s Earnings Estimate Revision</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Howmet&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has increased 1.6% to $3.22 per share over the past 30 days, indicating year-over-year growth of 19.7%. The consensus mark for 2026 earnings inched up 1.5% to $4.03 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 25.3%. <em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks </strong></em><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8c/94594.jpg?v=590260507" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">HWM Stock Valuation Remains an Overhang</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the positives, Howmet&rsquo;s lofty valuation remains a concern.

<![CDATA[ 3 Best Performing Financial Services Stocks on the S&P 500 Index ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Building on its impressive 23.3% gain in 2024, the S&amp;P 500 Index has jumped 4.5% so far in 2025.<br /><br />Among the sectors that are driving the S&amp;P 500 Index, Financial Services has jumped 8% this year (the second-best performing sector). The momentum is driven by potential favorable changes in the sector under Trump 2.0.&nbsp;<br /><br />While the Financial Services sector comprises several big names, today let&rsquo;s focus on the three best-performing stocks &ndash; <strong>Citigroup </strong>C, <strong>Capital One </strong>COF and <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> GS. These stocks have also outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index and the Zacks Finance sector.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Year-to-Date C, COF &amp; GS Stock Price Performance</strong><br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ef/94579.jpg?v=671937578" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Before discussing the above-mentioned stocks in detail, let&rsquo;s first check out the reasons for investors&rsquo; bullish stance on the Financial Services sector.<br /><br />Since the announcement of the U.S. presidential election results in early November 2024, the Financial Services sector has been in the spotlight. This momentum has carried into 2025, driven by expectations of potential deregulation, relaxed regulatory capital requirements and a pro-business stance under the Trump 2.0 administration.<br /><br />However, uncertainty surrounding the pace of interest rate cuts remains a key challenge. The introduction of Trump tariffs could reignite inflation, potentially prompting the Federal Reserve to adopt a less dovish stance. As a result, the Financial Services sector may face some financial headwinds.<br /><br />So, investors must keep an eye on these factors to make wise investment decisions.</p><h2>3 Top Financial Services Stocks to Invest in Now</h2><p><strong>Citigroup </strong>is undergoing a major overhaul under CEO Jane Fraser to streamline operations and reduce costs. It was restructured into five operating segments, and it plans to eliminate 20,000 jobs by 2026, having already cut 10,000. The bank is also exiting consumer banking in multiple markets to focus on profitable businesses like investment banking (IB) and wealth management. These changes aim to free up capital, boost efficiency and drive a 4-5% revenue CAGR, with $2-2.5 billion in annual savings by 2026.<br /><br />Additionally, Citigroup is advancing its digital strategy with artificial intelligence (AI) tools for employees in eight countries, reaching 140,000 users, with plans for expansion. In late 2024, it invested in Pylon to automate mortgage origination and partnered with Google Cloud to enhance AI and cloud capabilities. Digital users grew 5% year over year in 2024, supporting revenue growth and efficiency.<br /><br />Further, Citigroup is expected to benefit from lower interest rates. The Fed has lowered the interest rates by 100 basis points in 2024 and has hinted at two more cuts this year. In 2024, Citigroup&rsquo;s NII (excluding Markets) declined 1% to $47.1 billion from the year-ago period. For 2025, management expects NII (excluding Markets) to be modestly up, with momentum continuing in 2026.<br /><br />At present, Citigroup sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><strong> Capital One</strong> is a diversified consumer loan provider that operates primarily in the banking and credit card sectors. The company is in the process of acquiring <strong>Discover Financial Services </strong>DFS in an all-stock transaction valued at $35.3 billion. This merger, announced last February, is poised to reshape the credit card industry by creating a vertically integrated payments platform, combining Capital One&#39;s extensive banking operations with Discover Financial&#39;s established card network.&nbsp;<br /><br />The transaction, expected to close by next quarter, has received the approval of the Delaware State Bank Commissioner, with the consent from the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency still pending. Earlier this week, shareholders of COF and DFS gave their nod to the deal.<br /><br />The DFS merger is crucial for Capital One&#39;s ambition to build a globally competitive payments network, enabling it to better compete with bigger industry players like Visa and Mastercard. The company projects that the merger will generate $2.7 billion in pre-tax synergies and be more than 15% accretive to adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share by 2027.<br /><br />Over the years, Capital One has been engaged in strategic acquisitions. These reflect its revenue diversifying efforts. Revenue prospects look encouraging given the company&rsquo;s solid credit card and online banking businesses, Discover Financial buyout and decent loan demand.&nbsp;<br /><br />Currently, Capital One carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).<br /><br /><strong>Goldman</strong>, one of the world&rsquo;s leading investment banks, is undergoing a strategic transformation. The company is scaling back its consumer banking operations to refocus on its core strengths &ndash; IB and trading.<br /><br />Per the Wall Street Journal, in November 2024, Apple proposed that Goldman exit their consumer banking partnership within 12-15 months, potentially affecting the Apple Card and Apple Savings account. In October 2024, GS finalized a deal to transfer its GM credit card business to Barclays. The company also sold GreenSky and Personal Financial Management units in late 2023. Also, it plans to discontinue unsecured loans through Marcus, having already sold most of its loan portfolio that year.<br /><br />The IB industry saw strong growth in 2024, driven by a rebound in corporate debt, equity issuances and deal-making. After two years of sluggish performance, global M&amp;A activity surged. According to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, nearly 37,800 transactions were announced or completed last year.<br /><br />Goldman&rsquo;s IB revenues had declined 47.9% in 2022 and 15.5% in 2023. However, the trend reversed in 2024, with revenues jumping 24% to $7.73 billion. The company retained its #1 ranking in announced and completed M&amp;A deals and was placed third in equity underwriting. With a strong deal pipeline and a robust IB backlog, the company&rsquo;s leadership position continues to provide a competitive advantage.<br /><br />Goldman also sports a Zacks Rank #1, at present.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2419031/3-best-performing-financial-services-stocks-on-the-s-p-500-index?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|investment_ideas-2419031">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Unity Software: Earnings Beat Sparks Breakout ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 19:47:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Unity Software Company Overview</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock <strong>Unity Software (</strong></span></span>U<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>) </strong>is a leading platform for creating interactive, real-time 3D content. Though Unity Software is most recognized for video game development, the company&rsquo;s tools are implemented across various industries, including film, animation, automotive, architecture, and more. Unity&rsquo;s products provide clients with many features that allow them to design, develop, and deploy interactive experiences on multiple platforms, from mobile devices and consoles to virtual and augmented reality headsets.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Unity Smashes Earnings Expectations</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">There is no more significant stock catalyst on Wall Street than a strong earnings report, and on Wednesday night, Unity Software delivered the goods. Sales of $457M beat estimates of $433M, while EBITDA of $106M crushed Wall Street expectations of $85 million amid increased revenue from the company&rsquo;s core offerings. CEO Matt Bromberg: <strong><em>&quot;Our Q4 results exceeded expectations in both revenue and profitability, reflecting our efforts to build a stronger Unity. With the success of Unity 6, a new pricing model, and growing AI integration, we&rsquo;re optimistic about our future and committed to delivering value to our customers and shareholders.&quot;</em></strong></span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Breakaway Gap Above Pivot</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When a stock like U gaps up as much as it did this morning, investors may feel they are chasing if they don&rsquo;t already own shares. However, a strong earnings report, a high short interest (~8% of the float is short), and a rotation on higher time frames (monthly bullish engulfing candle) often lead to much higher prices. Meanwhile, U is attempting to break out of a double-bottom base structure as volume swells to ~900% above the 50-day average here intraday.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1f/94643.jpg?v=1617546717" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: TradingView</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Meanwhile, the January highs give us a level to &ldquo;trade against&rdquo; and manage risk.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Apple Vision Pro + Unity Software</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In 2023, Unity partnered with <strong>Apple (</strong></span></span>AAPL<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>)</strong> to provide 3D apps for the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vision Pro&rdquo; headset. Unity&rsquo;s Apple business is growing, and some highlights of successful Vision Pro projects include:</span></span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Don Julio App:</strong> Trigger XR used Unity to create an immersive experience showcasing the tequila brand&#39;s history and craftsmanship. &nbsp;</span></span></li><li><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>LEGO Builder&#39;s Journey:</strong> Light Brick Studio leveraged Unity to bring their game to Vision Pro, overcoming rendering and optimization challenges.</span></span></li></ul><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Management Uncertainties Answered</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Investors never like uncertainty, especially when it comes to management teams. Unity quelled those concerns this quarter by hiring in key leadership positions, including a new CTO and CFO.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>AI Will Drive Growth at Unity Software</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The enormous strides in AI technology over the past few years are an essential part of the U bull case. AI will help Unity to develop and optimize its gaming segment, while making it more efficient and cheaper.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Bottom Line</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Unity Software&rsquo;s recent earnings beat, breakaway gap, and leadership certainty signal a bright future for the stock over the next 6-12 months.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2419028/unity-software-earnings-beat-sparks-breakout?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-investment_ideas-2419028">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ BAX Stock Surges Following Q4 Earnings & Sales Beat, Margins Decline ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:31:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Baxter International Inc. </strong>BAX reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 58 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents by 11.5%. The bottom line declined 10.8% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level due to a surge in costs and expenses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss per share of 95 cents against EPS of 43 cents in the prior-year quarter. The significant loss was due to special items, primarily related to the impact of a Front Line Care goodwill impairment charge, business optimization costs, Hurricane Helene costs and separation-related costs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reported adjusted EPS from continuing operations, Medical Products &amp; Therapies, Healthcare Systems &amp; Technologies and Pharmaceuticals segments of 49 cents compared with 43 cents in the year-ago period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>See Zacks Earnings Calendar.</em></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Revenue Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues from continued operations totaled $2.75 billion, up 0.9% on a reported basis and 2% at constant currency (cc). The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of BAX were up 8.4% in pre-market trading following better-than-expected quarterly results. The company&rsquo;s shares have lost 14.8% in the past six months against the industry&rsquo;s growth of 9.2%. The broader S&amp;P 500 Index has moved up 10% in the same period.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/85/94619.jpg?v=1668416829" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Segmental Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Baxter completed its transformation plan, announced in February 2023, with the completion of the sale of its Kidney Care business last month. The company expects its streamlined businesses to offer new opportunities to redefine healthcare delivery and drive profitable growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As part of its transformation plan, Baxter established its new operating model, integrating its prior matrixed structure of nine businesses (operating across three geographic regions) into the aforementioned four verticalized global segments. The company started reporting under a new model since the third quarter of 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Medical Products &amp; Therapies</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The segment includes Advanced Surgery and a new category, Infusion Therapies &amp; Technologies. Total sales at this segment totaled $1.31 billion, nearly flat year over year reportedly but up 1% at cc. Growth from robust sales of the Novum IQ infusion pump, parenteral nutrition products and Advanced Surgery products was partially offset by reduced sales of IV solutions due to the impact of Hurricane Helene.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Infusion Therapies and Technologies&rsquo; sales totaled $1.02 billion, down 2% year over year reportedly and 1% at cc. Advanced Surgery category sales amounted to $292 million, up 5% year over year reportedly and 6% at cc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Healthcare Systems and Technologies</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The segment includes the Front Line Care category. It also includes the Patient Support Systems and Surgical Solutions categories, which are clubbed as Care &amp; Connectivity Solutions. Total sales in this segment were $784 million, down 1% year over year reportedly as well as at cc. Sales were driven by new sales and upgrades for patient support systems, which were more than offset by certain supply constraints and exits from select markets or product categories.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Front Line Care category sales totaled $280 million, down 8% year over year reportedly as well as at cc. Care &amp; Connectivity Solutions category sales amounted to $504 million, up 2% year over year reportedly and 3% at cc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Pharmaceuticals</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The segment presently includes two product categories &mdash; Injectables &amp; Anesthesia and Drug Compounding. Total sales during the fourth quarter were $643 million, up 8% year over year reportedly as well as at cc. The growth was primarily driven by robust demand for Baxter&#39;s Drug Compounding services, along with strong growth in specialty injectables and additional sales from new launches.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Injectables and Anesthesia category sales totaled $383 million, up 7% year over year reportedly and 8% at cc. The Drug Compounding category sales amounted to $260 million, up 10% year over year reportedly and 9% at cc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Other</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues in the segment amounted to $12 million, down 33% on a year-over-year basis as well as at cc.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Margin Analysis</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Baxter reported an adjusted gross profit of $1.23 billion, up 0.7% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, the adjusted gross margin contracted 10 basis points (bps) to 44.5%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $761 million, up 11.4% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s figure. Research and development expenses totaled $211 million, up 66.1% on a year-over-year basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted operating income from continuing operations totaled $297 million, down 10% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, the adjusted operating margin declined 130 bps to 10.8%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">2025 Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Baxter issued its guidance for first-quarter and full-year 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the first quarter, Baxter anticipates sales from continuing operations to grow 3-4% reportedly and 4% on an operational basis. The adjusted EPS for the period is expected to be in the range of 47-50 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and EPS is pegged at $2.62 billion and 52 cents, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For full-year 2025, continuing operational sales growth is expected to be 5-6% reportedly and 4-5% on an operational basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $11.24 billion, implying a year-over-year improvement of 6.5% reportedly. Adjusted EPS is projected to be in the band of $2.45-$2.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.47.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Baxter International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Baxter International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/63/1740061555.png" title="" width="568" /> <p>Baxter International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Baxter International Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Our Take</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Baxter exited the fourth quarter on a strong note, with both earnings and sales beating estimates. Although declining margins remain a concern, the metric is expected to improve going forward following the transformational plan, which included the spin-off of Kidney Care and BioPharma Solutions businesses. The plan also included a simplified model with a faster and more effective response to macro and micro changes and an enhanced ability to advance innovation for its patients.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The $3.4 billion divestiture of its Kidney Care business, alongside the earlier sale of BioPharma Solutions and a shift to a vertical operating model, enhances operational efficiency and financial flexibility. BAX plans to use the proceeds from the sale to reduce debt. With a lower debt burden and improved cash flow, Baxter is poised to accelerate innovation and expand in core healthcare segments. Leadership transitions, including the appointment of a new CEO, should shape the next phase of strategic execution, driving sustainable growth and long-term value creation in the years ahead.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Baxter&rsquo;s rapid recovery from Hurricane Helene ensures minimal disruption in 2025. With all manufacturing lines at North Cove restored to pre-hurricane levels, supply continuity is secured. Strong crisis management, infrastructure resilience and proactive coordination with stakeholders position Baxter for stable operations and uninterrupted growth in the coming year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BAX&rsquo;s recent product launches and FDA approvals position it for strong growth in 2025 and beyond. The Novum IQ infusion pumps enhance hospital efficiency, while Clinolipid&rsquo;s expanded indication broadens Baxter&rsquo;s impact on pediatric nutrition. The Vest APX airway clearance system improves respiratory care, and ten new injectable pharmaceuticals strengthen its presence in critical care, anti-infectives, pain management and oncology. These advancements align with Baxter&rsquo;s strategic transformation, reinforcing its focus on high-value, patient-centric solutions.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, Baxter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks from the industry have been discussed below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Avenna Healthcare </strong>AVAH, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated earnings growth rate of 666.7% for 2025. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">AVAH delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 135.00%. The company is expected to release fourth-quarter results in March. Its shares have lost 4% in the past six months against the industry&rsquo;s 2.1% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Penumbra </strong>PEN, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 32.4% for 2025. Its earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, delivering an average surprise of 10.54%. The company is scheduled to release fourth-quarter results on Feb. 18.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PEN&rsquo;s shares have gained 37.6% against the industry&rsquo;s 0.1% decline in the past six months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Masimo </strong>MASI, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated growth rate of 9.5% for 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MASI&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 17.10%.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Valaris Limited&nbsp;</strong>VAL, an offshore drilling services provider, has announced that it will permanently retire three semi-submersible rigs as part of its efforts to streamline its drilling fleet. Additionally, the offshore driller has announced the sale of a jack-up rig for $24 million. The three semi-submersible rigs are expected to be out of service and permanently removed from the global drilling supply.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company will retire the three semi-submersibles &mdash; VALARIS DPS-5, VALARIS DPS-3 and VALARIS DPS-6. VALARIS DPS-5 has remained inactive since the completion of its last assignment in the third quarter of 2024,while VALARIS DPS-3 and VALARIS DPS-6 have been cold-stacked in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for the past several years. The retired drilling rigs might be upcycled to be used for alternative purposes or scrapped entirely.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The offshore driller announced the sale of the Valaris 75&nbsp;jack-up rig, which has been out of service for the past five years in the Gulf of Mexico. The jack-up rig was sold to an undisclosed operator. The purchase and sale agreement (SPA) for this rig included a clause stating that any future operation undertaken by the rig shall be confined to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Valaris stated that it plans to continuously optimize its fleet by divesting the rigs that do not provide adequate returns to justify the cost of maintaining them. By retiring its idle assets, the company plans to focus on high-specification vessels within its fleet and cut costs associated with the cold-stacked rigs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">VAL mentioned that the three semi-submersibles show limited potential for lucrative opportunities in the long term and divesting these assets should benefit its cash flow and upgrade its rig fleet.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">VAL&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">VAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks from the energy&nbsp;sector are <strong>SM Energy </strong>SM, <strong>Equinor ASA</strong> EQNR and <strong>Archrock Inc.</strong> AROC. SM Energy currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Equinor and Archrock carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. <strong>You can see&nbsp;</strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here<strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">SM Energy is set to expand its oil-centered operations in the coming years, with an increasing focus on crude oil, especially in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford regions. The increased production, combined with the favorable oil price environment, is expected to positively contribute to its bottom line.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Equinor ASA is one of the leading integrated energy companies globally and the second-largest supplier of natural gas in Europe. The company&rsquo;s expansion in the renewable energy space positions it for long-term growth as more and more countries transition toward cleaner energy solutions to meet their climate goals. Its strategic pivot toward low-carbon energy solutions unlocks new revenue streams in the growing market for clean energy and carbon management solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Archrock is an energy infrastructure company based in the United States, with a focus on midstream natural gas compression. It provides natural gas contract compression services and generates stable fee-based revenues.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2419021/valaris-streamlines-drilling-fleet-sells-jack-up-rig-for-24m?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_energy_sector-2419021">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

The top line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.89%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Excluding the impact of foreign exchange of $28 million, acquisitions of $5 million and divestitures and discontinuations of $29 million, revenues increased 9% organically.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BHC&rsquo;s shares have lost 24.3% year to date against the industry&rsquo;s growth of 3.1%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f3/94599.jpg?v=331868840" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>BHC&#39;s Q4 Quarter in Detail</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reports revenues under five segments &mdash; Salix, International, Diversified Products, Solta Medical and Bausch + Lomb.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Salix revenues totaled $634 million, up 9% year over year. Within this segment, Xifaxan revenues were up 16%, led by strong growth in underlying demand.

The figure missed both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $294 million and our model estimate of $291.3 million. Revenues increased 1% organically (excluding the impact of foreign exchange and divestitures and discontinuations), driven by solid growth in Canada and EMEA.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Solta Medical reported revenues of $138 million, up 34% year over year. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $115 million and our model estimate of $110.7 million. Revenues were up 35% organically, primarily driven by South Korea and China.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Diversified Product revenues amounted to $228 million, down 12% from the year-ago level.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Neurology posted a 1% year-over-year increase. Sales from the Dentistry business were down 17% year over year. The Generics business was down 68%. The Dermatology business was down 13% as the launch of Cabtreo was offset by discontinuations and pricing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cabtreo (fixed-dose, triple-combination topical treatment for acne vulgaris) was approved in Canada in the third quarter and launched in October 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Diversified Product revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $253 million and our model estimate of $271.4 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues from Bausch + Lomb totaled $1.3 billion, up 9% year over year.&nbsp; The figure beat both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $1.2 billion. Bausch + Lomb&rsquo;s revenues increased 10% organically on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth across all business units.</p><h2>BHC&rsquo;s 2024 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues amounted to $9.62 billion, which rose 10% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.58 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted earnings per share of $3.75 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.73.</p><h2>BHC&#39;s Pipeline Development</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The phase II study on amiselimod, a new oral S1P receptor modulator that targets the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC), completed enrollment. BHC also submitted a draft protocol to the FDA for a phase III study for moderate to severe UC patients. The company met all major regulatory bodies and feedback is under review.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The phase III studies in the RED-C program on rifaximin for the prevention and delay of the first episode of hepatic encephalopathy are in the treatment phase. Top-line results are expected by early 2026.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s program for Clear and Brilliant Touch, a fractionated laser device for skin rejuvenation, is also advancing. In addition to the United States, approvals have been received for Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore in 2024. BHC is awaiting the European regulatory response to the submission.</p><h2>BHC&rsquo;s Guidance for 2025</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">BHC expects revenues to be in the range of $9.9-$10.15 billion. Excluding Bausch + Lomb, revenues are anticipated to be in the band of $4.95-$5.10 billion. Bausch + Lomb revenues are expected to be in the range of $4.950-$5.05 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><p><strong>Bausch Health Cos Inc.

Quote</p></div><h2>Our Take on BHC&rsquo;s Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Bausch&#39;s fourth-quarter results were encouraging, with sales and earnings beating estimates. The guidance for 2025 is also encouraging. The Salix business maintained its momentum on the back of Xifaxan, which witnessed strong growth in underlying demand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bausch Health&#39;s wholly-owned subsidiary, 1261229 B.C. LTD., entered into a financing commitment with a third-party lender to provide a senior secured credit facility of up to $700 million. If funded, BHC expects to repay its 2025 and 2026 debt obligations from the facility&#39;s proceeds, combined with the existing sources of liquidity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If funded, this facility is expected to be secured by a portion of the Bausch + Lomb shares owned by the company. BHC is also looking to access the capital markets to more comprehensively address its maturity profile, which could include pledging a portion of the shares it holds in Bausch + Lomb.</p><h2>BHC&#39;s Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Bausch currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector are <strong>Immunocore Holdings plc</strong> IMCR and <strong>Pacira BioSciences, Inc</strong>. PCRX, both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 90 days, estimates for Immunocore&rsquo;s 2024 loss per share have remained unchanged at 94 cents. Loss per share estimates for 2025 have remained unchanged at $1.62 in the past seven days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">IMCR&rsquo;s earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, the average surprise being 25.57%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, estimates for Pacira BioSciences&rsquo; earnings per share have increased from $2.79 to $3.46 for 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PCRX&rsquo;s earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met once and missed in the other, the average surprise being 7.13%.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2419020/bausch-health-beats-on-q4-earnings-and-revenues-xifaxan-boosts-sales?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2419020">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kontoor Brands, Inc. </strong>KTB announced its preliminary results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, indicating strong performance, strategic execution and growth potential. The company delivered better-than-expected revenues, earnings and cash flow, reinforcing its momentum heading into 2025.<br /><br />The global lifestyle apparel company attributes its strong results to strategic investments, operational efficiencies and brand strength. Leveraging the momentum from Project Jeanius and the newly unveiled acquisition of Helly Hansen, KTB remains well-positioned to generate strong returns and enhance value heading into 2025.<br /><br />Shares of Kontoor Brands, whose portfolio is led by two of the world&rsquo;s most iconic consumer brands, Wrangler and Lee, rose 4.1% during the trading session yesterday. In the past six months, shares of KTB have gained 23.7% compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 22.8%.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">KTB Stock Past Six Months&#39; Performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/38/94574.jpg?v=566675785" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Kontoor Brands&rsquo; Strong Q4 Preliminary Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Kontoor Brands&rsquo; preliminary results for the fourth quarter, ending Dec. 28, 2024, show total revenues of approximately $699 million, up from $670 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, representing a 4% year-over-year increase (5% on a constant-currency basis).<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s preliminary adjusted gross profit for the quarter was $313 million, up from $283 million in the prior year. Adjusted gross margin improved to 44.7%, indicating a 160-basis-point increase, excluding the out-of-period duty charge in that period, while GAAP gross margin was 43.7%.<br /><br />Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) reached $1.38, indicating a 2% increase from the previous year on an adjusted basis, excluding the prior period&#39;s out-of-period duty charge. The previous year&rsquo;s adjusted EPS had also benefited from a one-time tax advantage. When excluding these factors, fourth-quarter adjusted EPS saw robust growth of around 23%. On a GAAP basis, reported earnings were $1.14 per share.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">KTB&rsquo;s Full-Year Metrics</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Cash flow from operations totaled $368 million for fiscal 2024, highlighting the company&#39;s ability to generate robust liquidity. Moreover, year-end inventory was $390 million, indicating a 22% decrease compared with the prior year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Kontoor Brands&rsquo; Strategic Focus for Sustainable Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Kontoor Brands is driving growth through product innovation, market expansion and supply-chain optimization. On its third-quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings call, management highlighted that the company&rsquo;s investments in Project Jeanius aim to enhance operational efficiency and unlock $100 million in cost savings.&nbsp;<br /><br />The company is also focused on category expansion, direct-to-consumer growth and new distribution channels, which will further solidify its global presence. Moreover, leveraging data analytics and digital platforms remains a key priority to enhance customer engagement and drive e-commerce momentum.<br /><br />Another key pillar of Kontoor Brands&rsquo; strategy is brand enhancement and consumer-driven marketing. Wrangler and Lee continue to gain market share, supported by collaborations, refreshed brand positioning and strategic partnerships. The recent acquisition of Helly Hansen aligns with KTB&rsquo;s long-term vision to expand into high-performance apparel. The company is investing in global supply-chain transformation to improve efficiency and ensure faster speed to market.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">KTB&rsquo;s Investment Analysis</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">With a robust fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 preliminary performance, Kontoor Brands continues to demonstrate resilience and strategic growth in the apparel industry. Its focus on brand expansion, digital transformation and operational efficiencies supports long-term value creation. The acquisition of Helly Hansen and investments in Project Jeanius further strengthen its competitive positioning. Currently, Kontoor Brands carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Three Solid Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ralph Lauren Corporation </strong>RL designs, markets and distributes lifestyle products in North America, Europe, Asia and internationally.

<![CDATA[ Are GPC's Shareholder-Friendly Moves Enough to Buy the Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Genuine Parts</strong> GPC has announced a 3% increase in its regular quarterly cash dividend for 2025 with its fourth-quarter 2024 earnings results. The annually payable dividend stands at $4.12 per share, up from $4 per share in 2024, translating to a dividend yield of 3.37% at current price levels. The company has paid out dividends every year since going public in 1948, and this increase marks the 69th consecutive year of a dividend increase.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This steady dividend growth shows GPC&rsquo;s financial strength and reliability, and may boost investor confidence in the stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the trailing 12 months, however, the company&rsquo;s shares have dipped 15.5%, underperforming the Zacks Auto, Tires and Trucks sector&rsquo;s appreciation of 12.4% and the S&amp;P 500 Index&rsquo;s return of 24%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GPC has also lagged its automotive competitors like <strong>O&rsquo;Reilly Automotive</strong> ORLY and <strong>AutoZone</strong> AZO but outperformed peers like LKQ and <strong>Advance Auto Parts</strong> AAP in the same time frame.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While ORLY and AZO shares have gained 24.6% and 24.4%, LKQ and AAP shares have dipped 21.7% and 27.6%, respectively, in the trailing 12-month period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GPC&rsquo;s subpar performance can be attributed to weak market conditions, cost pressures from high inflation and interest rates, and intense competition in the automotive and industrial parts sectors.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One-Year Performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b5/94631.jpg?v=588957381" style="height: 170px; width: 620px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">How then should investors approach the stock? Let us delve deep to find out.</p><h2>GPC Shares Undervalued</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">GPC shares are currently undervalued, as suggested by its Value Score of A. In terms of the forward 12-month price/earnings, the stock is trading at 14.67X, lower than the broader sector&rsquo;s 23.83X.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price/Earnings Ratio (F12M)</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1a/94640.jpg?v=1359363513" style="height: 218px; width: 620px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Acquisitions &amp; Innovations Aid GPC&rsquo;s Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Genuine Parts acquired over 100 companies in 2024, enhancing talent, geographic coverage and capabilities. It has executed four bolt-on acquisitions in Motion to strengthen value-added solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is also rapidly expanding its footprint by increasing its company-owned NAPA stores. NAPA-branded sales in Europe grew 16% year over year in 2024, reaching &euro;500 million. GPC expects penetration to surge beyond 20% over the next four to five years.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Google Cloud and automation have improved catalog search, inventory management and operational efficiency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Genuine Parts is making efforts to improve inventory efficiency with 60,000 new SKUs added in 2024. The expansion of the Indianapolis distribution center has increased capacity and delivery speed, thus optimizing the supply chain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GPC&rsquo;s global restructuring efforts delivered $45 million in 2024, with an additional $100-$125 million in expected savings for 2025. Total annualized savings are expected to reach $200 million by 2026.</p><h2>Weak Markets &amp; Intense Competition Pose Headwinds for GPC</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Genuine Parts is suffering from weak market conditions, which are impacting its profitability. In a soft global automotive market, GPC is facing cost pressures and sluggish demand in key regions like Europe and the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Macroeconomic challenges like high interest rates, cost inflation and political uncertainties are adding to challenges for the company. Rising costs, especially in labor and supply chain operations, are impacting profitability, with Global Automotive segment EBITDA margins declining 70 basis points in 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, GPC faces intense competition in the sale of automotive and industrial parts. As it strives to maintain competitive prices, it may need to lower prices in response to competitors&rsquo; price cuts or promotional activities, potentially leading to a decline in revenues and earnings.</p><h2>GPC&rsquo;s 2025 Earnings Estimates Trend Downward</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Genuine Parts expects total sales growth in the year to be between 2% and 4%. EPS is expected to be between $7.75 and $8.25. Net cash provided by operating activities is anticipated to be in the band of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. The company expects $800 million to $1 billion of free cash flow in 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPC&rsquo;s first-quarter 2025 EPS is currently pegged at $1.95, down by a cent over the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus mark for GPC&rsquo;s 2025 EPS is currently pegged at $8.20, down 1.2% over the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GPC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the trailing four quarters and missed twice, the average negative surprise being 5.23%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Genuine Parts Company Price and Consensus</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Genuine Parts Company Price and Consensus" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/a2/1740065219.png" style="width: 620px; height: 286px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Genuine Parts Company price-consensus-chart | Genuine Parts Company Quote</p></div><h2>GPC Stock: Buy, Sell or Hold?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">While GPC&rsquo;s shareholder-friendly moves, strategic acquisitions and technological advancements bolster its long-term prospects, weak market conditions, intense competition and political uncertainties raise concerns about its growth trajectory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GPC currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

As a result, the quarter also witnessed a rebound in the company&rsquo;s net income.

Other revenues more than doubled year over year to $8.3 million, significantly higher than the consensus mark of $4.5 million. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total operating expenses of $199.1 million escalated 13.2% year over year due to increased legal collection costs and fees.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PRAA recorded a net income of $22.8 million against the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s loss of $5.9 million.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company purchased nonperforming loan portfolios of $432.7 million, which climbed 51.9% year over year.

<![CDATA[ 3 High-Growth Momentum Stocks to Buy for 2025 ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Growth and momentum stocks can offer incredible opportunities, but finding the right ones at the right price can be a challenge. Many high-flying names come with stretched valuations, making them vulnerable to sharp pullbacks. However, some stocks stand out by delivering strong earnings and sales growth, with sturdy price momentum, but still trade at reasonable valuations&mdash;offering a more attractive risk-reward profile.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In this article, we highlight three such stocks&mdash;<strong>Palomar Holdings </strong>(</span></span>PLMR<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">),<strong>Expedia Group </strong>(</span></span>EXPE<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">),and&nbsp;<strong>Gambling.com Group </strong>(</span></span>GAMB<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">), all of which boast <strong>strong fundamentals, top Zacks Ranks, and sustained upside trends.</strong> With bullish outlooks and manageable downside risks, these stocks are well-positioned to outperform in the year ahead.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7b/94648.jpg?v=1123300063" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Gambling.com: High-Growth Stock with Fair Valuation</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Gambling.com is a leading performance marketing company specializing in the online gambling industry. The company provides digital marketing services that connect online gaming operators with new players through its portfolio of websites and proprietary technology. As the online betting market continues to expand&mdash;driven by increasing legalization across the US and Europe&mdash;Gambling.com stands to benefit from rising demand for its services.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Currently holding a <strong>Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)</strong>, GAMB is projected to deliver <strong>impressive revenue growth of 16.4% this year and an even stronger 36.5% next year</strong>. On the bottom line, earnings are expected to surge <strong>74% this year</strong>, followed by a solid <strong>15% increase next year</strong>, highlighting its profitability and scalability. Despite its high-growth trajectory, the stock remains attractively valued, trading at <strong>just 15.8x forward earnings</strong>, a reasonable multiple given its rapid expansion and strong fundamentals.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">With continued momentum in the online gambling industry and robust financial performance, Gambling.com is well-positioned for further upside in 2025.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/bb/94650.jpg?v=645371022" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Palomar Holdings: Boring Stock with Strong Returns</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In a market dominated by AI-driven hype and speculative growth stocks, Palomar Holdingsoffers a fresh alternative&mdash;a steadily growing, profitable business in the often-overlooked insurance sector. While insurance may not be the flashiest industry, it boasts a simple and powerful business model, with predictable cash flows and essential products that remain in demand regardless of economic cycles.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Palomar stands out with a <strong>Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) </strong>rating and extremely robust fundamentals. The company is projected to grow sales by <strong>33.6% this year and another 22.1% next year</strong>, while earnings are expected to rise <strong>25% and 18.3%, respectively</strong>. Further strengthening its investment case, <strong>PLMR trades at just 22.9x forward earnings</strong>, well below the industry average, despite its superior growth.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">With strong price momentum, fair valuation, and consistently rising earnings estimates, Palomar presents a high-growth yet stable opportunity in today&rsquo;s uncertain market&mdash;one that investors shouldn&rsquo;t overlook.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f7/94651.jpg?v=291988422" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Expedia Group: Classic Tech Stock at a Discount Valuation</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Expedia Group is a dominant player in the online travel industry, operating well-known brands such as Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo, and Trivago. As one of the largest online travel agencies, Expedia benefits from a vast network effect, leveraging its scale and technology to drive bookings and revenue growth. Despite concerns about consumer spending, demand for travel remains strong, positioning Expedia for continued expansion.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Expedia enjoys a <strong>Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) </strong>rating and, while it may not deliver the explosive top-line growth seen in some high-flying stocks, it offers a balanced blend of steady revenue expansion and strong earnings growth.Sales are expected to rise <strong>6% this year and 7.3% next year, while earnings are projected to grow 18.2% annually</strong> over the next three to five years, reflecting improving margins and operational efficiency.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">What makes EXPE particularly attractive is its valuation relative to historical levels. The stock currently trades at <strong>a forward earnings multiple of 16.8x, well below its 15-year median of 21.6x</strong>. And with the strong earnings growth forecasts it has a <strong>PEG ratio of 0.9</strong>, which indicates the stock may be cheap based on the metric.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f9/94647.jpg?v=484611761" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Should Investors Buy Shares in GAMB, PLMR and EXPE?</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Each of these stocks offers a unique blend of growth, momentum, and value, making them strong candidates for investors looking to capitalize on high-growth opportunities without taking on excessive risk. Furthermore, they appear to be somewhat overlooked stocks, as I have seen few to no analysts talking about these names.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For investors seeking high-growth opportunities at a reasonable valuation, Gambling.com, Palomar Holdings, and Expedia Group are compelling stocks to consider adding to their portfolio.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2419010/3-high-growth-momentum-stocks-to-buy-for-2025?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-investment_ideas-2419010">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

The top line decreased 9.2% year over year due to lower contributions from its Chemical and Midstream &amp; Marketing segments.<br /><br />Total revenues in 2024 were $26.88 billion, down 7% from $28.91 billion reported in 2023.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Occidental Petroleum Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/d4/1740066796.png" style="width: 600px; height: 313px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Occidental Petroleum Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Occidental Petroleum Corporation Quote</p></div><h2>OXY&rsquo;s Q4 Segmental Details</h2><p><strong>Oil and Gas</strong> revenues totaled $5.62 billion in the reported quarter, up 3.7% year over year.<br /><br /><strong>Chemical </strong>revenues amounted to $1.21 billion, down 1.2% year over year.<br /><br /><strong>Midstream &amp; Marketing</strong> revenues of $141 million plunged 77.7% year over year.</p><h2>Production &amp; Sales of OXY</h2><p>Total production volume was 1,463 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d).

<![CDATA[ Investor Sentiment at 15-Year High: ETFs in Focus ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">According to a Bank of America Corp. survey, investor risk appetite has reached its highest level in 15 years, with global equities emerging as the most favored asset class, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. Fund managers&rsquo; cash holdings have dropped to their lowest levels since 2010, and 34% of respondents expect global stocks to be the best-performing assets in 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, a net 11% of participants reported being underweight in bonds. This bullish stance is supported by expectations of strong economic growth and lower U.S. interest rates in 2025. Overall investor optimism, measured by cash levels, equity allocations, and global growth expectations, rose to 6.4 from 6.1 but remains below the &quot;frothy&quot; levels recorded in December 2024.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Equity Rally Driven by AI and Economic Resilience</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since late 2022, global stocks have surged over 60%, thanks to the optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and the belief that the U.S. recession has been averted. Initially driven by a handful of U.S. technology stocks, the rally is now expanding as investors shift toward undervalued European equities. The <strong>Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF </strong>VGK trades at a P/E of 13.0Xwhile <strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust </strong>SPY has a P/E of 17.86X.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Rotation From Overvalued U.S. Stocks to European Markets</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The survey revealed that 89% of respondents believe U.S. equities are overvalued &mdash; the highest percentage since at least April 2001. Confidence in &quot;U.S. exceptionalism&quot; has weakened, with investors increasingly favoring European stocks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Euro Stoxx Index is now expected to outperform the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 in 2025. So far this year, the European benchmark has gained 12%, while the Nasdaq 100 has risen by 5%. <strong>Vanguard European Stock Index Fund ETF </strong>VGK is up 11% so far this year while the best-performing European ETF of this year has been <strong>iShares MSCI Poland ETF</strong> EPOL. The ETF EPOL is up 23.2% this year (as of Feb. 17, 2025).</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Fading Global Recession Concerns and Fed Rate Cut Expectations</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Investor fears of a global recession have dropped to a three-year low. Additionally, 77% of fund managers anticipate that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2025. &quot;Long Magnificent 7&quot; remains the most popular trade, followed by long positions in the U.S. dollar and cryptocurrency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This sentiment puts focus on ETFs like <strong>Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF</strong> MAGS, <strong>Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund </strong>UUP and <strong>iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF</strong> IBIT. While these ETFs haven&rsquo;t performed well so far this year, investors&rsquo; optimism around them makes them worth watching. AI ETFs are also good bets. <strong>ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF </strong>THNQ is up 12.5% this year and 25% over the past year.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Bullishness on China Is Up </span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, sentiment on China turned positive for the first time in four months, potentially influenced by AI startup DeepSeek. Investors see accelerating growth in China and productivity gains as the most positive drivers for risk assets in 2025. <strong>iShares China Large-Cap ETF</strong> FXI has advanced 18.5% so far this year (as of Feb. 17, 2025) (read: DeepSeek Buzz Boosts China Tech ETFs).</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Any Wall of Worry?</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A global trade war in the Trump 2.0 era and a sharp, disorderly rise in bond yields have been held as the biggest threats. A less-dovish Fed has led to an increase in bond yields lately.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2419012/investor-sentiment-at-15-year-high-etfs-in-focus?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2419012">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sallie Mae</strong> SLM stock touched a 52-week high of $32.65 during yesterday&rsquo;s trading session before closing at $32.53.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock price of private student lender Sallie Mae has surged driven by anticipation that the Trump administration could push for privatization, shifting the federal education loan program from direct government lending to bank-based loans. Per the Wall Street Journal, the Trump administration is weighing executive actions to dismantle the US Education Department to seize control of federal spending and slash the size of the government workforce.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SLM shares have risen 68% over the past year, surpassing both its industry and close peers &mdash; <strong>Ally Financial Inc. </strong>ALLY and <strong>Navient Corporation</strong>&nbsp; NAVI.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Price Performance</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/19/94580.jpg?v=1535443891" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Other Factors Driving SLM Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fed&rsquo;s Rate Cut to Aid NII:</strong> The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 100 basis points in 2024 and indicated two rate cuts this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These cuts are expected to stabilize funding costs, setting the stage for future net interest income (NII) growth. As funding starts to improve, companies like SLM, NAVI and ALLY will be well-positioned to benefit from the favorable environment. With rising loan balances, these companies are expected to experience sustained NII growth in the upcoming period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SLM&rsquo;s NII witnessed a negative compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.8% over the last six years (ended 2024). The Fed rate cuts are expected to gradually stabilize funding costs, providing a favorable outlook for loan providers. Thus, SLM is expected to benefit as improved funding conditions support NII expansion. Additionally, Sallie Mae&#39;s efforts to increase the amount of cash and cash equivalents held to gain from yields on cash and other short-term investments will bolster NII growth in the upcoming period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improving Student Loan Business: </strong>Sallie Mae&rsquo;s growth initiatives are impressive. The company has been trying to enhance its private student loan business by maintaining a strong capital position and introducing multiple complementary products.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Private education loan originations witnessed a six-year CAGR of nearly 1% (2018-2024). In 2024, the company&rsquo;s private education loan origination rose 10% from 2023. For 2025, the company expects 6-8% year-over-year growth in private education loan origination.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Business Expansion Efforts:</strong> The company is also focusing on expanding its business operations on the back of investments in varied product offerings and inorganic activities. In 2023, it acquired several vital assets, technology, intellectual property and experienced staff of Scholly &mdash; a scholarship publishing and servicing platform.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2022, Sallie Mae strengthened its position by acquiring Nitro College, a digital marketing and education solutions company, through a deal with Epic Research LLC. This strategic acquisition enhances SLM&rsquo;s outreach and brand presence, improves its digital marketing capabilities and reduces customer acquisition costs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Such initiatives support the company&#39;s goal of evolving into a comprehensive education solutions provider, ultimately driving increased loan originations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Superior Return on Equity (ROE): </strong>Sallie Mae&rsquo;s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) reflects its superiority in terms of utilizing shareholders&rsquo; funds. The company&rsquo;s ROE of 31.66% compares favorably with the industry&rsquo;s figure of 13.06%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Few Concerns Prevail for SLM Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rising Expenses: </strong>Elevated expenses are concerning for Sallie Mae. The company&rsquo;s non-interest expenses witnessed a CAGR of 1.9% over the last six years (2018-2024).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Though the company focuses on lowering servicing and acquisition costs, and continues to gain efficiencies from operations, we believe that an increasing expense trend will hinder bottom-line growth in the upcoming quarters.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>High Debt Level:</strong> As of Dec. 31, 2024, SLM had long-term borrowings worth $6.4 billion and cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 billion. The company carries a greater debt level than its liquidity position. Hence, SLM has a higher possibility of defaulting on interest and debt repayments if the economic situation worsens.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Should You Buy SLM Stock Now?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Sallie Mae&rsquo;s investments in varied product offerings and inorganic activities to expand business operations and a focus on improving private student loan business are likely to support its financials in the upcoming period.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Sales Estimate</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8d/94584.jpg?v=386451342" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: center;">Earnings Estimate</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1e/94585.jpg?v=1382061096" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, an elevated expense base and high debt levels are near-term concerns for Sallie Mae.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From a valuation standpoint, SLM appears somewhat expensive relative to the industry. The company is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 10.48X, above the industry average of 10.21X.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Price-to-Earnings</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ed/94581.jpg?v=436559633" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, we advise investors not to rush to buy SLM stock right now; instead, keep this stock on their radar and analyze how the company navigates through increasing expenses and interest rate cuts to optimize its financial performance in the upcoming period.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SLM currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ Here's Why You Should Add PNC Financial to Your Portfolio Now ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s PNC strategic initiatives and revenue growth look impressive. Decent liquidity aids steady capital distributions, increasing investor confidence in the stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has also been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts&rsquo; optimism about its prospects. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 and 2026 moved upward.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Estimate Revision Trend</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/04/94596.jpg?v=503416809" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company gained 37.1% over the past year compared with 57% growth recorded by the industry.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Price Performance</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c1/94590.jpg?v=84431761" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Notably, PNC Financial has a number of other aspects that make it an attractive investment option.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Here&rsquo;s Why PNC Financial is an Attractive Buy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> PNC continues to make steady progress toward improving its top line. The company&#39;s fee income has grown, seeing a six-year CAGR (2018-2024) of 1.4%. Net interest income (NII) witnessed a CAGR of 5.6% over the past six years ended 2024. The company expects its NII to benefit from fixed asset repricing over the next couple of years.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2025, management expects NII to increase 6-7% year over year and fee income to rise 5% from the year-ago reported figure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 6% compared with the S&amp;P 500 average growth rate of 4.5% indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Earnings Strength:</strong> Earnings are anticipated to display an upswing in the near term, as the company&rsquo;s projected EPS growth (F1/F0) is 9.92% compared with the S&amp;P 500 average rate of 8.15%. Also, PNC Financial surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters and recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 9.77%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Strategic Initiatives:</strong> In a move to strengthen its domestic presence, PNC Financial is set to expand its branch network across the United States. In February 2024, the company announced its plans to invest $1 billion to enhance its coast-to-coast branch network by opening more than 100 locations in key cities, such as Austin, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami and San Antonio.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the bank aims to renovate more than 1,200 existing branches to strengthen its presence in current markets. This will enhance accessibility and convenience for its customers.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In November 2024, the company announced plans to increase its branch investment by $500 million and bring the total investment to $1.5 billion to open more than 200 branches across 12 U.S. cities and renovate 1,400 existing locations over the next five years.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By concentrating on key growth markets, particularly in the Southwest, PNC Financial has witnessed significant success in expanding its customer base and increasing the number of checking accounts in 2024. With the addition of these branches, it will solidify its position as one of the largest retail banks in the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Solid Liquidity Position:</strong> PNC Financial enjoys a decent liquidity position. As of Dec. 31, 2024, its total available liquidity (comprising cash and due from banks as well as interest-earning deposits in banks) was $41.2 billion, which increased sequentially. While the company had total borrowed funds of $61.7 billion as of the same date, it declined from the previous quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The bank&rsquo;s senior debt enjoyed investment-grade credit ratings of A-, A and A3 from Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s, Fitch and Moody&rsquo;s, respectively. This will enable the company to access the debt market at favorable rates. Hence, we believe that PNC Financial will be able to meet its debt obligations in the near term, even if the economic situation worsens.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Impressive Capital Distribution: </strong>PNC continues to progress with its capital distribution strategy. In July 2024, it sequentially hiked quarterly cash dividends on common stock by 3.2% to $1.60 per share.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past five years, the company has increased its dividend four times, with an annualized dividend growth rate of 9.1%. It currently has a payout ratio of 46%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from regular dividend hikes, PNC Financial has a share repurchase program in place. A 100-million share repurchase plan was authorized in the second quarter of 2022. In 2024, the company repurchased 0.5 billion of its common shares under its share repurchase program.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given PNC&rsquo;s earnings and liquidity strength, its capital-distribution activities seem sustainable and are likely to stoke investors&rsquo; confidence in the stock.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space are <strong>Citigroup </strong>C and <strong>JP Morgan</strong> JPM, each flaunting a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Citigroup&rsquo;s earnings estimates have been unchanged at $7.53 per share over the past 30 days. C&rsquo;s share price has increased 42% over the past six months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">JPM&rsquo;s earnings estimates have been unchanged at $18.10 per share over the past 30 days. Its share price has increased 30.3% over the past six months.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2419009/here-s-why-you-should-add-pnc-financial-to-your-portfolio-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2419009">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gildan Activewear Inc.</strong> GIL has reported impressive fourth-quarter 2024 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, revenues and earnings grew year over year.

The figure increased 10.7% from adjusted earnings of 75 cents in the prior-year quarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />Net sales were $821.5 million, up 5% year over year. Excluding the impacts of the Under Armour phase-out, net sales grew in the low-double digits. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $793 million.&nbsp;<br /><br />Regarding segments, Activewear sales totaled $714.1 million, marking a 10.9% year-over-year increase, driven by higher sales volumes. Positive POS trends were observed across channels and product lines, with market share gains in key growth categories.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the Hosiery and Underwear category, net sales declined 22.6% year over year to $107.4 million, aligning with expectations due to the Under Armour phase-out. However, excluding this impact, sales in the category increased in the high-single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>GIL Stock Past Three-Month Performance</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/bd/94600.jpg?v=1561104963" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Gildan Activewear&rsquo;s Regional Performance Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the United States, sales reached $730.6 million, reflecting a 4.4% increase from $699.5 million in the prior year.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Zeta Global</strong> ZETA will report its fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 25, after market close.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>See Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus estimate for total earnings is pinned at 23 cents per share, implying a 35.3% year-over-year rise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $295 million, suggesting 40.3% growth on a year-over-year basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/66/94608.jpg?v=1369990946" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters and missed in the remaining two, delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 10.5%.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Zeta Global Holdings Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Zeta Global Holdings Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="266" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/ab/1740060518.png" title="" width="568" /> </h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Zeta Global Holdings Corp. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Zeta Global Holdings Corp. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zeta Global&rsquo;s Lesser Chance of Q4 Earnings Beat</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for ZETA this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zeta Global has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AI Led Innovations to Have Been ZETA&rsquo;s Driver in Q4</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Zeta Global&rsquo;s AI-powered intelligent mobile solution allows marketers to leverage AI to activate and coordinate bespoke cross-channel campaigns that deliver improved customer experiences. We anticipate this innovation to have enhanced consumer interactions, thereby driving more business and resulting in better business outcomes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the expanded lineup of gen-AI in the company&rsquo;s marketing platform has been evident in boosting customer demand. Such outcomes lead us to believe that the top line is likely to have grown on the back of customer wins and expansion in existing contracts.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zeta Global Stock Soars</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ZETA shares have skyrocketed 133.7% in a year, outperforming the 111.2% surge of its industry and the 24.4% growth of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite. The company&rsquo;s industry peers, <strong>LiveRamp</strong> RAMP and <strong>BIT Mining Limited</strong> BTCM have underperformed ZETA significantly. RAMP has lost 8.3% and BTCM has plummeted 42.6% over the same period.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One-Year Price Performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b2/94609.jpg?v=147638688" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ZETA Global&rsquo;s stock is looking cheaper and is currently trading at a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 28.5, well below the industry&rsquo;s 47.8X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/de/94615.jpg?v=1597467834" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ZETA&rsquo;s Investment Considerations</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Zeta Global is building upon its existing assets via the LiveIntent Buyout, which expands publisher monetization, augments the company&rsquo;s brand-new mobile and retail solutions, and improves ZETA&rsquo;s data cloud. The rising capabilities are being recognized by industry analysts in the marketplace.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company benefits from a rising Request for Proposal pipeline, driven by ZetaLive and positive industry analyst recognition pointing at future deal wins. Improvement in scale customer average revenues per user portrays ZETA&rsquo;s efficient customer base monetization capabilities. This, coupled with increasing total scaled customers and brands, paves a path for sustained growth for Zeta Global, making it an attractive investment opportunity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, investors might investigate the company&#39;s aim to pay a bulk of LiveIntent&rsquo;s acquisition-related expenses in the fourth quarter of 2024, which might affect the bottom line. Furthermore, Zeta Global&rsquo;s agency customers take a longer time to pay their bills, which might affect the cash flow. No intentions to pay dividends could be concerning for investors.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Final Thoughts: Hold Zeta Global for Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ZETA&rsquo;s long-term growth is vested in its ability to deliver promising results to its customers using AI-led innovations. Top-line growth is attributable to the surge in customer demand. Buyouts, including LiveIntent, can act in good faith toward expanding Zeta Global&rsquo;s footprint and improving service offerings. However, rising expenses pose a threat to its bottom line, and delays in customer payments can shake cash flows.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While ZETA remains fundamentally strong and possesses a discounted valuation, a better entry point could emerge if the stock undergoes some correction.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2419007/zeta-global-stock-before-q4-earnings-smart-buy-or-risky-move?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2419007">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>The Home Depot, Inc. </strong>HD is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb. 25, before market open. The company&rsquo;s top and bottom lines are expected to have increased year over year in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $39 billion, indicating growth of 12.2% from that reported in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br /><em><strong>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em><br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings per share (EPS) of $3.08 indicates growth of 9.2% from the year-ago period&rsquo;s reported figure. The consensus estimate for EPS has moved up 2.7% in the past 30 days.<br /><br />The Atlanta, GA-based company has been reporting steady earnings despite the softened demand environment. The company has delivered a positive bottom-line surprise trend in the trailing four quarters. The leading home improvement retailer delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 2.3%. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 3.9%. Given its positive record, the question is, can HD maintain the momentum?</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">The Home Depot, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="The Home Depot, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="300" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/63/1740053285.png" title="" width="620" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">The Home Depot, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Home Depot, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2>HD&rsquo;s Earnings Whispers</h2><p>Our proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Home Depot this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />Home Depot has an Earnings ESP of +4.33% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Trends to Monitor Before HD&rsquo;s Q4 Earnings</h2><p>Home Depot&rsquo;s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 performance is expected to show continued top-line recovery, primarily driven by contributions from the recently acquired SRS Distribution Inc. Sales are also likely to have benefited from improved seasonal category engagement and hurricane-related demand from Helene and Milton.<br /><br />On the last reported quarter&rsquo;s earnings call, Home Depot raised its fiscal 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) outlook, citing hurricane-driven demand, the inclusion of SRS results and gains from an additional 53rd week. The company anticipates a 4% year-over-year sales increase for fiscal 2024, supported by a $2.3-billion boost from the 53rd week and $6.4 billion in incremental SRS sales. Our model forecasts a 3.8% year-over-year rise in net sales for fiscal 2024 and an 11% increase for the fourth quarter.<br /><br />Home Depot&rsquo;s &ldquo;One Home Depot&rdquo; investment strategy, focused on supply-chain expansion, technology enhancements and digital improvements, continues to drive growth. Its interconnected retail model has been boosting online traffic and conversions, with about 50% of online orders fulfilled in stores. These trends are expected to have supported digital sales growth in the quarter.<br /><br />However, persistent challenges related to higher interest rates and increased macroeconomic uncertainty are expected to have dented consumer demand for home improvement projects, hurting Home Depot&rsquo;s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 performance. A decline in comparable customer transactions, led by soft sales of big-ticket discretionary categories, has been hurting the overall comparable sales (comps). Additionally, elevated interest rates have been pressuring profitability.<br /><br />On the last reported quarter&rsquo;s earnings call, management projected comps to decline 2.5% for fiscal 2024 (52-week period). Management anticipates net interest expenses for fiscal 2024 at $2.1 billion. Our model predicts comps to fall 2.5% for fiscal 2024 and 2.4% for the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect interest and other income/expenses, net, to increase 27.9% and 18.8%, respectively, for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2024.<br /><br />Home Depot&rsquo;s margins remain under pressure due to higher operating costs and expenses from the SRS acquisition. While the gross margin is affected by an adverse sales mix, lower shrink has helped offset some impacts. On the last reported quarter&rsquo;s earnings call, management projected a fiscal 2024 gross margin of 33.5% and an operating margin of 13.5%, at the low end of prior guidance. The adjusted operating margin is expected to reach 13.8%.<br /><br />GAAP EPS is anticipated to decline 2% year over year, improving from the prior mentioned 2-4% drop, while adjusted EPS is projected to fall 1%, better than the previously stated 1-3% decline. The 53rd week is estimated to add 30 cents per share to EPS. Our model forecasts adjusted EPS of $15.11 for fiscal 2024, indicating a 0.9% year-over-year decline.</p><h2>HD&rsquo;s Price Performance &amp; Valuation</h2><p>Home Depot&rsquo;s shares have gained 8.6% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with the broader industry and the Retail-Wholesale sector&rsquo;s growth of 17.7% and 31.2%, respectively. The HD stock has also lagged the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 24.1% rally in the same period.<br /><br />However, the Home Depot stock has slightly outpaced its arch-rival <strong>Lowe&rsquo;s Companies Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s LOW rise of 8.3% in the past year. Shares of competitors <strong>Williams-Sonoma, Inc.</strong> WSM and <strong>Tecnoglass </strong>TGLS recorded gains of 94.3% and 68.1%, respectively, in the same period.<br /><br />At the current price of $395.43, HD trades at a 10% discount from its 52-week high mark of $439.37, reflecting upside potential.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">HD&rsquo;s One-Year Stock Performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/56/94549.jpg?v=1149319408" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Home Depot&rsquo;s current valuation appears quite pricey. The company trades at a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 25.23X, exceeding the industry average of 23.12X and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s average of 22.71X.<br /><br />Given the premium valuation, investors could face significant risks if the company&#39;s future performance does not meet expectations. The retail market is becoming increasingly competitive and Home Depot&rsquo;s initiatives may not suffice to drive significant growth. Macroeconomic challenges and heightened competition could impede the company&#39;s ability to sustain its current growth trajectory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/59/94550.jpg?v=805842889" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Investment Thesis</h2><p>Home Depot has consistently delivered revenue growth and strong profitability, driven by its leadership in the home improvement market, and strategic investments in technology, digital capabilities and supply-chain efficiency through its &ldquo;One Home Depot&rdquo; plan. With a focus on both DIY customers and professional contractors, the company remains a top choice for homeowners and industry professionals. Its extensive store network, diverse product offerings and expanding online presence position it well to meet growing consumer demand.<br /><br />Home Depot&rsquo;s interconnected retail strategy and advanced technology infrastructure continue to drive web traffic and enhance customer experience. The company is also strengthening its Pro ecosystem, solidifying its competitive edge in the home improvement retail duopoly alongside Lowe&rsquo;s.<br /><br />High employee engagement, expanding online sales and enhanced home delivery services are expected to support ongoing market share growth. The acquisition of SRS Distribution has bolstered its presence in building material distribution, improving service offerings for professional contractors and tradespeople.<br /><br />However, near-term challenges, including weaker consumer demand for big-ticket items and broader economic pressures, suggest a cautious approach before making an investment decision.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As Home Depot approaches its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings release, investors are keen to see if it meets expectations. Deciding whether to invest now can be challenging. While the company&rsquo;s strong market position, strategic initiatives like the &ldquo;One Home Depot&rdquo; plan and solid Pro customer growth are promising, it is important to stay mindful of potential risks. Evaluating these factors ahead of the earnings report can provide valuable insight for a well-informed investment choice.<br /><br />Despite Home Depot&rsquo;s long-term potential, patience is the key. Monitoring developments to identify an optimal entry point is a prudent approach. For current shareholders, holding onto the stock may be a wise move, as the upcoming earnings report is expected to reinforce the company&rsquo;s strong fundamentals.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2419004/home-depot-shows-strength-ahead-of-q4-earnings-is-it-time-to-buy?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2419004">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Gap Stock Slips Under 50-Day Moving Average: Risk or Reward? ]]>
</title>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>The Gap Inc.</strong> GAP stock has been volatile in the past year, driven by mixed trends, highlighted by strength in brands and continued market share growth, offset by an uncertain macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures and other headwinds. As a result, GAP has encountered a notable resistance level, prompting caution among investors from a technical standpoint.<br /><br />Driven by these trends, the GAP stock is trading below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), indicating a bearish outlook and challenges in sustaining the recent performance levels.<br /><br />The SMA is an essential tool in technical analysis that helps investors evaluate price trends by smoothing short-term fluctuations. This approach provides a clearer perspective on a stock&#39;s long-term direction. This technical indicator, coupled with the soft margins outlook, indicates a negative market sentiment and reflects doubts about Gap&rsquo;s financial health and prospects.<br /><br />For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the company projects the gross margin to be similar year over year, excluding roughly one percentage point of deleveraged rent, occupancy and depreciation from soft sales in the quarter due to the absence of the 53rd week.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">GAP Stock Trades Below 50-Day Moving Average</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/4a/94548.jpg?v=1209447809" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shares of Gap have risen 20.2% in the past year, outperforming its industry peer&rsquo;s collective growth of 17.3%. The GAP stock, however, compared unfavorably against the broader Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index&rsquo;s growth of 31.2% and 24.1%, respectively, in the same period.<br /><br />Gap&rsquo;s performance is notably weaker than its close competitors, including <strong>Boot Barn </strong>BOOT, <strong>Genesco </strong>GCO and <strong>Urban Outfitters</strong>&rsquo; URBN growth of 50.9%, 27.8% and 28.4%, respectively.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Gap&rsquo;s One-Year Stock Performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/66/94545.jpg?v=1840393563" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the current share price of $23.01, Gap&rsquo;s stock price reflects a 22.9% premium to the company&rsquo;s recent 52-week low of $18.72. Meanwhile, the GAP stock&rsquo;s price reflects a 24.8% discount from its 52-week high of $30.59.</p><h2>GAP&rsquo;s Estimate Revision Trend</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gap&rsquo;s fiscal 2024 earnings per share was unchanged in the last 30 days. The consensus estimate for fiscal 2025 EPS moved down by a penny in the last 30 days.<br /><br />For fiscal 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPS&rsquo;s sales and EPS implies 0.7% and 41.3% year-over-year growth, respectively. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 sales and earnings indicates 1.9% and 6.1% year-over-year growth, respectively.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/49/94546.jpg?v=456377369" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Does Low P/E Valuation Suggest Growth Prospects?</h2><p>Gap&rsquo;s current valuation suggests that the stock is available at a discounted price compared with the industry average. The GAP stock trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.66X, significantly lower than the Zacks Retail &ndash; Apparel and Shoes industry average of 19.37X and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s average of 22.71X.<br /><br />Similarly, the forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.57X is substantially lower than the industry average of 1.73X and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s average of 5.38X.<br /><br />Although Gap is trading at a low valuation multiple compared with the industry, investors&rsquo; decisions on whether to lock in gains, hold or remain bullish on GAP depend on several factors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/84/94547.jpg?v=1993604202" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>GAP&rsquo;s Long-Term Potential</h2><p>Gap&rsquo;s long-term growth potential is mainly tied to the success of its brands. It has carved out a niche with its four distinct brands &mdash; Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta &mdash; each catering to unique market segments, thus providing diverse revenue streams and reducing overall risk.<br /><br />The company is executing strategic initiatives to revitalize its brands and improve operational efficiency. Management remains focused on four key priorities &mdash; strengthening financial and operational discipline, reinvigorating its brands, enhancing its operating platform, and fostering a strong company culture. Gap is also optimistic about its holiday collection and is committed to improving the customer experience online and in stores.<br /><br />In addition, the company is advancing cost-management efforts to simplify its operations. By increasing spans of control, reducing management layers and standardizing its structure across brands, the company aims to improve decision-making speed and efficiency. These measures are expected to generate $300 million in annualized savings, with plans to optimize marketing spend and streamline technology investments.</p><h2>Is Gap Stock a Buy Opportunity?</h2><p>GAP has solidified its position as a retail apparel leader through strong branding, digital innovation, sustainability efforts and global expansion. By prioritizing product innovation, operational efficiency and a customer-centric approach, the company is well-equipped to navigate the shifting retail landscape and maintain its competitive advantage.<br /><br />However, economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures warrant caution. Consumer confidence, a crucial driver of spending, remains a key risk factor. While the stock appears attractively valued with a low P/E multiple, investors should carefully assess risks and opportunities before making an investment decision.<br /><br />For existing shareholders, holding on to the stock could be a prudent move, given Gap&rsquo;s long-term growth prospects. As the company continues executing its strategic initiatives, its ability to drive sustained performance and shareholder value remains strong. Gap currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sonoco Products Company</strong> SON reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.17 in fourth-quarter 2024, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. The figure was within the company&rsquo;s guided range of $1.15- $1.35. The figure excludes the impact of the Eviosys acquisition that was completed on Dec. 4, 2024.&nbsp; However, including this impact, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.00, 2% lower than the $1.02 in the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Including one-time items, the company reported a loss of 57 cents per share from continuing operations against the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s EPS of 61 cents. Including discontinued operations, fourth-quarter 2024 loss was 44 cents per share compared with 82 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Sonoco Products Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><h2> <img alt="Sonoco Products Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/92/1740067587.png" style="width: 620px; height: 288px;" title="" /> </h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Sonoco Products Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Sonoco Products Company Quote</p></div><h2>SON Witnesses 2% Increase in Q4 Sales</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Sonoco&rsquo;s net sales were $1.36 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.75 billion. The top line was up 2% year over year from the adjusted figure of $1.34 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The increase was attributed to low single-digit volume gains and partial contribution from Eviosys following the completion of its acquisition. This was somewhat offset by the loss of net sales from the divestiture of the Protective Solutions (Protexic) business and the treatment of recycling operations as a procurement function beginning Jan. 1, 2024, as well as lower selling prices.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Including discontinued operations, the company had reported net sales of $1.64 billion in prior year quarter.</p><h2>Sonoco&rsquo;s Margins Contract in Q4</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of sales was $1.08 billion, 3% higher than the year-earlier quarter. The gross profit totaled $283 million, down 1.7% year over year. The gross margin was 20.8% compared with the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s 21.6%.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $221 million, up 25% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted operating income was $127 million, down 5% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s $134 million. The operating margin was 9.3%, down from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s 10.1%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted EBITDA was $247 million, up 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.</p><h2>SON&rsquo;s Segment Performances in Q4</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Consumer Packaging segment&rsquo;s net sales rose 18% year over year to $705 million. The increase reflected partial December sales attributable to Eviosys after its acquisition and year-over-year volume growth in rigid paper containers, partially offset by lower selling prices. The segment&rsquo;s adjusted EBITDA amounted to $100 million, up 9% from the prior-year quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Net sales in the Industrial Paper Packaging segment were $571 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 4%. Gains from higher volumes and higher selling prices were offset by lower sales related to the treatment of recycling as a procurement function effective Jan. 1, 2024. Adjusted segment EBITDA totaled $102 million, reflecting 11.9% year-over-year growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sales for the All Other segment were $88 million, which marked a 40% plunge year over year reflecting the sale of the Protexic business and lower volumes from the remaining businesses. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment totaled $8 million compared with the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s $23 million.</p><h2>Sonoco&rsquo;s Cash Flow &amp; Balance Sheet Updates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">SON reported cash and cash equivalents of $431 million at the end of 2024 compared with $139 million at the end of 2023. The company generated cash flow from operating activities of around $834 million in 2024 compared with $883 million in the prior year. At the end of the year, Sonoco had available liquidity of $1.7 billion, comprising available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and cash on hand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, Sonoco&rsquo;s total debt was around $7 billion, up from $3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sonoco entered into an agreement to sell the Thermoformed and Flexibles Packaging business and its global Trident business (which are collectively known as TFP) to TOPPAN Holdings, Inc. for around $1.8 billion. It intends to pursue strategic alternatives for its remaining temperature-assured cold-chain packaging business. Sonoco plans to use the proceeds from divestitures, along with projected strong free cash flow, to lower debt levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Sonoco&rsquo;s Performance in 2024</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Sonoco&rsquo;s adjusted EPS declined 7% year over year to $4.89. The bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of $5.08 per share. The company&rsquo;s guidance for the year was $5.05-$5.25 per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues decreased 2.5% year over year to $5.3 billion. The metric missed the consensus estimate of $6.7 billion.</p><h2>SON&rsquo;s 2025 Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Sonoco projects adjusted EPS to be between $6.00 and $6.20. Adjusted EBITDA is expected between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. The operating cash flow is expected between $800 million and $900 million.</p><h2>Sonoco&rsquo;s Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">SON shares have lost 15.6% in the past year against the industry&rsquo;s 9.6% growth.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d7/94642.jpg?v=735005385" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>SON&rsquo;s Zacks Rank</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Sonoco&rsquo;s Peer Performances in Q4</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AptarGroup, Inc.</strong> ATR reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.52, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26. The bottom line increased 27% year over year from $1.20 per share (including comparable exchange rates). The company expected fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.22-$1.30.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues increased 1.1% year over year to $848 million. However, the reported figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $858 million. Core sales, excluding currency and acquisition effects, improved 2% year over year as improved performances in Closures and Pharma were offset by the weaker performance of the Beauty segment.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Packaging Corporation of America</strong> PKG reported an adjusted EPS of $2.47 in the fourth quarter of 2024, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.51 by a margin of 2%. The bottom line matched PKG&rsquo;s guidance and grew 16% year over year. The upside was driven by higher prices and mix, improved volume in both segments and lower freight and logistics expenses. However, these gains were somewhat offset by an increase in operating expenses, scheduled maintenance outage expenses, depreciation expenses and other expenses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sales in the fourth quarter rose 10.7% year over year to $2.15 billion due to higher volumes and price/mix in both segments. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Amcor Plc</strong> AMCR reported second-quarter fiscal 2025 (ended Dec. 31, 2024) adjusted EPS of 16 cents, which met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company reported earnings of around 16 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Gains from improved volumes, continued strong cost performance and benefits from restructuring initiatives were offset by unfavorable impacts from price/mix.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Amcor&rsquo;s revenues dipped 0.3% year over year to $3.24 billion. The downside was due to a 1% unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and a 1% impact of pass-through of lower raw material costs. The volume rose 2.3% from the year-ago quarter. Price/mix had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2%, primarily due to lower volumes in high-value healthcare categories. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.44 billion.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418992/sonoco-earnings-miss-estimates-in-q4-sales-increase-2-y-y?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418992">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>Ryanair Holdings</strong> RYAAY have not had a good time on the bourses of late, declining in double-digits over the past year. The disappointing price performance resulted in RYAAY underperforming its&nbsp;industryin the said time frame. Additionally, RYAAY&rsquo;s price performance compares unfavorably with that of other airline operators like <strong>Alaska Air Group, Inc. (</strong>ALK<strong>)</strong> and <strong>Allegiant Travel Company (</strong>ALGT<strong>) </strong>in the same timeframe.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One-Year Price Comparison</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/54/94588.jpg?v=1691677738" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the significant pullback in RYAAY&rsquo;s shares currently, investors might be tempted to snap up the stock. But is this the right time to buy RYAAY? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p><h2>Upbeat Air Travel Demand &amp; Fleet Additions Aid RYAAY</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Passenger volume has been robust at Ryanair following the end of the pandemic and normalization of economic activities. With travel bookings rising across the industry, passenger revenues at Ryanair are also increasing. Because of this air-travel demand strength, RYAAY&#39;s traffic grew 9% year over year despite multiple <strong>Boeing</strong> BA delivery delays during the first nine months of fiscal 2025. Given this encouraging backdrop, Ryanair expects its fiscal 2025 traffic to reach almost 200 million (+9%) passengers, subject to no further adverse news on Boeing delivery delays. This marks an improvement from the prior view of reaching 198-200 million passengers (+8%).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ryanair&rsquo;s fleet-modernization initiatives to cater to the improvement in travel demand are encouraging. The inclusion of modern planes in its fleet and the retirement of the old ones aligns with its environmentally-friendly approach. The new inclusions, apart from having all basic amenities, should result in improved fuel efficiency. By Dec. 31, 2024, 172 of the 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft (to be purchased under the 2014 contract) had been delivered. The remaining aircraft are expected to be delivered before March 2026.&nbsp; In May 2023, 300 new Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft orders were placed for delivery between 2027 and 2033. Ryanair expects these fuel-efficient MAX jets to generate substantial growth.</p><h2>Some Other Tailwinds Working in Favor of RYAAY Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">RYAAY has a solid balance sheet. The low-cost carrier ended third-quarter fiscal 2025 with cash and cash equivalents of $3.31 billion, much higher than the current debt level of $905 million. This implies that the company has sufficient cash to meet its current debt obligations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, long-term debt level has decreased to $1.79 billion at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2025 from $2.72 billion at third-quarter fiscal 2024-end. RYAAY&#39;s efforts to repay its debts are encouraging too.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Concurrent with the earnings announcement for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Dec. 31, 2024), RYAAY announced it is gearing up to repay a maturing &euro;850 million bond from internal cash resources in September 2025.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Long-Term Debt to Capitalization</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/81/94587.jpg?v=1720248919" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A strong balance sheet enables the company to reward shareholders with dividends and share repurchases. A final dividend of &euro;0.178 per share was paid in September 2024, and an interim dividend of &euro;0.223 per share will be paid on Feb. 26, 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">RYAAY is also active on the share buyback front. Restarted in May 2024, RYAAY bought back &euro;700 million worth of shares by August 2024. Concurrent with RYAAY&rsquo;s earnings announcement for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Dec. 31, 2024), RYAAY announced that it has completed more than 50% of its current &euro;800m buyback program and is on track to complete this program by mid-2025. On completion, Ryanair will have returned almost &euro;9 billion (including dividends) to shareholders since 2008, with approximately 36% of the issued share capital repurchased and canceled.</p><h2>Impressive Valuation Picture for RYAAY Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">From a valuation perspective, RYAAY is trading at a discount compared to the industry, going by its enterprise value to its total sales ratio (trailing 12 months). The reading is also below its five-year median. The company has a Value Score of B.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fa/94586.jpg?v=801781453" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Risks Weighing on RYAAY Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Production delays at Boeing have been hurting the fleet-related plans of most airline companies, and it is no different for RYAAY. RYAAY is actively in talks with Boeing leadership to speed up aircraft deliveries and has also visited Seattle at the beginning of January. Although B737 production is recovering from Boeing&rsquo;s strike in late 2024, it is still slow to deliver sufficient aircraft ahead of the summer season of fiscal 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">RYAAY anticipates nine deliveries before the summer season of fiscal 2025, while the remaining 29 Gamechangers of the 210 orderbook are likely to be delivered before March 2026. Additionally, Boeing expects the MAX-10 to be certified in late 2025, followed by the delivery of the first 15 MAX-10s in spring 2027. Given that the risk of delivery delays persists, it has prompted Ryanair to lower its fiscal 2026 traffic growth target from an initial 215 million passengers to 210 million passengers, and now it has been reduced to 206 million passengers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Escalating operating expenses due to high staff costs and higher air traffic control fees are hurting Ryanair&rsquo;s bottom line. During the first nine months of fiscal 2025, staff costs increased 18% year over year due to the larger fleet, higher sectors and Boeing delivery delays (leading to higher crewing ratios, and the annualization of crew productivity pay increases). Airport and handling charges rose 13% year over year owing to traffic growth, higher landing, ground air traffic control and handling rates. As a result, total operating expenses rose 8% year over year during the first nine months of fiscal 2025. High costs naturally put pressure on margins.</p><h2>How Should Investors Approach RYAAY Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">It is understood that RYAAY stock is attractively valued, and upbeat passenger volumes are contributing to RYAAY&rsquo;s top line. RYAAY&rsquo;s measures to expand its fleet, to cater to the rising travel demand, look encouraging. A solid balance sheet allows RYAAY to reward its shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividend payments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the positives, we advise investors not to buy RYAAY now due to the production delays at Boeing which have been hurting the fleet-related plans of the company. Escalating operating expenses due to high staff costs and higher air traffic control fees are weighing on the bottom line. We advise investors to wait for a better entry point. For those who already own the stock, it will be prudent to stay invested. The company&rsquo;s current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) justifies our analysis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. </p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418993/ryanair-stock-plunges-19-7-in-a-year-should-you-buy-the-dip?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2418993">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>UiPath Inc. </strong>PATH stock has gained 17% over the past six months compared with the industry&#39;s impressive 76% rally. This analysis will explore PATH&#39;s performance to assess whether its current levels offer an attractive entry point for investors.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/62/94644.jpg?v=201674014" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>PATH Thrives in Automation Market Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">UiPath is a leader in the rapidly expanding Robotic Process Automation (RPA) market, which is expected to experience significant growth in the coming years. Its comprehensive automation platform positions it favorably to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven automation solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the tight competition, PATH continues to grow through strategic collaborations with a global network of partners, including industry leaders such as <strong>Microsoft</strong> MSFT, <strong>Amazon</strong> AMZN, AWS and <strong>Salesforce</strong> CRM. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, UiPath achieved a 9% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $355 million. The company&rsquo;s annual recurring revenues rose to $1.61 billion during the quarter, representing 17% growth compared to the previous year. This performance highlights its effectiveness in expanding subscription-based services and maintaining strong customer retention.</p><h2>PATH&#39;s Strong Financial Position</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">PATH boasts a robust financial position, highlighted by its strong balance sheet. As of the fiscal third quarter, the company held $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents, with no outstanding debt. This debt-free status ensures that its cash reserves are available to fuel growth initiatives and strategic investments. Such financial flexibility increases PATH&rsquo;s ability to drive innovation and expand its market presence without financial strain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the company&rsquo;s liquidity is robust. At the end of the fiscal third quarter, PATH reported a current ratio of 3.13, significantly exceeding the industry average of 2.21. A current ratio above 1 indicates that a company has sufficient assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The company&rsquo;s strong liquidity positions it to navigate economic uncertainties and enhances its capacity to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the competitive RPA market.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1a/94646.jpg?v=1053349728" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>PATH&rsquo;s Bottom-line Challenges</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">PATH&rsquo;s bottom line appears less optimistic. The company is expected to report earnings of 47 cents per share in fiscal 2025, reflecting a 13% decline year over year. This suggests potential profitability challenges. Moreover, fiscal 2026 earnings are expected to reach approximately 48 cents per share, translating to a modest 3.5% year-over-year increase. Such sluggish earnings growth indicates limited upside potential, especially if operating expenses remain high.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ab/94645.jpg?v=1503278593" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>PATH&rsquo;s Current Situation Supports a Hold Strategy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">PATH&rsquo;s performance merits a hold recommendation. While the stock has gained decently over the past six months, it lags behind the industry&rsquo;s impressive rally. The company demonstrates strength in the growing automation market through strategic collaborations and robust revenue and recurring revenue growth. Its strong balance sheet, liquidity, and debt-free status provide a solid foundation for future investments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, modest earnings growth and bottom-line challenges indicate caution. Investors should remain patient and monitor further developments, as potential risks may limit the upside. Holding PATH balances exposure to growth opportunities with measured risk management. Overall, investors should maintain a cautious approach.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PATH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ Extra Space Storage to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Extra Space Storage</strong> EXR, a leading self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) in the United States, is set to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results on Feb. 25, after market close. As the market anticipates the earnings announcement, this article provides an in-depth preview of EXR&rsquo;s expected performance in the fourth quarter, considering overall industry trends, the company&rsquo;s growth strategy and acquisitions.</p><p><em><strong>See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</strong></em></p><p>In the last reported quarter, this Salt Lake City, UT-based REIT delivered a surprise of 1.97% in terms of core FFO per share. The results reflected a rise in occupancy and better-than-anticipated revenues.</p><p>Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed in the remaining period, the average surprise being 1.25%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Extra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise</h2> <img alt="Extra Space Storage Inc Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/e4/1740068080.png" title="" width="538" /> <p>Extra Space Storage Inc price-eps-surprise | Extra Space Storage Inc Quote</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Factors to Consider Ahead of EXR&rsquo;s Results</h2><p>In the fourth quarter, Extra Space Storage is likely to have continued benefiting from its strong presence in key cities and efforts to expand through accretive acquisitions, mutually beneficial joint venture partnerships and third-party management services.</p><p>EXR&#39;s continued emphasis on enhancing the customer experience through technology integration and operational improvements is likely to have bolstered its competitive edge. Its strong brand reputation and technological advancements are expected to have supported performance during the quarter. This REIT is likely to have sustained a healthy balance sheet throughout the period.</p><p>However, the company continues to see new customer price sensitivity and is likely to face headwinds from lower new customer rates in the near term. As such, the reacceleration in revenue growth is expected to be challenging until the company regains pricing power with new customers.</p><p>Further, high interest expenses are expected to have cast a pall on the company&rsquo;s performance to some extent.</p><h2>Q4 Projections for EXR</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $702 million for quarterly property rental revenues suggests an increase from the year-ago period&rsquo;s $697 million. The consensus estimate for revenues from tenant insurance of $83.5 million implies an increase from $70.4 million in the year-ago period.</p><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $831.5 million for quarterly revenues suggests a 4.2% increase year over year.</p><p>However, the consensus mark for management and franchise fees for the quarter are projected at $30.1 million, down from $30.4 in the year-ago period.</p><p>Further, we estimate an 5.1% year-over-year increase in interest expenses in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Extra Space Storage&rsquo;s activities during the quarter were not adequate to gain analysts&rsquo; confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly core FFO per share has remained unrevised over the past month at $2.02. It also indicates no change compared to the year-over-year reported figure.</p><h2>EXR&rsquo;s 2024 Projections</h2><p>For 2024, Extra Space Storage expected core FFO per share in the range of $8.00-$8.15. The full-year guidance is based on the assumption of a decline of 0.25-0.50% year over year in same-store revenues and a 4.25-5.25% increase in same-store expenses. Consequently, same-store NOI growth is projected in the band of negative 2.25% to negative 0.50%.</p><p>For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for core FFO per share is currently pegged at $8.10. This indicates no change from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $3.28 billion, implying an increase of 28% from the year-ago reported number.</p><h2>What Our Quantitative Model Predicts for EXR</h2><p>Our proven model does not conclusively predict a likely surprise in terms of core FFO per share for Extra Space Storage this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.</p><p>Extra Space Storage currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><h2>Stocks That Warrant a Look</h2><p>Here are two stocks from the broader REIT sector &mdash; <strong>Gaming and Leisure Properties</strong> GLPI and <strong>Ryman Hospitality Properties</strong> RHP &mdash; that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.</p><p>Gaming and Leisure Properties, scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Feb. 20, has an Earnings ESP of +0.83% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p>Ryman Hospitality, scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Feb. 20, has an Earnings ESP of +4.91% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.</p><p>Note: <em>Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) &mdash; a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418989/extra-space-storage-to-post-q4-earnings-what-s-in-the-cards?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2418989">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated</strong> JLL reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $6.15, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.80. The reported figure increased from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s $5.36.</p><div><p><strong><em>See the Zacks </em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong><strong><em> to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><p>Results reflect better-than-anticipated revenues. The company benefited from an acceleration in transactional activity and sustained growth in resilient revenues. JLL also gained from its cost management efforts.</p></div><p>Revenues of $6.81 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.48 billion. The figure increased by 15.8% from the year-ago quarter.</p><p>Per Christian Ulbrich, CEO of JLL, &quot;Throughout 2024, our focus on operating efficiency helped drive significant margin expansion and free cash flow generation. Clients continue to look to JLL for innovative real estate management solutions, industry expertise and data-driven insights. With our strong momentum amidst an improving real estate cycle, JLL&rsquo;s talent and differentiated platform position us well to gain market share and drive profitable growth in 2025.&rdquo;</p><p>For the full year 2024, adjusted EPS was $14.01, higher than the prior-year tally of $10.39, while surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.64. This was backed by an 12.9% increase in revenues to $23.43 billion, while surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.11 billion.</p><h2>JLL&rsquo;s Segment-Wise Performance</h2><p>During the fourth quarter, the Markets Advisory segment&rsquo;s revenues came in at $1.33 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 10.9% (in USD). The rise was driven by Leasing, led by the office sector. Most geographies witnessed double-digit leasing revenue growth, particularly in the United States, India and Greater China.</p><p>Meanwhile, growth in Property Management revenues was driven by expansion in the United States and several countries in Asia Pacific, largely due to greater pass-through costs, as management fees were flat for the fourth quarter.</p><p>Revenues for the Capital Markets segment were $706.4 million, increasing 31.5% (in USD) year over year. The rise was led by Investment Sales and Debt/Equity Advisory, most notably in the United States and Asia Pacific across all asset classes, with residential and industrial leading the way. Investor sentiment and greater interest rate stability supported year-over-year accelerated activity.</p><p>JLL&rsquo;s Work Dynamics segment reported revenues of $4.56 billion, up 14.9% (in USD) year over year. The uptick in revenues was driven by continued strong performance in Workplace Management, largely from a balanced mix of client wins, mandate expansions and incremental pass-through costs in the United States. Project Management also delivered double-digit revenue growth across geographies, as higher pass-through costs resulted in management fee increases.</p><p>Revenues in the LaSalle segment increased 39.3% (in USD) year over year to $160.6 million. The rise in revenues was due to higher incentive fees on asset dispositions in Asia Pacific. It was partially offset by a decline in advisory fees reflecting reduced fees in Europe as a result of structural changes to a lower-margin business and declines in assets under management (AUM) over the last 12 months.</p><p>As of Dec. 31, 2024, LaSalle had $88.8 billion of AUM, down from $89 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023. This was due to modest valuation declines, as well as net dispositions and withdrawals.</p><p>However, the JLL Technologies segment reported revenues of $59.3 million, declining 9.5% (in USD) from the prior-year quarter levels. The fall was due to lower contract signings in technology solutions over the last 12 months, partially offset by modest growth in software services.</p><h2>JLL&rsquo;s Balance Sheet</h2><p>JLL exited the fourth quarter of 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $416.3 million, down from $437.8 million at the end of the third quarter.</p><p>As of Dec. 31, 2024, the net leverage ratio was 0.7, down from 1.7 as of Sept. 31, 2024. The corporate liquidity was $3.62 billion as of the fourth quarter&#39;s end, up from $3.39 billion as of the third quarter&rsquo;s end.</p><p>JLL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h2> <img alt="Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/87/1740067302.png" title="" width="579" /> <p>Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated Quote</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Performance of Other Broader Real Estate Market Stocks</h2><p><strong>CBRE Group Inc.</strong> CBRE reported fourth-quarter 2024 core EPS of $2.32, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21. The reported figure also increased 68.1% year over year.</p><p>Results reflected revenue growth in its resilient lines of business. The quarter marked the best quarter ever for core earnings and free cash flow with broad-based strength across its Advisory Services, Global Workplace Solutions and Real Estate Investments business segments. CBRE currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.</p><p><strong>Iron Mountain Incorporated</strong> IRM reported fourth-quarter adjusted funds from operations per share of $1.24, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20. This figure jumped 11.7% year over year.</p><p>Results reflected solid performances in the storage and service segments and the data center business. However, higher interest expenses in the quarter undermined the performance to an extent. The company issued its outlook for 2025 and raised its dividend by 10.6% from the prior payment. IRM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418988/jones-lang-s-q4-earnings-beat-estimates-revenues-rise-y-y?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418988">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

Total assets of $13.87 billion rose from $13.51 billion at 2023-end.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Debt was $7.46 billion, up from $7.08 billion at 2023-end. Blue Owl Capital had $2.6 billion of undrawn capacity under its credit facilities. At the fourth-quarter end, net debt to equity was 1.19X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Net operating cash flow in 2024 was $160.2 million, down from the prior-year figure of $1.14 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Dividend &amp; Repurchase Update</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The board of directors at Blue Owl Capital declared a first-quarter 2025 dividend of 37 cents per share, to be paid on or before April 15, 2025, to shareholders of record as of March 31. It also provided a fourth-quarter 2024 supplemental dividend of 5 cents per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Blue Owl Capital had the 2024 Stock Repurchase Program (expiring in 18 months from the approval date of May 6, 2024), under which the company may purchase shares up to $150 million. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company did not make share repurchases under this program in 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How Did Other Finance Stocks Perform?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some other stocks in the broader Finance space that have already reported earnings for this quarter: <strong>Capital One</strong> COF, <strong>Golub Capital BDC, Inc. </strong>GBDC and <strong>Ares Capital </strong><strong>Corporation </strong>ARCC.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Capital One&rsquo;s fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $3.09 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.66 thanks to higher net interest income and non-interest income and a rise in loans and deposits. Also, provisions declined during the quarter. However, the positives were partially offset by increased expenses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Golub Capital reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS of 39 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.3% and declined sequentially from 47 cents. Over the past four quarters, the company beat consensus EPS estimates just once. Total investment income in first-quarter fiscal 2025 of $220.7 million missed the consensus mark by 2.5%. The figure also fell sequentially from $224.4 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ares Capital&rsquo;s fourth-quarter 2024 core earnings of 55 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents due to an increase in expenses. However, an improvement in the total investment income and the company&rsquo;s robust portfolio activities supported the results to some extent.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418980/blue-owl-capital-s-q4-earnings-meet-estimates-top-line-falls-y-y?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418980">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.&#39;s (</strong>EXPD<strong>)</strong> board of directors has chosen its current president of Global Geographies, Daniel R. Wall, as the next president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, effective April 1, 2025. Wall will be appointed to the board and stand for election at the company&rsquo;s upcoming annual meeting of shareholders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Wall is succeeding Jeffrey S. Musser, EXPD&rsquo;s current president and CEO, who plans to step down from his role effective March 31, 2025. Post-retirement, Mr. Musser will step down from the company&rsquo;s board of directors as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bob Carlile, chairman of Expeditors&rsquo; board of directors, stated, &ldquo;Jeff has spent decades living and expressing the very best of the Expeditors culture, as has Dan. Both executives have excelled at every level within our organization, having distinguished themselves throughout long and meaningful careers with our company. Both started when they were young, and both have demonstrated the qualities of leadership necessary to continue to take our company to the next level of performance.&rdquo;</p><h2>Jeffrey S. Musser&rsquo;s Span in EXPD</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Jeffrey joined Expeditors at the very young age of 16. In his 42-year career, Jeff has grown through multiple roles. In 2014, he was promoted to the chief executive role, marking the third CEO in EXPD&rsquo;s history. He has supervised the company&rsquo;s growth from $6.1 billion revenues and 14,000 employees in 2013 to $10.6 billion revenues and more than 18,000 employees in 2024. During the same period, Expeditors rewarded its shareholders with $9.6 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases and increased earnings per share by 240%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Jeff has served EXPD as CEO for 11 years.</p><h2>Daniel R. Wall&rsquo;s Journey so Far in EXPD</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Daniel R. Wall joined Expeditors in March 1987. He was promoted to District Manager in May 1992 and Global Director &mdash; Account Management in March 2002. Wall was chosen vice president &mdash; ECMS (Order Management) in January 2004 and senior vice president &mdash; Ocean Services in September 2004. He was appointed as president of Global Products in June 2015 and as president of Global Services, effective Jan. 1, 2023. In October 2023, Wall was chosen as president of Global Geographies and Operations, effective Jan. 1, 2024. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Considering Wall&rsquo;s 38 years of professional journey with Expeditors and his proven leadership skills, his continuation in EXPD is expected to complement the company&rsquo;s operations and strengthen its competitive position in the industry.</p><h2>Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider</h2><p>EXPD currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector may also consider <strong>United Airlines</strong> UAL and <strong>SkyWest</strong> SKYW. Each stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">United Airlines has an expected earnings growth rate of 21.11% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL&rsquo;s 2025 earnings per share has been revised 10.6% upward in the past 60 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has an encouraging track record with respect to the earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters. The average beat is 22.93%. Shares of UAL have surged 161.2% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SkyWest</strong>, founded in 1972, is based in St. George and operates regional jets for major U.S. airlines. SKYW&rsquo;s track record of successfully meeting the requirements of each of its airline heavyweight partners bodes well for the company. Revenues from flying agreements (which account for the bulk of the top line) are impressive owing to SKYW&rsquo;s above ability. Owing to an uptick in air travel demand, passenger volumes have been upbeat and are likely to increase going forward as well. This is likely to keep SKYW&#39;s top line in good shape.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SKYW has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company&#39;s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 16.71%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings per share has been revised 7.9% upward in the past 60 days.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418981/expeditors-announces-new-president-and-chief-executive-officer?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_corporate_actions-2418981">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dell Technologies</strong> DELL is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Feb. 27.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar</strong></em>.<br /><br />Dell expects fourth-quarter revenues in the range of $24-$25 billion, with a midpoint of $24.5 billion, indicating 10% growth. Earnings are expected to be $2.50 per share (+/- 10 cents).<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $24.66 billion, suggesting 10.48% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />The consensus mark for quarterly earnings is pegged at $2.53 per share, up a couple of cents over the past 30 days, and suggesting year-over-year growth of 15%.<br />&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Dell Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Dell Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/16/1740065452.png" style="width: 620px; height: 262px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Dell Technologies Inc. price-eps-surprise | Dell Technologies Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p><p>Dell&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarter, with an earnings surprise of 10.44% on average.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s see how things have shaped up for DELL shares prior to this announcement.</p><h2>Key Factors to Note for DELL</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Sluggish PC shipments in the consumer segment are expected to have hurt DELL&rsquo;s top-line growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 amid continued consumer demand challenges and competitive pressures. Weak IT spending over storage is expected to have negatively impacted top-line growth.<br /><br />Per Gartner&rsquo;s latest report, DELL saw a 0.1% year-over-year decline in worldwide PC shipments in the fourth quarter of 2024. Dell Technologies&rsquo; market share declined 20 basis points (bps) to 15.5%. According to IDC&rsquo;s data, DELL lost 20 bps market share to 14.4% while shipments remained at 9.9 million units.<br /><br />Although Dell&rsquo;s fiscal fourth-quarter results are expected to have benefited from the robust demand for AI-optimized servers, guidance implied a sequential decline.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dell anticipates 13% year-over-year revenue growth at the midpoint for the combined Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) and Client Solutions Group (CSG). ISG revenues are expected to increase in the mid-twenties, while CSG revenues are expected to be up low single digits year over year.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the fiscal third quarter, ISG revenues jumped 33.8% year over year to $11.37 billion. DELL&rsquo;s current guidance implies slow growth from AI-related sales in the to-be-reported quarter.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DELL&rsquo;s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 ISG revenues is currently pegged at $11.713 billion, indicating 25.5% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for CSG is pegged at $12.074 billion, suggesting 3.1% year-over-year growth.</p><h2>DELL Shares Underperform Sector</h2><p>Year to date, Dell&rsquo;s shares have declined 0.7%, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector&rsquo;s return of 2.1%.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Year-to-Date Performance Chart</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/27/94633.jpg?v=947880868" /></p><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DELL stock is overvalued, as the Value Score of C suggests.</p><h2>Can Strong AI Demand Push the DELL Stock Higher?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Strong demand for AI servers, driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI (GenAI) applications, is a key catalyst. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, Dell Technologies shipped $2.9 billion of AI servers, and the AI server backlog was $4.5 billion, exiting the reported quarter.<br /><br />AI server pipeline is expanding across Tier-2 CSPs and enterprise customers. Dell expects strong top-line growth for the second half of fiscal 2025, driven by robust AI demand.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Dell AI Factory, which combines Dell Technologies&rsquo; solutions and services optimized for AI workloads and supports an open ecosystem of partners comprising <strong>NVIDIA</strong> NVDA, <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> META, <strong>Microsoft</strong> MSFT and Hugging Face, has been a game changer.<br /><br />DELL&rsquo;s end-to-end solutions portfolio supports long-term growth targets. It expects revenues to grow between 3% and 4% and earnings of more than 8%.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dell expects to return more than 80% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and a dividend growth rate of more than 10% during the 2024-2028 timeframe. Since the VMware spin-off, Dell has returned $5.5 billion to shareholders.</p><h2>What Should Investors Do With DELL Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Dell&rsquo;s robust portfolio and rich partner base are noteworthy. However, challenges in the PC market are a headwind in the near term. DELL&rsquo;s fiscal fourth-quarter guidance implies lower AI-related sales. This, along with growing risks related to tariffs, is a concern for investors. A stretched valuation is a headwind.<br /><br />Technically, DELL shares are trading below the 200-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">DELL Shares Trade Below 200-Day SMA</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3a/94635.jpg?v=250038545" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DELL currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), suggesting that it may be wise to avoid the stock ahead of fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results.&nbsp;<br /><br />You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418978/buy-sell-or-hold-dell-stock-key-tips-ahead-of-q4-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2418978">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

Both top and bottom lines increased from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s figures.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar</strong></em>.<br /><br />Cheesecake Factory wrapped up a strong 2024, delivering record annual revenues and improved profitability, supported by solid top-line growth and earnings. The company&rsquo;s success was primarily fueled by robust performance at its flagship Cheesecake Factory restaurants, which continued to outpace the broader casual dining industry in comparable sales and traffic. Management highlighted strong consumer demand across CAKE&rsquo;s portfolio, reinforcing confidence in the long-term growth potential of its brands.</p><h2>CAKE&rsquo;s Earnings &amp; Revenue Discussion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the quarter under review, the company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents by 13%. In the year-ago period, the company reported adjusted EPS of 80 cents.<br /><br />Quarterly revenues of $921 million beat the consensus estimate of $912 million by 1%.

We predicted comps to increase 1% year over year.<br /><br />North Italia comps rose 1% year over year compared with 7% growth reported in the year-ago quarter. Our model expected the metric to rise 2.3% year over year.</p><h2>CAKE&rsquo;s Costs in Detail</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The cost of food and beverage, as a percentage of revenues, contracted 70 basis points (bps) year over year to 22.3% in the fiscal fourth quarter. We expected the metric to be 22.7% of revenues in the quarter.<br /><br />Labor expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, amounted to 34.2%, down 100 bps year over year. We expected the metric to be 35.5% of revenues in the quarter.<br /><br />Other operating costs, as a percentage of total revenues, were 26.8%, flat year over year. In the quarter, we anticipated the metric to be 26.2% of revenues.<br /><br />General and administrative expenses accounted for 6.3% of revenues, up 10 bps year over year. Our model predicted the metric to be 6.4% of revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter.<br /><br />In the fiscal fourth quarter, pre-opening expenses accounted for 0.8% of revenues, up 30 bps year over year.</p><h2>Balance Sheet of CAKE</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31., 2024, Cheesecake Factory&rsquo;s cash and cash equivalents totaled $84.2 million compared with $56.3 million as of Jan. 2, 2024.

The dividend will be payable on March 18, to its shareholders of record as of March 5, 2025. In the fiscal fourth quarter, CAKE repurchased approximately 11,800 shares for $0.5 million.</p><h2>CAKE&rsquo;s Store Developments</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the company expanded its footprint with nine new restaurant openings, including three North Italia locations, two Flower Child locations, two FRC restaurants and the relocation of two Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Following the quarter&#39;s end, five additional restaurants were opened, consisting of one North Italia location, two Flower Child locations and two FRC restaurants.<br /><br />In 2025, the company anticipates accelerating growth by adding up to 25 restaurants across its portfolio.</p><h2>CAKE&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Restaurant Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Cheesecake Factory currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Global system-wide sales rose 5.6% year over year. QSR unveiled its long-term consolidated performance expectations from 2024 to 2028.

Both top and bottom lines decreased year over year. Its Accelerating-the-Arches strategy remains the right approach for expanding market share.<br /><br />At company-operated restaurants, sales were $2.31 billion, down 7% year over year. Sales at franchise-operated restaurants amounted to $3.95 billion, which increased 2% year over year. The global comps increased 0.4% compared with 3.4% growth in the prior-year quarter. MCD&rsquo;s comps increased after witnessing a decline in the preceding two quarters.<br /><br /><strong>YUM! Brands, Inc.</strong> YUM reported fourth-quarter 2024 results, with adjusted earnings and total revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s top-line performance reflected solid contributions from the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell divisions. YUM reported progress in the digital space, with digital sales rising approximately 15% and the digital mix surpassing 50%, moving closer to its long-term goal of 100% digital sales. Worldwide system sales, excluding foreign currency translation, grew 8% year over year, with Taco Bell increasing 14% and KFC rising 6%.

Quote</p></div><h2>More on PWR&rsquo;s Q4 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Quanta&rsquo;s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.94 topped the consensus estimate of $2.64 by 11.4% and increased 44.1% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s $2.04.<br /><br />Total revenues of $6.55 billion missed the consensus mark of $6.63 billion by 1.2% but increased 13.3% year over year. The surge in revenue and earnings was primarily fueled by increasing demand for infrastructure solutions, particularly in the power and renewable energy sectors. Quanta benefited from continued investments in electric grid modernization, renewable energy projects, and underground utility expansion.<br /><br />The operating margin for the quarter expanded 130 basis points (bps) to 6.9% from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA of $737.8 million improved 34.1% from the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />The company reported a 12-month backlog of $19.77 billion and a total backlog of $34.54 billion at the end of 2024. This compares with the December 2023-end 12-month backlog of $17.23 billion and the total backlog of $30.11 billion.</p><h2>PWR&rsquo;s Segment Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reports results under three segments &mdash; Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions, Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions, and Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions.<br /><br />Revenues from <strong>Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions</strong> totaled $3.41 billion, which grew 38.6% year over year. The reported figure came ahead of our expectation of $3.3 billion for the quarter. The operating margin jumped 260 bps to 13.1% (above our projection of 11.1%) in the quarter from a year ago. The segment&rsquo;s 12-month backlog was $10.16 billion, up from $8.36 billion in 2023. The total backlog was $19.90 billion compared with $15.5 billion at 2023-end.<br /><br />Revenues from <strong>Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions </strong>totaled $1.98 billion (below our expectation of $2.21 billion), down 2.5% year over year. Yet, operating margins expanded 160 bps from the year-ago level to 10.5% (below our projection of 11%). The segment&rsquo;s 12-month backlog was $6.34 billion, up from $5.63 billion at 2023-end. The total backlog of $8.72 billion increased from $8.13 billion at 2023-end.<br /><br />Within the <strong>Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions</strong> segment, revenues declined 9.9% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s levels to $1.17 billion (above our expectation of $1.08 billion). The operating margin of 3.6% was down 300 bps from the prior-year quarter. We had projected the metric to be 5.7% for the quarter. The segment&rsquo;s 12-month backlog totaled $3.28 billion, up from $3.24 billion at 2023-end. The total backlog decreased to $5.91 billion from $6.48 billion at 2023-end.</p><h2>Quanta&rsquo;s 2024 Highlights</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted EPS came in at $8.97, up 25.3% from $7.16 a year ago. Total revenues were $23.67 billion, up from $20.88 billion in 2023. Operating margin expanded 30 bps to 5.7% in 2024.</p><h2>Quanta&rsquo;s Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, Quanta had cash and cash equivalents of $742 million, down from $1.29 billion at 2023-end. The company&rsquo;s long-term debt (net of current maturities) amounted to $4.1 billion, up from $3.66 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023.<br /><br />Net cash provided by operating activities was $712 million in the fourth quarter, down from $1 billion a year ago. Operating cash flow was $2.08 billion, up from $1.58 billion a year ago. Free cash flow in the quarter was $575.4 million (down from $915.5 million a year ago), and in 2024, it was $1.55 billion (up from $1.21 billion in 2023).<br /><br />Furthermore, Quanta is optimizing its capital deployment strategy, with $500 million remaining under its stock repurchase program and an 11% increase in its quarterly dividend, reinforcing its commitment to returning value to shareholders.</p><h2>What PWR Expects for 2025</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Quanta expects revenues between $26.6 billion and $27.1 billion. The company reported revenues of $23.67 billion in 2024.<br /><br />The company expects adjusted EPS in the range of $9.90-$10.50, resenting an increase from $8.97 in 2024. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $2.66 and $2.80 billion compared with $2.33 billion in 2024.<br /><br />Quanta expects 2025 operating cash flow between $1.70 billion and $2.25 billion and free cash flow between $1.20 billion and $1.70 billion.</p><h2>PWR&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Quanta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Fluor Corporation</strong> FLR reported lower-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2024. Earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined from the prior year due to a sharp drop in Urban Solutions&#39; margin despite higher revenues. Revenues also missed the consensus mark but increased from the previous year. The company&#39;s top line grew year over year on the back of solid contributions from the Urban Solutions and Energy Solutions business segments.<br /><br />For 2025, Fluor expects adjusted EPS in the range of $2.25-$2.75. The full-year revenues are expected to grow approximately 15% year over year.<br /><br /><strong>Masco Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s MAS fourth-quarter 2024 earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Earnings topped expectations in six of the trailing seven quarters. On the other hand, net sales missed the consensus mark and tumbled year over year.<br /><br />Masco&rsquo;s fourth-quarter top line reflected lower sales volume for North America&rsquo;s plumbing products, lower net selling prices of decorative architectural products and an unfavorable sales mix of plumbing products. However, the bottom line was favored by lower selling, general and administrative expenses, favorable net selling prices and strategic cost savings initiatives. Moving into 2025, the company aims to continue maintaining shareholder value through its top-tier repair and remodel-oriented product portfolio, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation.<br /><br /><strong>UFP Industries, Inc.</strong> UFPI reported mixed fourth-quarter 2024 results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but revenues beat the same. Both metrics declined year over year.<br /><br />UFP Industries&rsquo; quarterly results were affected by softer demand and broad-based pricing pressures. While economic challenges are expected to persist in 2025, the company remains confident that its balanced business model, variable incentive-compensation structure and ongoing growth initiatives will support continued success.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418970/quanta-beats-q4-earnings-estimates-eyes-solid-2025-growth?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418970">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Walmart Inc. </strong>WMT posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results, with the top and bottom lines increasing year over year and cruising past their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company experienced growth across all business segments, expanding e-commerce, increasing pickup options and accelerating delivery services. Newer ventures like the marketplace, advertising and membership have contributed to diversified profits, reinforcing the resilience of Walmart&rsquo;s business model. The company also hiked its annual dividend rate.<br /><br />Walmart&rsquo;s adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share jumped 10% from the year-ago period&rsquo;s figure of 60 cents. The metric came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em><br /><br />Total revenues grew 4.1% year over year to $180.6 billion, which beat the consensus mark of $180 billion. However, revenues included an adverse currency impact of $2.1 billion. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, total revenues climbed 5.3%. Revenues were backed by strength across all operating segments.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Walmart Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h2> <img alt="Walmart Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="266" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/33/1740063205.png" title="" width="573" /> <p>Walmart Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Walmart Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Walmart&rsquo;s Quarterly Metrics: Key Insights</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Walmart&rsquo;s Global e-commerce sales surged 16% as penetration increased across all segments. The upside can be attributed to store-fulfilled pickup and delivery services, along with growth in the U.S. marketplace. However, growth was impacted by the timing of Flipkart&rsquo;s Big Billion Days (BBD) sales event. The company witnessed a 16% increase in global membership income. WMT&rsquo;s global advertising business advanced 29%.<br /><br />The consolidated gross profit margin expanded 53 basis points (bps) to 23.9%, driven by Walmart U.S. Margin growth. The upside was backed by effective inventory management and reduced markdowns, allowing for strategic pricing to maintain competitive price gaps, along with an improved business mix. However, this was partially offset by challenges from the merchandise mix. In addition, margins were positively impacted by the timing shift of Flipkart&#39;s Big Billion Days sales event.<br /><br />Operating expenses deleveraged 46 bps, mainly due to higher variable pay from surpassing planned performance, as well as rising utilities and marketing costs. In addition, expenses were impacted by costs associated with the VIZIO acquisition.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s operating income increased 8.3% year over year to $7.9 billion driven by solid sales growth, a greater gross margin and higher membership income, partly negated by expense deleverage. The metric also saw benefits from improved economics in e-commerce.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Decoding Walmart&rsquo;s Segmental Show</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Walmart U.S.</strong>: The segment&rsquo;s net sales grew 5% year over year to $123.5 billion. U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, improved 4.6% due to transaction growth of 2.8% and an average ticket increase of 1.8%. Sales growth was backed by broad-based strength with solid seasonal performance despite a shortened holiday shopping season. WMT witnessed solid transaction counts and unit volumes, with continued share gains fueled by upper-income households. E-commerce sales in the segment rose 20%, driven by store-fulfilled pickup &amp; delivery and growth in the marketplace as well as in the company&rsquo;s Connect advertising.<br /><br />As of the fiscal fourth quarter, Walmart U.S. had nearly 4,600 pickup locations and about 4,500 delivery stores. The company remodeled about 100 stores during the reported quarter. The operating income of the Walmart U.S. segment jumped 7.4% to $6.5 billion.<br /><br /><strong>Walmart International</strong>: The segment&rsquo;s net sales inched down 0.7% to $32.2 billion, including currency headwinds of $2 billion. On a cc basis, net sales jumped 5.7%, driven by Walmex, China and Canada. The company saw successful festive events in markets with solid general merchandise growth.<br /><br />E-commerce sales went up 4% in the segment, reflecting the impact of the timing of Flipkart&#39;s BBD. The company&rsquo;s membership income grew more than 20%. The operating income, on a cc basis, grew 10.1% to $1.6 billion.<br /><br /><strong>Sam&rsquo;s Club U.S.</strong>: The segment, which comprises membership warehouse clubs, witnessed a net sales increase of 7.1% to $23.1 billion (excluding fuel). Sam&rsquo;s Club&rsquo;s comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 6.8%. While transactions grew 5.4%, the average ticket climbed 1.3%. The company saw strong performance in food and health &amp; wellness, along with share gains in grocery and general merchandise categories, including apparel and consumer electronics.<br /><br />E-commerce net sales jumped 24% at Sam&rsquo;s Club U.S., backed by momentum in delivery from the club, with digital penetration at an all-time high. The segment&rsquo;s operating income totaled $574 million, down 7.4% year over year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">WMT Stock: Other Updates &amp; Developments</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Walmart ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $9 billion and total debt of $45.8 billion.<br /><br />For fiscal 2025, WMT generated an operating cash flow of $36.4 billion and a free cash flow of $12.7 billion. In fiscal 2026, capital expenditures are likely to account for nearly 3-3.5% of net sales.<br /><br />During the quarter, Walmart&rsquo;s share repurchases amounted to $1.4 billion, representing 15.9 million shares. The remaining share repurchase authorization stands at $12 billion.&nbsp;<br /><br />The company announced a 13% increase in its annual dividend for fiscal 2026, raising it to 94 cents per share.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7f/94626.jpg?v=1240204038" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What to Expect From WMT in Fiscal 2026?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, WMT expects consolidated net sales growth of 3-4% (at cc).

Walmart expects adjusted EPS for fiscal 2026 to be in the $2.50-$2.60 range. The company recorded an adjusted EPS of $2.51 in fiscal 2025.<br /><br />Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 17.7% in the past three months compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 17%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks Looking Red Hot</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks are <strong>Boot Barn Holdings, Inc.</strong> BOOT, <strong>Deckers Outdoor Corporation</strong> DECK and <strong>lululemon athletica inc. </strong>LULU.<br /><br />Boot Barn is a specialty retailer of premium, high-quality casual apparel.

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. </strong>PEG is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2024 earnings on Feb. 25, before market open.<br /><br /><strong><em>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.</em></strong><br /><br />This utility company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.10% in the last reported quarter. The company&rsquo;s trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise is 0.38%, on average.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s discuss the factors that are likely to affect the upcoming quarterly results.</p><h2>Factors to Consider Ahead of PEG&rsquo;s Results</h2><p>Public Service Enterprise&rsquo;s service territories witnessed above-normal weather patterns for the majority of the fourth quarter, though some of its territories witnessed below-normal weather patterns in December. The warmer-than-normal weather condition is likely to have hurt electricity demand from PEG&rsquo;s customers for heating purposes this winter, while the below-normal temperature is expected to have boosted the demand to some extent. So, the overall impact of weather is expected to have been majorly unfavorable to the company&rsquo;s top-line performance.<br /><br />Nevertheless, load growth in its service areas, driven by data center expansion and favorable rate outcomes witnessed in prior quarters, is likely to have added an impetus to the company&rsquo;s revenue growth.<br /><br />Profitable returns from its prior capital investment in infrastructural upgrades and growth in rate base from higher regulated investments are likely to have boosted PEG&rsquo;s overall quarterly earnings.<br /><br />However, higher interest expenses, along with increasing operating and maintenance expenses on account of higher cyber and IT spending, are likely to have hurt the company&rsquo;s bottom-line performance to some extent.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise" height="320" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/bb/1740056569.png" title="" width="620" /> <p>Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Quote</p></div><h2>PEG&rsquo;s Q4 Expectation</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PEG&rsquo;s sales is pegged at $2.31 billion, which indicates a year-over-year decline of 11.2%.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 83 cents per share, which indicates year-over-year growth of 53.7%.</p><h2>What Our Model Predicts for PEG</h2><p>Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PEG this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here, as you will see below.<br /><br /><strong>Earnings ESP</strong>: The company&rsquo;s Earnings ESP is -1.01%. You can uncover the best stocks before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank</strong>: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see <strong>the complete list of Zacks Rank #1 stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Recent Utility Releases</h2><p><strong>NextEra Energy, Inc. </strong>NEE reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of 53 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents by 3.9%. The company reported operating revenues of $5.38 billion, which lagged the consensus estimate of $6.49 billion by 17%.<br /><br /><strong>WEC Energy Group </strong>WEC reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings of $1.43 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 by 0.7%. The company reported operating revenues of $2.28 billion, which missed the consensus estimate of $2.6 billion by 12.1%.<br /><br /><strong>National Fuel Gas Company</strong> NFG reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted operating earnings of $1.66 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 by 5.7%. The company reported sales of $549.5 million, which missed the consensus estimate of $594 million by 7.5%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418947/public-service-enterprise-set-to-report-q4-earnings-what-to-expect?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2418947">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Builders FirstSource, Inc. </strong>BLDR reported mixed results for the fourth quarter of 2024, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but net sales missing the same.<br /><br /><strong><em>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.</em></strong><br /><br />Both metrics declined year over year, owing to lower core organic sales and commodity deflation, partially offset by growth from acquisitions and one additional selling day. Margins also declined due to ongoing Single-Family and Multi-Family margin normalization.<br /><br />Shares of this manufacturer and supplier of building materials inched down 4.7% in today&rsquo;s pre-market trading session.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the company remained resilient in a challenging environment, maintaining a mid-teens EBITDA margin in 2024. Strategic initiatives and an efficient operating model supported performance. Going forward, it aims to enhance operational efficiency through investments in value-added solutions, installation services and advanced technology. A focus on organic growth and acquisitions positions the company for sustained performance across varying market conditions.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BLDR&rsquo;s Earnings &amp; Revenue Discussion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.31, which surpassed the consensus mark of $2.24 by 3.1%. However, the reported figure decreased 34.9% from the year-ago quarter, owing to lower adjusted net income, partially offset by share repurchases.<br /><br />Net sales of $3.82 billion missed the consensus mark of $3.91 billion by 2.4% and fell 8% on a year-over-year basis. Core organic sales declined 8.8% from the prior-year quarter. A commodity price deflation of 3.1% of net sales and softness in Multi-Family were partially offset by 2.5% growth from acquisitions and one additional selling day contribution of 1.4%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Builders FirstSource, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Builders FirstSource, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/c6/1740062909.png" title="" width="579" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Builders FirstSource, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Builders FirstSource, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Core organic growth in Single-Family decreased 6.8% and Multi-Family plunged 29.1%, while Repair and Remodel (R&amp;R)/Other increased 0.1%. Multi-Family and Single-Family lowered net sales by 4.1% and 4.7%, respectively, while R&amp;R/Other remained unchanged.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BLDR&rsquo;s Sales According to Product Category</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Value-Added Product Sales:</strong> For the reported quarter, sales of value-added products (comprising 49.7% of the quarterly net sales) were $1.9 billion, down 12% from the prior year.

As a percentage of net sales, adjusted SG&amp;A expenses increased 80 bps to 24.3%.<br /><br />Adjusted EBITDA fell 28% on a year-over-year basis to $493.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin also contracted 360 bps year over year to 12.9%, owing to lower gross profit margins, partially offset by lower operating leverage.<br /><br />BLDR delivered approximately $13 million in productivity savings, related to operational excellence and supply-chain initiatives.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BLDR&rsquo;s 2024 Highlights</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">BLDR generated net sales of $16.4 billion, down 4.1% from 2023, due to a decline in core organic net sales of 5.1% and commodity deflation of 1.8%. Nonetheless, acquisitions and the benefits from two additional selling days contributed 2.1% and 0.7%, respectively, to net sales.<br /><br />Adjusted EPS of $11.56 decreased 20.8% from $14.59 reported in 2023. Gross margin of 32.8% contracted 240 bps year over year. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 19.6% to $2.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 280 bps from 2023 to 14.2%.<br /><br />In 2024, BLDR delivered approximately $117 million in productivity savings related to operations excellence and supply-chain initiatives.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Financial Details of BLDR</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, Builders FirstSource had cash and cash equivalents of $153.6 million, up from $66.2 million at 2023-end. The company had liquidity of $1.8 billion at 2024-end, including $1.6 billion in net borrowing available under the revolving credit facility.<br /><br />Long-term debt, net of current portion, discounts and issuance costs, was $3.7 billion, up from $3.18 billion at 2023-end. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.5x compared with 1.1x in the prior year.<br /><br />Net cash from operations was $1.9 billion during the year compared with $2.3 billion a year ago. Free cash flow was $1.5 billion in 2024.<br /><br />BLDR repurchased 8.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $170.74 per share for $1.5 billion. The company has approximately $500 million remaining in its $1 billion share repurchase authorization announced in August 2024.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BLDR&rsquo;s 2025 Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2025, BLDR expects net sales between $16.5 billion and $17.5 billion. Acquisitions completed within the last 12 months are expected to contribute 4-4.5% in net sales growth. However, a fewer selling day in 2025 is expected to reduce net sales by 0.4%.<br /><br />Geographically, Single-Family starts are expected to be flat (down low-single digits to up low-single digits). Multi-Family starts are expected to be down mid-teens and R&amp;R activity is anticipated to remain up low-single digits compared with the previous year.<br /><br />Gross margin is likely to be in the range of 30-32%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 11.5-13%.

Depreciation and amortization expenses are estimated to be between $550 million and $600 million.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BLDR&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Retail-Wholesale Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Builders FirstSource currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Restaurant Brands International, Inc. </strong>QSR reported fourth-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Boston Scientific Corporation </strong>BSX, despite industrywide macroeconomic upheavals, &nbsp;has been seeing strong growth momentum across its target markets. Earlier this month, the company posted robust fourth-quarter 2024 results, surpassing market expectations and setting a positive outlook for 2025. These have led to upward revisions in analyst estimates.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2025 earnings per share has been revised upward by 3 cents over the past 60 days, with six analysts upgrading their estimates and no movement in the opposite direction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2025, the consensus mark for earnings per share has moved 3% north in the same time frame following 11 upward estimate revisions. The favorable estimate revisions indicate brokers&rsquo; confidence in the stock.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/e0/94636.jpg?v=915541780" style="height: 310px; width: 600px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Favorable Share Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Feb. 20, 2025, Boston Scientific&#39;s stock is trading at $105.67, reflecting a year-to-date increase of 18.9%. This compares favorably with the Zacks Medical Products industry&rsquo;s 9.5% growth and the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 4.2% rise. During this period, the Medical sector has risen 4.7%. Despite the challenges within the medical device space, the company has done well, banking on its above-market performances in the fourth quarter of 2024 across several of its core segments, fueled by innovation, clinical evidence generation and strong marketing strategies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Notably, BSX has also outperformed its direct peers and MedTech behemoths like <strong>Abbott </strong>ABT, <strong>Medtronic </strong>MDT and <strong>Becton Dickinson and Company</strong> or <strong>BD</strong> BDX year to date. During the said time frame, ABT has gained 17.4%, MDT has risen 8.9% and BDX has edged up 0.3%.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">YTD Share Price Comparison</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c2/94637.jpg?v=506717096" style="height: 310px; width: 600px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>BSX Ahead of Moving Averages Too</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Going by the technical indicators, the stock is trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating robust upward momentum and price stability. In fact, since Nov. 25, 2022, its 50-day moving average has been ahead of the 200-day moving average. This technical strength reflects the market&rsquo;s confidence in Boston Scientific&rsquo;s financial health and fundamentals. This can be good news for BSX investors, signaling &ldquo;support&rdquo; for a further uptrend.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">50 &amp; 200 Day SMAs</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/bd/94638.jpg?v=785302665" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Q4 Takeaways</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite macroeconomic headwinds in the form of rising inflationary pressure and supply issues, Boston Scientific continued its strong momentum, backed by innovation<strong>, </strong>strategic acquisitions and expanding market presence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The emerging market registered sturdy growth, primarily banking on continued broad-based momentum across the company&rsquo;s business and investment in this region. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Boston Scientific has been successfully expanding its base banking on its diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Asia Pacific (APAC), Boston Scientific registered strong growth in China, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand and grew 12% operationally in the fourth quarter despite recent volume-based procurement (VBP) implementations. In Japan, strong contributions from AGENT DCB, Rezum, WATCHMAN FLEX Pro and a very early contribution from FARAPULSE drove growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company recognized strong worldwide demand for its MedSurg and Cardiovascular lines, traction in the United States and outside for its next-generation WATCHMAN FLX and FLX Pro, as well as contribution from accretive acquisitions like Silk Road, Axonics and Cortex.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Promising Outlook Drives Investors&#39; Confidence</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Boston Scientific expects organic revenue growth of 14% to 16% in the first quarter and 10% to 12% for full-year 2025, driven by its expanding portfolio and the global execution of strategies. The company forecasts first-quarter adjusted EPS between 66 cents and 68 cents. Full-year EPS is projected in the range of $2.80-$2.87, implying 12% to 14% growth over 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Operational revenues are set to rise 18% to 20% in the first quarter, factoring in contributions from recent acquisitions. Despite minor headwinds from foreign exchange and tariffs, Boston Scientific anticipates 50 to 75 basis points in adjusted operating margin expansion. With a forecasted 12.5% adjusted tax rate and a manageable tariff impact, the company remains confident about sustaining differentiated financial performance throughout 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Pain and Brain franchises are particularly expected to gain solid traction in 2025 due to the strong execution of core growth strategies. The Electrophysiology arm is expected to gain momentum on the sustained adoption of FARAPULSE PFA.</p><h2>Strong Price Upside</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Based on short-term price targets by 27 analysts, Boston Scientific&#39;s average target price is $117.63, reflecting a 10.83%potential upside from its last closing price of $106.14.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fb/94639.jpg?v=1858536206" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Why BSX is a Buy Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Boston Scientific delivered a strong fourth-quarter 2024 performance and issued a bullish 2025 guidance, signaling continued growth. The company continues to outperform its peers in a challenging market for medical devices, driven by its continued efforts to optimize business to achieve sustainable profitability and stable liquidity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strong international sales, strategic acquisitions and expansion in emerging markets drive long-term potential despite economic uncertainties. We expect the company to gradually reduce the cost of manufacturing products and improve the margin scenario, benefiting from the easing monetary policy. With an average price target of $117.63, analysts see a strong upside potential, reinforcing this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock&rsquo;s attractiveness.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418946/boston-scientific-expects-strong-gains-in-2025-time-to-buy-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2418946">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Manulife Financial Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Dividend Raised ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 16:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Manulife Financial Corporation </strong>MFC delivered fourth-quarter 2024 core earnings of 74 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.4%. The bottom line improved 8.8% year over year.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em><strong>See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</strong></em><br /><br />Core earnings of $1.4 billion (C$1.9 billion) were up 6% year over year. The results reflected strong business growth led by Global WAM, Canada and Asia.<br /><br />New business value (NBV) in the reported quarter was $601 million (C$842 million), up 31% year over year, attributable to higher sales volumes in Asia, Canada and U.S. divisions. New business contractual service margin (&ldquo;CSM&rdquo;) of $60 million (C$842 million) rose 32% year over year.<br /><br />Annualized premium equivalent (APE) sales increased 42% year over year, attributable to higher sales in Asia and the U.S. division.<br /><br />Wealth and asset management assets under management and administration were $705.6 billion (C$1015 billion), up 21% year over year. The Wealth and Asset Management business generated net inflows of $0.8 billion (C$1.2 billion) against net outflows of $1.3 billion in the year-ago quarter, driven by continued strong retail net flows across all geographies.<br />&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Manulife Financial Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Manulife Financial Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/09/1740065806.png" title="" width="568" /> <p>Manulife Financial Corp price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Manulife Financial Corp Quote</p></div><p>Core return on equity, measuring the company&rsquo;s profitability, expanded 50 basis points year over year to 16.4%. Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test ratio was 137% as of Dec. 31, 2024, which remained unchanged from Dec. 31, 2023. Adjusted book value per common share was $37.02, up 15% year over year.</p><h2>Segmental Performance</h2><p><strong>Global Wealth and Asset Management</strong>&rsquo;s core earnings came in at $343 million (C$481 million), up 34% year over year, primarily driven by higher net fee income from favorable market impacts and positive net flows.<br /><br /><strong>Asia </strong>division&rsquo;s core earnings totaled $341 million (C$477 million), up 16% year over year, reflecting continued business growth momentum and impacts from the annual updates to actuarial methods and assumptions. Asia generated 63%, 38% and 37% year-over-year growth in APE sales, new business CSM and NBV, respectively, driven by broad-based growth across Asia.<br /><br />Manulife Financial&rsquo;s <strong>Canada </strong>division core earnings of $278 million (C$390 million) were up 11% year over year, driven by a more favorable insurance experience overall and business growth in Group Insurance.<br />APE sales and NBV were up 4% and 21%, respectively, while new business CSM increased 66%, reflecting strong sales growth in participating life insurance and segregated fund products. Lower Group Insurance sales modestly impacted overall growth in APE sales and NBV.&nbsp;<br /><br />The <strong>U.S.</strong> division reported core earnings of $210 million (C$294 million), down 16% year over year on lower investment spreads, impacts from the previously completed reinsurance transaction and the annual review of actuarial methods and assumptions.&nbsp;<br /><br />APE sales and NBV increased 7% and 17%, respectively, driven by increased demand from affluent customers for accumulation insurance products. New business CSM decreased 5% due to change in product mix and the impact of interest rates, partially offset by higher sales volumes.</p><h2>Dividend Update</h2><p>The board of directors approved a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 44 cents. Shareholders of record as of March 5 will receive the dividend on March 19.</p><h2>MFC&rsquo;s Zacks Rank</h2><p>MFC currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><h2>Performance of Other Insurers</h2><p><strong>Voya Financial, Inc</strong>. VOYA reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted operating earnings of $1.50 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 111.3%. The bottom line decreased 23.8% year over year. The decline was due to higher loss ratios in Stop Loss in Health Solutions and lower spread-based assets in Wealth Solutions. It was partially offset by growth in fee-based revenues in Wealth Solutions and Investment Management, as well as higher alternative investment income.<br /><br />Adjusted operating revenues amounted to $1.9 billion, which increased 12.5% year over year.&nbsp; As of Dec. 31, 2024, VOYA&rsquo;s assets under management and assets under administration and advisement totaled $893.5 million.<br /><br /><strong>Unum Group</strong>&rsquo;s UNM fourth-quarter 2024 operating net income of $2.03 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.7%. The bottom line increased 13.4% year over year. Total operating revenues of Unum Group were $3.2 billion, up 2.5% year over year, driven by higher premium income, other income and improved net investment income. The top line missed the consensus estimate by 1.5%.<br /><br />Premium increased 3.1% from the prior-year quarter to $2.6 billion, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. UNM expects after-tax adjusted operating income per share to grow 8-12% in 2025. Core operations premium growth is expected between 4% and 7%.<br /><br /><strong>Lincoln National Corporation </strong>LNC reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $1.91, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.8%. The bottom line advanced nearly 30% year over year. Adjusted operating revenues were $4.6 billion, which more than doubled year over year. However, the top line fell short of the consensus mark by 1%.<br /><br />LNC&rsquo;s estimated RBC ratio rose to more than 430% at fourth-quarter end. Insurance premiums totaled $1.59 billion, while the metric was recorded at a negative figure of $1.1 billion. However, the figure was lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 billion.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418930/manulife-financial-q4-earnings-beat-estimates-dividend-raised?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418930">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 5 Multiline Insurers to Watch as Competition Rises, Pricing Moderates ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ Product diversification has been helping Zacks Multiline Insurance industry players lower concentration risk, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit <strong>MetLife Inc</strong>. MET, <strong>American International Group Inc</strong>. AIG, <strong>Prudential Financial Inc</strong>. PRU, <strong>Radian Group </strong>RDN and <strong>CNO Financial Group </strong>CNO. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry. Increasing acceptance of embedded insurance should also drive the industry. Per a report in Financial Services, premiums from embedded insurance are projected to exceed $722 billion globally by 2030.<br /><br />The solid capital level of multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. However, rate cuts by the Federal Reserve are a concern as insurers are direct beneficiaries of an improved rate environment. A lower rate will weigh on net investment income. Given moderating pricing and increased competition, pricing competition will likely improve in 2025, per the Insurance Business report.<p><b>About the Industry</b></p><p>The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, and life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers&rsquo; compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The players also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payments compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.</p><p><b>3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance Industry</b></p><p><em><strong>Diversified portfolio lowers concentration risk</strong></em>:&nbsp; Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers&rsquo; product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. An increase in exposure with customized products and services should support premium growth. However, moderating pricing keeps us cautious. Per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. The increased adoption of artificial intelligence could increase potential cyber threats, thus fueling demand for cyber insurance.&nbsp; While the life insurance business could be hurt by a low interest rate environment as they invest a major portion of the premiums earned, prudent underwriting at the non-life insurance business will limit the downside. Yet, unpredictable catastrophes could weigh on the underwriting profitability of non-life insurers. Swiss Re estimates near mid-single-digit premium growth in 2025.<br /><br /><em><strong>Merger and acquisitions</strong></em>:&nbsp; Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players&rsquo; need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. Consolidations that slowed down earlier due to inflation are expected to rise in 2024. Insurance technology companies are expected to top the list per media reports. The industry is undergoing accelerated digitalization.<br /><br /><em><strong>Increased adoption of technology</strong></em>: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.&nbsp; Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Per the Deloitte FSI Predictions article, nonlife insurers have the capacity to generate nearly $4.7 billion in annual global premiums from AI-related insurance, translating to a compounded annual growth rate of around 80%.</p><p><b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak Prospects</b></p><p>The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #128, which places it in the bottom 48% of 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.<br /><br />The industry&rsquo;s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The weak outlook reflects that the industry&rsquo;s earnings estimates have been revised downward by analysts for the current year. Estimates for the current year moved 28.1% down in a year.<br /><br />Before we present a few multiline insurance stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let&rsquo;s take a look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.</p><p><b>Industry Underperforms Sector and S&P 500</b></p><p>The Multiline Insurance industry has underperformed the sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite year to date.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Property and Casualty insurer <strong>ProAssurance Corporation </strong>PRA is set to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 24, 2025, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter&rsquo;s earnings is currently pegged at 15 cents per share on revenues of $271.98 million.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks </em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong> <strong><em>to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The fourth-quarter earnings&nbsp;estimate remained stable over the past 60 days. The bottom-line projection indicates a year-over-year improvement of 400%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year decline of 4.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d7/94630.jpg?v=1487832513" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ProAssurance&rsquo;s revenues is pegged at $1.11 billion, implying a decline of 0.5% year over year. However, the consensus mark for 2024 EPS is pegged at 80 cents, signaling massive improvement from the year-ago loss of 14 cents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ProAssurancebeat the earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 61.5%. This is depicted in the figure below.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ProAssurance Corporation Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="ProAssurance Corporation Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/d2/1740064491.png" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">ProAssurance Corporation price-eps-surprise | ProAssurance Corporation Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Q4 Earnings Whispers for ProAssurance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the company this time around. The combination of a positive&nbsp;Earnings ESP&nbsp;and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That&rsquo;s not the case here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PRA has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our&nbsp;Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s Shaping ProAssurance&rsquo;s Q4 Results?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Rising investment income and decreasing expenses are likely to have aided its performance in the fourth quarter. While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for <strong>net investment income </strong>indicates 11.9% year-over-year growth, our model estimates a 12.5% increase.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus mark for <strong>net loss ratio </strong>is pegged at 78.57% for the fourth quarter, down from 78.90% a year ago, indicating improving efficiency. We expect <strong>total expenses</strong> to have declined by around 7% in the quarter under review.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for <strong>Workers&rsquo; Compensation Insurance unit&rsquo;s operating income</strong> indicates a 46.4% improvement from a year ago. Our model estimate for the Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance unit&rsquo;s<strong>operating income</strong> indicates a more than 30% increase from a year ago. These are likely to have aided the company&rsquo;s bottom line in the fourth quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the positives are likely to have been impacted by lower premiums earned. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for <strong>net premiums earned </strong>indicates a 6.5% decline from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s number, whereas our model estimates a 6.3% fall.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus mark for <strong>underwriting expense ratio</strong> is pegged at 33.07% for the quarter under review. Further, the consensus mark for <strong>Specialty P&amp;C Segment&rsquo;s</strong> <strong>operating income</strong> signals a more than 23% year-over-year deterioration, making an earnings beat uncertain.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How Did Other Stocks Perform?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some other stocks in the broader Finance space that have already reported earnings for this quarter: <strong>CNO Financial Group, Inc. </strong>CNO, <strong>American International Group, Inc. </strong>AIG and <strong>The Allstate Corporation</strong> ALL.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CNO Financial reported fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of $1.31, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.4%on the back of increased collected premiums across annuity, life and health products, driving an increase in total insurance policy income. Growth in fee revenues and a decline in overall expense level also contributed to the upside. However, the positives were partly offset by softer investment results.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">American Internationalreported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.30, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.2% supported by new business production, robust retention and lower expenses. Lower premiums and high catastrophe charges partially offset the positives.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Allstate reported a fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted net income of $7.67 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.8% on the back of growth in premiums and improved underwriting income and investment income. However, the upside was partly offset by elevated catastrophe losses and increased costs and expenses.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418914/will-lower-premiums-earned-affect-proassurance-s-q4-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2418914">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Can the Latest iPhone 16e Push the Apple Stock Higher in 2025? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Apple</strong> AAPL expanded the iPhone 16 family with the launch of a cheaper iPhone 16e version powered by the latest A18 chip and supporting Apple Intelligence. iPhone 16e features the new Apple C1, the first cellular modem designed by Apple, and a 48MP Fusion camera with an integrated 2x Telephoto option.<br /><br />iPhone 16e is available in a 6.1-inch display size and has the best battery life ever on this display size offered by Apple. The iPhone 16e, available from Feb. 28, will cost $599 compared with $799 for iPhone 16 and $999 for iPhone 16 Pro.</p><h2>Can the Affordable iPhone 16e Aid Apple&rsquo;s Market Share?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The affordable iPhone 16e is expected to boost Apple&rsquo;s footprint in price-sensitive countries like China and India. Apple has been suffering from sluggish demand for the iPhone in China amid increasing competition from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi, as well as the lack of Apple Intelligence. Although the iPhone 16e is still way pricier than devices like the Google Pixel 8A and OnePlus 12R, which cost below $500, the availability of Apple Intelligence can be a game changer.&nbsp;<br /><br />Although iPhone sales decreased 0.8% year over year to $69.14 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Apple saw better iPhone 16 sales in those regions where Apple Intelligence was available. iPhone&rsquo;s active installed base grew to an all-time high and saw a record level of upgrades in the reported quarter. Per Kantar, the iPhone was a top-selling model in the United States, Urban China, India, the U.K., France, Australia and Japan.<br /><br />Apple launched the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad and Mac, and introduced more features and expanded to more countries in December. Apple Intelligence is now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the U.K.</p><h2>Apple&rsquo;s Increasing Emerging Market Share is Positive</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Although Greater China sales decreased 11.1% year over year, Apple benefited from strong sales in a number of emerging markets, including India. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the iPhone was the top-selling model in the country. The company saw double-digit growth in the installed base in the emerging markets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Per Canalys&rsquo; latest data, Apple benefited from strong sales in emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific region in 2024. AAPL maintained its lead over Samsung for the second consecutive year, with a market share of 23% compared with the latter&rsquo;s 16%. Xiaomi trailed both Apple and Samsung with 13% market share. According to Canalys, global smartphone shipments increased 7% year over year to $1.22 billion units in 2024.</p><h2>Can Service Momentum Aid Apple&rsquo;s Prospects?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Apple shares have declined 2.3% year to date, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector&rsquo;s appreciation of 2.1%.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Apple Stock&rsquo;s Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ec/94628.jpg?v=282743931" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We believe the expanding launch of Apple Intelligence will drive further adoption of iPhone devices. In April, Apple is set to launch the next level of language updates with Apple Intelligence, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, simplified Chinese, and localized English to Singapore and India.&nbsp;<br /><br />AAPL&rsquo;s Services business is expected to drive top-line growth. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+, Apple Music and Apple Arcade, as well as the growing user base of Apple Pay, has helped drive subscriber growth.<br /><br />The Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It has expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the U.A.E., Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ is noteworthy.&nbsp;<br /><br />Apple expects the March-end quarter&rsquo;s (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low double digits on a year-over-year basis.</p><h2>AAPL Estimates Show Downward Trend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apple&rsquo;s second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings has declined 4.2% to $1.61 per share over the past 30 days, indicating 5.23% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />Apple&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with the average earnings surprise being 4.39%.<br />&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Apple Inc. Price and Consensus</h2><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Apple Inc. Price and Consensus" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/62/1740063613.png" title="" width="573" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Apple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. Quote</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar</strong></em>.</p><h2>Apple Shares Overvalued</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.<br /><br />Apple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 30.45X compared with the sector&rsquo;s 26.88X and higher than the median of 29.85X, reflecting a stretched valuation.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price/Earnings (F12M)</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f2/94629.jpg?v=1772060977" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>AAPL Shares: Buy, Sell or Hold?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Apple&rsquo;s AI push with Apple Intelligence is noteworthy. However, it is still playing catch-up with <strong>Microsoft</strong> MSFT, <strong>Alphabet</strong> GOOGL and <strong>Amazon</strong> AMZN.<br /><br />Although the Services business has emerged as AAPL&rsquo;s new cash cow, with an expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+, we believe that Apple Intelligence will take some time to go mainstream.<br /><br />Hence, we believe that Apple&rsquo;s near-term growth prospects do not justify a premium valuation.<br /><br />AAPL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Airbnb</strong> ABNB shares have jumped 12% in the past week following impressive fourth-quarter 2024 results, driven by strong 12% year-over-year growth in Nights &amp; Experiences Booked, which hit 111 million. Solid performances across all regions, especially in Asia Pacific and Latin America, drove Nights &amp; Experiences Booked.<br /><br />Airbnb app continues to gain traction, with nights booked on the app increasing 22% year over year and accounting for 60% of total nights booked, up from 55% in the year-ago quarter. ABNB saw notable acceleration in the number of first-time bookers on its platform, with Asia Pacific and Latin America, driving growth.<br /><br />ABNB&rsquo;s Gross Booking Value increased 13% year over year (or 15% year over year excluding forex) to $17.6 billion, driven by Nights &amp; Experiences Booked and a 1% (or 2% excluding forex) increase in Average Daily Rates.&nbsp;<br /><br />Airbnb is riding on its strong core business, strategic investments and expanding global footprint. Solid momentum in its marketplace, which connects hosts and guests online, and strong listings on its platform are helping ABNB grow in urban and non-urban areas.

These new businesses are expected to contribute significantly to revenue growth over the long haul.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ABNB&rsquo;s 2025 revenues is pegged at $12.17 billion, indicating growth of 9.6% over 2024.

The 2024 Winter Release included more than 50 upgrades aimed at improving guest experiences. These updates offered personalized features such as recommended destinations, suggested search filters and personalized listing highlights, making the app more tailored to individual preferences.<br /><br />Airbnb is focusing on expanding its presence in markets outside of its core regions, targeting areas that remain under-penetrated. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the average growth rate of gross nights booked on an origin basis in these expansion markets was more than twice the rate of its core markets, indicating that the strategy is effective and driving strong demand in newer regions.<br /><br />The launch of Co-Host Network, a program that helps local hosts to manage their Airbnb&rsquo;s, has been a growth driver. ABNB launched a Co-Host Network in 10 countries and is expanding it to Japan and Korea in the coming months. In the four months since launching, Co-Host Network has grown to support almost 100,000 listings, which earn roughly twice as much as Airbnb listings in comparable countries.&nbsp;<br /><br />Features like enhanced search functionality, better merchandising, flexible payment options, and the launch of local payment methods in roughly 12 countries, including Brazil, Korea and Indonesia are noteworthy developments. Airbnb is set to offer new offerings as part of its May 2025 summer release.</p><h2>ABNB Stock: Buy, Sell or Hold?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ABNB stock is not so cheap, as its Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.<br /><br />In terms of the forward 12-month price/earnings, ABNB is trading at a premium of 36.2X, higher than its median of 29.69X and the industry&rsquo;s 20.63X.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price/Sales Ratio (F12M)</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/82/94624.jpg?v=1388304006" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ABNB is suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions and fluctuating travel trends. Airbnb operates in a highly competitive online travel booking market, facing strong rivals such as <strong>Booking Holdings</strong> BKNG, <strong>Expedia</strong> EXPE, <strong>Trip.com</strong> TCOM, MakeMyTrip and various regional agencies.<br /><br />ABNB also faces stiff competition from online platforms offering experiences like Viator, GetYourGuide, Klook and Traveloka. TripAdvisor, Trivago, Mafengwo and AllTheRooms.com serve as significant competitors, particularly in the listing and meta-search space.<br /><br />Investments in new features are expected to hurt profitability in the near term. A stretched valuation remains a concern.<br /><br />ABNB currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise for investors to wait for a favorable entry point to accumulate the stock.

<![CDATA[ Carter's Q4 Earnings on the Horizon: Key Factors to Note ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Carter&#39;s, Inc. </strong>CRI is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 25, before the opening bell. The branded marketer of apparel, exclusively for babies and children in North America, is likely to witness a decline in the bottom and top lines when it reports the quarterly numbers.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $828.5 million, indicating a fall of 3.4% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for quarterly earnings, which has remained unchanged at $1.72 per share in the past 30 days, indicates a decrease of 37.7% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s figure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong><br /><br />The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 38.3%, on average. In the last reported quarter, CRI&rsquo;s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.1%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors to Note Ahead of CRI&rsquo;s Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Carter&rsquo;s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have shown impacts of inflation, elevated interest rates and the suspension of pandemic-related stimulus payments to child-care centers, hence, resulting in bleak demand for its products. In addition, the company has been witnessing higher selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A), as a percentage of sales, owing to fixed cost deleverage from lower sales, along with investments in brand marketing and retail stores, higher distribution expenses and rising transportation costs. The higher SG&amp;A expense rate is expected to have strained operating margins and reduced profitability.<br /><br />In addition, the company has been witnessing a tough retail landscape and adverse effects of foreign currency translations. These factors, along with reduced online traffic, are expected to have particularly dented the its top-line performance during the quarter under review.<br /><br />On its last reported quarter&rsquo;s earnings call, Carter&rsquo;s had projected net sales in the range of $800-$840 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, indicating a decline from $858 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. It had envisioned adjusted earnings of $1.32-$1.72 per share, down from $2.76 reported in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income was expected to be in the band of $70-$90 million, implying a decrease from $136 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. We expect an adjusted operating income of $83.1 million, down 38.9% year over year.<br /><br />In the U.S. Retail business, management had expected total sales to fall in the high-single digits to low-double digits for the fourth quarter. Sales in International are likely to decline in the mid to high-single digits for the impending quarter. For the U.S. Retail business, the company had expected a fall of 9-12% in comparable sales. Our model predicts a sales decline of 9.3% in the U.S. Retail and 5.5% in the International segment.<br /><br />On the flip side, Carter&rsquo;s has been making efforts to maneuver such challenges. The company has been implementing measures like improved pricing and optimized inventory management, apart from strengthening its e-commerce capabilities. For the fourth quarter, the company had anticipated sales to grow mid-single digits to high-single digits year over year in its U.S. Wholesale channel compared with our estimate of a 9% rise.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What the Zacks Model Unveils for CRI</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model doesn&rsquo;t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Carter&#39;s this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that&rsquo;s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />Carter&#39;s currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Carter&#39;s, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3><h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Carter's, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/10/1740059630.png" title="" width="533" /> </h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Carter&#39;s, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Carter&#39;s, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Carter&rsquo;s Valuation Picture</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">From a valuation perspective, Carter&rsquo;s offers an attractive opportunity, trading at a discount relative to historical and industry benchmarks. With a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 10.76x, which is below the five-year high of 21.14x and the Shoes and Retail Apparel industry&rsquo;s average of 28.1x, the stock offers compelling value for investors seeking exposure to the sector.<br /><br />The recent market movements show that CRI&rsquo;s shares have risen 0.5% in the past three months compared with the industry&#39;s 4% growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks With the Favorable Combination</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some companies that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.<br /><br /><strong>Accel Entertainment</strong> ACEL currently has an Earnings ESP of +26.83% and a Zacks Rank of 1. ACEL is likely to register top-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues is pegged at $308.9 million, indicating 4% growth from the figure in the year-ago quarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />The consensus estimate for ACEL&rsquo;s earnings is pegged at 21 cents a share, indicating a 19.2% drop from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s actual. ACEL has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.1%, on average.<br /><br /><strong>lululemon athletica</strong> LULU currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.24% and a Zacks Rank of 2. LULU is likely to register top-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues is pegged at $3.6 billion, indicating 11.5% growth from the figure in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for LULU&rsquo;s earnings is pegged at $5.83 a share, implying a 10.2% increase from the year-earlier quarter. LULU has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.7%, on average.<br /><br /><strong>Carnival </strong>CCL currently has an Earnings ESP of +70.81% and a Zacks Rank of 3. CCL is likely to register growth in its top and bottom lines when it reports first-quarter fiscal 2025 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues is pegged at $5.8 billion, indicating a 6.3% decrease from the figure in the year-ago quarter.<br />&nbsp;<br />The consensus estimate for CCL&rsquo;s earnings is pegged at two cents per share, implying a 114.3% surge from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s actual. CCL has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 326.4%, on average.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418888/carter-s-q4-earnings-on-the-horizon-key-factors-to-note?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2418888">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

Acquisitions boosted sales by 33.4% while foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 0.8%.<br /><br />Advanced Technology Solutions&rsquo; sales were $121.4 million, up 4.7% from the year-ago fiscal quarter&rsquo;s figure.

<![CDATA[ Tapestry to Offload Stuart Weitzman in $105M Deal With Caleres ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 16:21:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tapestry, Inc. </strong>TPR, a house of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands, has announced a definitive agreement to sell its Stuart Weitzman brand to <strong>Caleres, Inc.</strong> CAL for $105 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close in the summer of 2025.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">TPR &amp; CAL: Strategic Rationale</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Tapestry highlighted that the sale of Stuart Weitzman aligns with its strategy of optimizing brand portfolio for long-term success. The company emphasized that this move will enable it to focus more effectively on core brands, Coach and Kate Spade, while ensuring that Stuart Weitzman continues to grow under Caleres, a company with deep expertise in the footwear industry.<br /><br />Caleres, known for diverse portfolio of footwear brands, views the acquisition as an opportunity to strengthen its market presence. The company plans to integrate Stuart Weitzman into its operations while maintaining commitment to quality craftsmanship and innovation. With this acquisition, Stuart Weitzman will become a lead brand within the Caleres portfolio, contributing significantly to its Brand Portfolio segment, which is expected to generate nearly half of the company&rsquo;s total revenues and continue to drive a substantial portion of operating profit.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">TPR&rsquo;s Brand Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Tapestry delivered strong financial performance, driven by the continued momentum of its core brand. The company reported record quarterly revenues of $2.2 billion, up 5.3% year over year. This strong revenue growth was largely driven by Coach&rsquo;s outstanding performance, which improved 10% in constant currency.<br /><br />While Tapestry&rsquo;s overall revenues grew, Kate Spade&#39;s underperformance remains a key concern. The brand reported a 10% revenue decline in the fiscal second quarter, highlighting weakening consumer demand and ongoing challenges in customer acquisition. This decline is particularly concerning as TPR is actively working to revitalize the brand through a 15% reduction in handbag styles and increased marketing investments, aimed at improving brand engagement and sales momentum.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Stuart Weitzman continued to face headwinds, reporting a 16% revenue decline in the fiscal second quarter on a constant-currency basis. The decline was primarily caused by soft demand in Greater China and North America, as well as shipment timing issues in wholesale channels. Despite its strong brand recognition in the luxury footwear market, Stuart Weitzman&rsquo;s ongoing challenges prompted Tapestry to divest the brand to Caleres.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hasbro, Inc.</strong> HAS reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top line declined year over year while the bottom line increased from the prior year&#39;s quarter figure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hasbro unveiled a new strategic plan, Playing to Win, with a focus on expanding its global reach and enhancing profitability. The initiative aims to grow Hasbro&rsquo;s audience from 500 million to over 750 million through play-driven engagement and strategic partnerships. The company projects mid-single-digit revenue growth and annual operating margin improvements of 50-100 basis points through 2027. Additionally, Hasbro targets a 2.5x gross debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio by 2026 and expects its operational excellence program to generate $1 billion in cost savings.<br /><br />Following the announcements, the stock gained 3.9% in the pre-market trading session.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings &amp; Revenues</h2><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Hasbro, Inc.

The drop was due to lower volume. Adjusted operating margin was 8% against negative 15.3% reported in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />The Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment&rsquo;s revenues totaled $339 million, down 7% from $363.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 23.9% compared with 28.4% reported in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />The Entertainment segment&rsquo;s revenues plunged 91% year over year to $16.3 million. Adjusted operating margin was 1.2% against negative 17.9% reported in the year-ago quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Operating Highlights</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the fourth quarter, Hasbro&rsquo;s cost of sales (as percentages of net revenues) was 32.6% compared with 44.5% in the year-earlier quarter.<br /><br />Selling, distribution and administration expenses were $360.6 million, compared with $430.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />The company reported adjusted EBITDA of $164.8 million compared with $10.6 million a year ago.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Hasbro&rsquo;s Balance Sheet</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 29, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $695 million, compared with $545.4 million as of Dec. 31, 2023.

It expects adjusted operating margin to range between 21% and 22%. The company projects adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Updates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Hasbro&rsquo;s Playing to Win strategy marks a pivotal shift toward renewed growth by doubling down on play-focused brands and strategic partnerships. This approach has enabled the company to streamline operations, exit non-core businesses like eOne and cut $600 million in costs, strengthening its balance sheet. Hasbro is prioritizing high-margin, high-growth segments such as digital gaming, licensing and global partnerships, expanding into themed entertainment, quick-service restaurants and AAA video games.<br /><br />The strategy is built on five pillars: strengthening profitable franchises, targeting older demographics, expanding reach in emerging markets, enhancing digital and direct sales and scaling through partnerships. The company emphasizes operational upgrades in supply chain efficiency, AI and digital transformation, reinforcing its commitment to innovation, community engagement, and long-term sustainability.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">HAS&rsquo; Zacks Rank</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Hasbro currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong></p><h2>Recent Consumer Discretionary Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.</strong> HLT reported exceptional fourth-quarter 2024 results, wherein adjusted earnings and total revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year.<br /><br />The company&#39;s performance was backed by strong demand for leisure travel, with continued growth in business transient and group travel. These robust trends supported growth in occupancy and average daily rate, resulting in increased revenue per available room. Furthermore, favorable net unit growth compared with last year and the continuous efforts in expanding the portfolio globally added to the uptrend. HLT expects the robust travel trends to continue into 2025, positioning it to deliver strong results in the near term.<br /><br /><strong>Mattel, Inc.</strong> MAT reported fourth-quarter 2024 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. The top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis.<br /><br />In 2024, Mattel repurchased $400 million worth of shares and improved its leverage ratio. The company remains ahead of schedule in achieving its $200 million cost-savings target by 2026. For 2025, Mattel projects continued revenue and earnings growth, increased investments in digital gaming and a $600 million share repurchase program, underscoring its commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. MAT anticipates adjusted EPS in 2025 to be between $1.66 and $1.72 compared with $1.62 reported in 2024.<br /><br /><strong>Marriott International, Inc.</strong> MAR reported fourth-quarter 2024 results, with adjusted earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top line increased year over year while the bottom line declined from the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />Marriott posted strong results in 2024, driven by steady global travel demand and strategic portfolio expansion. The company&rsquo;s development momentum remained strong, with the signing of a record number of new deals and its development pipeline reaching 577,000 rooms. Given its vast global footprint, a loyalty program comprising nearly 228 million Marriott Bonvoy members and an asset-light model, MAR remains well-positioned to capitalize on travel demand and drive growth in the upcoming periods.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418880/hasbro-q4-earnings-surpass-estimates-revenues-decline-y-y?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418880">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Old National Bancorp.</strong> ONB has announced a new share repurchase program alongside quarterly cash dividends.<br /><br />Under the buyback plan, ONB will be able to repurchase up to $200 million worth of shares. The repurchase plan is set to expire on Feb. 28, 2026.<br /><br />This new program will replace the existing share repurchase plan, announced in February 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to this, ONB announced a share repurchase plan in February 2023 authorizing the repurchase of up to $200 million of shares, which expired on Feb. 29, 2024.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Old National Bancorp&rsquo;s Dividend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from share repurchases, Old National Bancorp has announced a quarterly cash dividend of 14 cents per share. The dividend will be paid out on March 17, 2025, to shareholders of record as of March 5.<br /><br />ONB pays quarterly dividends regularly and has increased dividends once in the last five years. In January 2020, the bank announced a 7.7% dividend hike from the prior payout to 14 cents per share and maintained the same level since then.<br /><br />Considering Wednesday&rsquo;s closing price of $24.30, its annualized dividend yield is 2.30%. Apart from being attractive to investors, the yield represents a steady income stream. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 30%.<br /><br />As of Dec. 31, 2024, Old National Bancorp&rsquo;s cash and due from banks was $394.5 million. The cash levels are decent relative to other borrowings of $689.6 million.<br /><br />Hence, a decent balance sheet position, along with its earnings strength, indicates that ONB&rsquo;s capital distributions are sustainable.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ONB&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Old National Bancorp have risen 30.3% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 18.2% growth in the past six months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f8/94618.jpg?v=1003612978" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, ONB carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Similar Steps by Other Finance Firms</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this month, <strong>Piper Sandler Companies</strong> PIPR announced a new share repurchase plan. The board of directors has approved the repurchase of up to $150 million worth of shares of PIPR&rsquo;s outstanding stock.<br /><br />The buyback program will be effective immediately and expire on Dec. 31, 2026. Before this, a share repurchase authorization was announced in May 2022, which expired on Dec. 31, 2024. Under this, PIPR was authorized to buy back up to $150 million worth of shares.<br /><br />Similarly, last month, <strong>Prosperity Bancshares, Inc.</strong> PB announced a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to 4.8 million of its common stock. This program is set to expire on Jan. 21, 2026.<br /><br />Prior to this, PB announced a share repurchase plan authorizing a buyback of up to 4.7 million shares in January 2024, which expired on Jan. 16, 2025.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418883/old-national-bancorp-announces-new-share-repurchase-plan-dividend?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_finance_sector-2418883">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ AstraZeneca Rises Almost 9% in a Month: How to Play the Stock ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 16:18:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AstraZeneca </strong>AZN stock has risen 8.6% in the past month, mainly due to mixed fourth-quarter results and a positive update from management regarding ongoing investigations at its China subsidiary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AstraZeneca missed fourth-quarter estimates for earnings but beat the same for sales. Revenues increased across all segments, with sales of most of the key drugs, including Tagrisso, Fasenra, Farxiga, Lynparza and Symbicort, beating estimates.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The British drugmaker said that the impact of the ongoing investigations in China remains minor on the business. In December, AstraZeneca appointed Iskra Reic as its new international executive vice president, replacing Leon Wang, who has been detained by authorities in China. They are investigating some current and former AstraZeneca employees for medical insurance fraud, illegal drug importation and personal information breaches.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AstraZeneca also issued fresh financial guidance for 2025 that was mostly in line with expectations. It expects total revenues to grow at a high single-digit percentage at CER.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s understand the company&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses to better analyze how to play AstraZeneca&rsquo;s stock in the post-earnings scenario.</p><h2>AZN&rsquo;s Strong Portfolio of Blockbuster Drugs</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AstraZeneca boasts a diversified geographical footprint as well as a product portfolio with several blockbuster medicines. AstraZeneca now has 16 blockbuster medicines in its portfolio with sales (product sales and alliance revenues) exceeding $1 billion, including Tagrisso, Fasenra, Farxiga, Imfinzi, Lynparza, Soliris and Ultomiris. These drugs are driving the company&rsquo;s top line backed by increasing demand trends. The company is confident that the growth will continue in 2025. Almost every new product it has launched in recent years has done well.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AZN Enjoys Strong Position in the Oncology Space</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Oncology is AstraZeneca&rsquo;s biggest segment. AstraZeneca is working on strengthening its oncology product portfolio through label expansions of existing products and progressing oncology pipeline candidates. Oncology sales (comprising around 41% of AstraZeneca&lsquo;s total revenues) rose 24% in 2024. The strong oncology performance was driven by medicines such as Tagrisso, Lynparza Imfinzi, Calquence and Enhertu (in partnership with Daiichi Sankyo).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A key new cancer drug approval was that of Truqap for HR-positive, HER2-negative (HR+ HER2-) breast cancer. The drug has seen a robust launch, recording sales of $430 million in 2024. In January this year, AstraZeneca and partner Daiichi&rsquo;s drug, Datroway/datopotamab deruxtecan was approved by the FDA for HR+ HER2- breast cancer while a regulatory application is under review for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AstraZeneca also has some important oncology candidates in its pipeline like camizestrant and volrustomig, both in late-stage development.</p><h2>AZN&rsquo;s Non-Cancer Pipeline Progress</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AstraZeneca has been making significant progress with its pipeline in areas other than oncology, like cardiovascular health, immunology and rare diseases. Some key new drug approvals include Voydeya&nbsp;to treat extravascular hemolysis in adults with the rare disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, Wainua (in partnership with <strong>Ionis </strong>[IONS]) for hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, commonly referred to as ATTRv-PN and respiratory syncytial virus antibody Beyfortus (in partnership with <strong>Sanofi </strong>[SNY]). Key pipeline candidates in late-stage development arebaxdrostat for treatment-resistant hypertension, eneboparatide for chronic hypoparathyroidism and ALXN-2220 for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AstraZeneca is investing in disruptive innovation and transformative new technologies and platforms to discover novel medicines. The company is exploring modalities such as cell, gene and RNA therapies, epigenetics and oligonucleotides to identify new treatment approaches.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2024, it acquired small biotechs like Gracell, Fusion Pharmaceuticals and Amolyt to strengthen its pipeline.</p><h2>China Investigations &ndash; A Near-Term Overhang for AZN</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">There have been rising concerns over the ongoing investigations at AstraZeneca&rsquo;s China subsidiary.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AstraZeneca received a notification from a Chinese customs office regarding unpaid import duties totaling $0.9 million, which the company believes is related to Imfinzi and Imjudo. AstraZeneca may be imposed with a fine of one and five times the amount of unpaid importation taxes if found liable. Though AstraZeneca is working with the government for resolving these investigations, the issue will remain an overhang until then.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AstraZeneca expects Farxiga and Lynparza to be included in the volume-based procurement plans in China in 2025, which can hurt sales of these drugs in the country.</p><h2>AZN Stock&rsquo;s Price, Valuation &amp; Estimates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AstraZeneca&rsquo;s stock has risen 13.4% in the past year against a decrease of 5.2% for the industry.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">AstraZeneca Stock Underperforms Industry</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a9/94538.jpg?v=244554930" style="height: 310px; width: 600px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>From a valuation standpoint, AstraZeneca appears slightly attractive relative to the industry. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company&rsquo;s shares currently trade at 16.11 forward earnings, lower than 16.61 for the industry as well as its 5-year mean of 18.23.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">AZN Stock Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/23/94539.jpg?v=162171734" style="height: 310px; width: 600px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has declined from $4.70 per share to $4.52 per share over the past 30 days. For 2026, earnings estimates have declined from $5.24 per share to $5.00 per share over the same timeframe.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">AZN Estimate Movement</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ad/94537.jpg?v=1280198819" style="height: 310px; width: 600px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Stay Invested in AZN Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite headwinds like potentially lower sales of Farxiga and Lynparza in China in 2025 and ongoing China investigations, the company is confident of continued growth momentum in the Oncology, Rare Disease and CVRM segments in 2025. AstraZeneca believes that outside China. Farxiga and Lynparza sales should continue to grow due to continued market leadership.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Backed by its new products and pipeline drugs, AstraZeneca believes it can post industry-leading top-line growth in the 2025-2030 period. AstraZeneca expects to generate$80 billion in total revenues by 2030. By the said time frame, AstraZeneca plans to launch 20 new medicines, of which six have already been launched. It believes that many of these new medicines will have the potential to generate more than $5 billion in peak-year revenues. The company is also on target to achieve a mid-30s percentage core operating margin by 2026</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors who own AstraZeneca&rsquo;s stock may stay invested as the company shows potential to generate consistent profits.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AstraZeneca has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The S&amp;P 500 set another record high on Wednesday, climbing 0.24% to close at 6,144.15, marking its second consecutive all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.16% to settle at 44,627.59, while the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.07% to 20,056.25, extending its winning streak to five sessions.<br /><br />Investor optimism persisted despite the ongoing trade uncertainties and the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s cautious stance on interest rate cuts. Economic data and earnings reports in the coming weeks will play key roles in determining whether this market has further room to run or if volatility will return. But at this juncture, investors might consider balancing their portfolios with value stocks. Typically trading below their intrinsic value, these stocks offer a margin of safety during market fluctuations.<br /><br />When evaluating value stocks, one of the most effective valuation metrics is the Price to Cash Flow (P/CF) ratio. This metric measures the market price of a stock relative to the cash flow the company generates on a per-share basis. A lower P/CF ratio indicates that the stock is trading at a better value, offering strong cash generation potential relative to its price. Here are four companies &mdash; <strong>EnerSys</strong> ENS, <strong>Sonoco Products Company</strong> SON, <strong>World Kinect Corporation</strong> WKC and <strong>General Motors Company</strong> GM.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Questions may arise as to why we are considering the P/CF valuation metric when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, reflecting a company&#39;s financial health.<br /><br />Analysts caution that a company&rsquo;s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.<br /><br />A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company&rsquo;s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company&rsquo;s liquidity, which lowers its flexibility to support these moves.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s the Best Value Investing Strategy?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a <strong>Value Score</strong> of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.<br /><br />Here are the parameters for selecting true-value stocks:&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Price greater than or equal to 5:</strong> The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.<br /><br /><strong>Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000:</strong> A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.<br /><br /><strong>P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median:</strong> This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.<br /><br />P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.<br /><br /><strong>P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median:</strong> The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company&rsquo;s sales &mdash; the lower the ratio, the more attractive the stock is.<br /><br /><strong>PEG less than 1:</strong> The ratio is used to determine a stock&#39;s value by taking the company&#39;s earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2:</strong> Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.<br /><br /><strong>Value Score of less than or equal to B:</strong> Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.<br /><br />Here are four of the 12 value stocks that qualified the screening:<br /><br /><strong>EnerSys</strong>, the global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.2%, on average. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EnerSys&rsquo; current financial year sales and earnings per share (EPS) suggests growth of 1% and 19.8%, respectively, from the year-ago period. ENS has a Value Score of A. Shares of ENS were up 12.4% in the past year.<br /><br /><strong>Sonoco Products</strong>, a global leader in high-value sustainable packaging, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2%, on average.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sonoco Products&rsquo; current financial year sales and EPS calls for growth of 35.1% and 48.1%, respectively, from the year-ago period. SON has a Value Score of A. Shares of SON have declined 18% in the past year.<br /><br /><em><strong>See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</strong></em><br /><br /><strong>World Kinect</strong>, a global energy management company offering fulfillment and related services, sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.1%, on average.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for World Kinect&rsquo;s current financial year EPS implies growth of 6.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period. WKC has a Value Score of A. Shares of WKC have rallied 14.7% in the past year.<br /><br /><strong>General Motors</strong>, which designs, builds and sells cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts globally, carries a Zacks Rank #2.

<![CDATA[ AOS Stock Exhibits Strong Prospects Despite Persisting Headwinds ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A. O. Smith Corporation</strong> AOS has solidified its product portfolio and leveraged business opportunities through asset additions. The company acquired the Pureit business from Unilever in November 2024. The inclusion of Pureit&rsquo;s expertise in water treatment solutions, coupled with its strong brand recognition, expanded A. O. Smith&rsquo;s customer offerings and boosted its position in the water treatment industry in India. In March 2024, the company acquired privately held water treatment company Impact Water Products, which boosted its water treatment footprint in North America. The acquired company is included in the North America segment.&nbsp;<br /><br />The June 2022 acquisition of Atlantic Filter boosted the company&rsquo;s position in the water treatment industry and strengthened its customer base in Florida and the adjacent regions. The company spent $145.9 million on acquisitions in 2024. Also, improving supply chains are driving shipments at its facilities.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s shareholder-friendly policies are encouraging. In 2024, AOS paid dividends worth $190.4 million, up 3.8% year over year. In October 2024, the company increased the dividend by 6% to 34 cents per share (annually: $1.36). It has increased dividends consecutively for more than 30 years. In 2024, AOS also repurchased 3.8 million shares for $305.8 million. While exiting the fourth quarter, 1.7 million shares were left to be repurchased under the existing authorization. The company expects to repurchase shares worth approximately $400 million in 2025. A. O. Smith has a sound liquidity position. At the end of the fourth quarter, it had cash and cash equivalents of $239.6 million, much higher than the current debt of $10 million. Exiting the quarter, the company had a long-term debt of $183.2 million. This implies that it has sufficient cash to meet its debt obligations.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Downsides of AOS</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The ongoing challenges in the Chinese real estate market are concerning for A. O. Smith. Lower volumes of water heaters and water treatment products in the region are affecting the Rest of World segment&rsquo;s performance. Also, a decline in orders for residential and commercial water heater products in the North America segment is worrisome. Also, lower volumes of residential and commercial water heaters are affecting the segment&rsquo;s performance.<br /><br />A. O. Smith has a significant presence in Asian countries like China and India. Since its products are priced in the local currencies of these countries, any increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies would impact its revenues and profitability. For example, adverse foreign currency movements lowered the Rest of the World segment&rsquo;s revenues by $13 million in 2024.<br /><br />In the year-to-date period, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company&rsquo;s shares have lost 0.7% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 3.1% decline.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7e/94627.jpg?v=1234162735" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked companies are discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Alcoa Corporation</strong> AA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />AA delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 43.6%. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alcoa&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has increased 12.2%.<br /><br /><strong>Enersys</strong> ENS presently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 2.2%.<br /><br />In the past 60 days, the consensus estimate for ENS&rsquo; fiscal 2025 earnings has increased 10%.<br /><br /><strong>Applied Industrial Technologies </strong>AIT presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. AIT delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 5.3%.<br /><br />In the past 60 days, the consensus estimate for AIT&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings has inched up 1.1%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418879/aos-stock-exhibits-strong-prospects-despite-persisting-headwinds?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|zer_report_update-2418879">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ionis Pharmaceuticals </strong>IONS incurred a loss of 66 cents per share for fourth-quarter 2024, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.12 per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Earnings included compensation expenses related to equity awards. Excluding these special items, adjusted loss per share was 43 cents against a gain of 12 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues were $227 million in the fourth quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $137.5 million. However, revenues declined 30.2% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past year, Ionis&rsquo; shares have declined 26.9% compared with the industry&rsquo;s decrease of 10.2%.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/5b/94552.jpg?v=340022038" style="height: 315px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">IONS&rsquo; Different Sources of Revenues</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Ionis licensed Spinraza to <strong>Biogen</strong> BIIB, which is responsible for commercializing it. Spinraza is approved for treating spinal muscular atrophy worldwide. Ionis receives royalties from Biogen on Spinraza&rsquo;s sales. Ionis and Biogen also market Qalsody (tofersen) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutations. Qalsody was launched in the United States in 2023 and in the EU in May 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ionis and <strong>AstraZeneca</strong>&rsquo;s AZN Wainua (eplontersen) was approved by the FDA in December 2023 for treating patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloid polyneuropathy, commonly called hATTR-PN or ATTRv-PN. AstraZeneca and Ionis co-market Wainua for ATTRv-PN in the&nbsp;United States. AstraZeneca has exclusive rights to commercialize Wainua in outside U.S. markets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the launch of Wainua in the United States, Ionis receives royalties from AstraZeneca, which is included in commercial revenues. Wainua is under review in the EU.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In December 2024, the FDA approved Ionis&rsquo; first wholly-owned drug, Tryngolza (olezarsen), an RNA-targeted therapy, for&nbsp;treating familial chylomicronemia syndrome, a serious rare disease for which no treatments were approved in the United States until now. The drug was launched in the United States in late December. A marketing authorization application is also under review in the EU.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">IONS&#39; Commercial Revenues Rise</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Commercial revenues were $86 million in the fourth quarter, up 8.9% year over year. Commercial revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Commercial revenues from Spinraza royalties were $64 million, up 1.6% year over. Spinraza sales, as recorded by Biogen, were $421.4 million, up 2% year over year. Spinraza royalties beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $61 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the quarter, Wainua royalty revenues were $10 million. Wainua generated sales of $42 million in the fourth quarter, as recorded by AstraZeneca, up 84% on a sequential basis. Ionis said that Wainua delivered accelerating sequential growth throughout 2024 on strong uptake.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Other commercial revenues were $12 million compared with $17 million in the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Other commercial revenues included revenues from Tegsedi and Waylivra distribution fees and license and royalty revenues. License and royalty revenues also included royalties from Qalsody U.S. product sales.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">IONS&#39; R&amp;D Revenues Decline</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">R&amp;D revenues declined 42.7% year over year to $141 million. R&amp;D revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $57 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Collaborative agreement revenues were $97 million in the quarter compared with $179 million in the year-ago quarter. Joint development revenues for Wainua from partner AstraZeneca were $44 million in the quarter compared with $67 million in the year-ago quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">IONS&#39; Costs Decline</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted operating costs declined 1.3% year over year to $301 million in the quarter. SG&amp;A costs rose 18.5% to support the launches of Wainuaand Tryngolza. R&amp;D costs declined 7.2% in the quarter as several late-stage studies ended.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">IONS&rsquo; Full-Year 2024 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2024, Ionis incurred a loss of $3.04 per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.47 per share. The loss in the year-ago quarter was $2.56 per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues were $705 million in 2024, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $618.6 million. Revenues declined 10.5% year over year. Revenues also beat the company&rsquo;s guidance of more than $575 million in 2024.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">IONS Issues 2025 Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Ionis issued fresh financial guidance for 2025. The company expects total revenues to be more than $600 million in 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $675.1 million. Ionis expects its revenues to shift toward increasing commercial revenues. R&amp;D revenues are expected to be lower than the 2024 level with most of it coming in the second half.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted operating loss is expected to be less than $495 million. Adjusted operating expenses are expected to increase in the high single-digit percentage range in 2025 due to higher SG&amp;A costs. SG&amp;A costs are expected to increase as the company invests in go-to-market activities for Tryngolza and the potential launch of donidalorsen. R&amp;D costs are expected to be similar to 2024 levels.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company expects to end 2025 with approximately $1.7 billion in cash.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Update on IONS&rsquo; Wholly-Owned Candidates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Olezarsen is also being evaluated in three late-stage studies for severe hypertriglyceridemia, which involves a much larger patient population. Enrollment has been completed in these studies, and data are expected in the second half of 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">IONS&rsquo; other wholly-owned candidates are donidalorsen and zilganersen.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In November, the FDA accepted Ionis&rsquo; NDA&nbsp;seeking approval of donidalorsen for treating&nbsp;hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. HAE is a rare and potentially life-threatening genetic condition. The FDA decision on the NDA is expected on Aug. 21, 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Management expects donidalorsen to be its second independent commercial launch. Additionally, Ionis&rsquo; partner, Otsuka, submitted a regulatory application in the EU.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zilganersen is being evaluated in a phase III study for treating Alexander disease, a rare leukodystrophy with no approved therapies. Data from the study is expected in 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A global pivotal phase III study on another candidate, ION582, for treating Angelman syndrome, a rare disorder, is expected to begin in the first half of 2025.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Update on IONS&rsquo; Partnered Candidates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AstraZeneca and Ionis are also developing Wainua for another form of amyloidosis called cardiomyopathy caused by hereditary TTR amyloidosis (ATTR-CM), which has a larger market than ATTRv-PN. Data from the phase III CARDIO-TTRANSform study in ATTR-CM is expected in the second half of 2026.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Among some wholly owned candidates, Ionis&rsquo; partner <strong>Novartis </strong>NVS is developing pelacarsen in late-stage studies for elevated Lp(a)-driven CVD, with data expected this year. Along with GSK, the company is developing bepirovirsen as a potential treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus in two ongoing late-stage studies. The studies are now fully enrolled, with data expected in 2026.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">IONS&rsquo; Zacks Rank</h2><p>Ionis currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ 2 Retail REITs Poised to Gain Despite Industry Challenges ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 16:15:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry constituents are expected to face a challenging environment because of the growth in e-commerce. Moreover, fiscal policy, trade policy and changing consumer spending patterns present risks to the retail real estate market. Also, the inflationary impact of such policies may prompt the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high, negatively affecting interest-sensitive retail REITs.<br /><br />However, the resilient consumer environment and limited new construction support stable demand, with high-quality locations continuing to outperform. Additionally, experiential retail, designed to boost foot traffic and engagement, is expected to play a significant role in revitalizing retail real estate. Amid this, <strong>Essential Properties Realty Trust, Inc.</strong> EPRT and <strong>Urban Edge Properties</strong> UE are expected to continue to benefit.<p><b>Industry Description</b></p><p>The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry comprises REITs that own, develop, manage and lease various retail properties, including regional malls, outlet centers, grocery-anchored shopping venues and power centers with big-box retailers. Net lease REITs focus on freestanding properties, where tenants bear rent and most operating expenses. Retail REIT performance is significantly impacted by economic conditions, employment levels and consumer spending trends. Key drivers of demand include the geographic location of properties and the demographics of surrounding trade areas. While the industry faced significant challenges from declining foot traffic, store closures and retailer bankruptcies in the past, it is now experiencing a rebound driven by renewed consumer interest in in-store shopping, signaling a positive shift in the retail landscape.</p><p><b>What's Shaping the Future of the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail Industry?</b></p><p><em><strong>Macroeconomic Uncertainty and Tariff Impacts:</strong></em> Macroeconomic uncertainty, along with the potential effects of fiscal policies such as tariffs, presents risks to the retail real estate market. While retail demand remains healthy, any fluctuations in consumer spending due to economic volatility could significantly affect the sector. Tariffs, in particular, place additional pressure on retailers dependent on low-cost imports, increasing financial strain and heightening the likelihood of store closures, rising vacancies and reduced cash flow for retail REITs. Factors like higher budget deficits and potential shifts in trade policies could worsen inflation, restraining consumer spending. The inflationary impact of tariffs and other policies may prompt the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high, negatively affecting interest-sensitive retail REITs. These REITs, which are heavily reliant on debt, are particularly vulnerable to investor concerns during periods of high borrowing costs.</p><p><em><strong>E-commerce Growth Affects Foot Traffic:</strong></em> The rise of e-commerce continues to pose challenges for brick-and-mortar retailers and their landlords, even with the implementation of omnichannel strategies. The ease of online shopping is leading some retailers to avoid expanding physical stores, decreasing the demand for retail space. As online sales continue to grow, many traditional retailers are responding by downsizing their store footprints or consolidating locations. This shift is especially noticeable in sectors like apparel and electronics, where the demand for large retail spaces is getting affected. Additionally, the growth of online shopping has increased the appeal of open-air shopping centers &mdash; such as neighborhood, community, and strip malls &mdash; over traditional enclosed malls, as retailers prioritize making it easier for customers to pick up and return online orders.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Balanced Market Dynamics and Experiential Retail:</strong></em> Retail REITs are poised to continue benefiting from a strong consumer market, limited new construction and a stable tenant mix, with demand driven by traditional retail, consumer services and cross-border entrants. Prime locations continue to outperform due to the ongoing &quot;flight to quality&quot; trend. Additionally, experiential retail, designed to boost foot traffic and engagement, is expected to play a significant role in revitalizing retail real estate. There is an increasing focus on enhancing the customer experience by incorporating entertainment, dining and interactive features in retail properties. This approach not only attracts and retains customers but also transforms shopping into an immersive experience. By offering more value through unique interactions, physical stores are maximizing their space usage, catering to the modern consumer&rsquo;s desire for experiences. This strategy encourages longer visits, boosts sales and drives up demand for well-located retail properties. Also, mixed-use developments, blending retail, residential and entertainment, are becoming pivotal in revitalizing urban spaces and driving vibrancy.</p><p><b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects</b></p><p>The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #151, which places it in the bottom 39% of around 250 Zacks industries.</p><p>The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p>The industry&rsquo;s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the upward funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group&rsquo;s growth potential. Over the past year, the industry&rsquo;s FFO per share estimates for 2025 and 2026 have moved 5.7% and 7.8% south.</p><p>However, before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let&rsquo;s take a look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.</p><p><b>Industry Underperforms Sector and S&P 500</b></p><p>The REIT and Equity Trust - Retail Industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.</p><p>The industry has advanced 6.6% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s rise of 24.1% and the broader Finance sector&rsquo;s growth of 25.5%.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>One-Year Price Performance</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/retail reit_price performance_20250220.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 299px;" /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><b>Industry's Current Valuation</b></p><p>On the basis of forward 12-month price-to-FFO, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing retail REITs, we see that the industry is currently trading at 16.37X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 22.71X. The industry is also trading below the Finance sector&rsquo;s forward 12-month P/E of 17.38X.

This focus on service-oriented and experience-based tenants helps generate stable rental cash flows as such businesses are less susceptible to competition from Internet retailing. With a weighted average lease term of 14 years and an average unit-level rent coverage ratio of 3.5 as of Dec. 31, 2024, EPRT is well-poised to ride the growth curve.&nbsp;<br /><br />Essential Properties currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 FFO per share has been marginally revised upward over the past week to $1.89. This also suggests an 8.6% increase year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2025 FFO per share has been raised 1.4% upward over the past two months to $1.40, indicating a 3.7% year-over-year increase. Moreover, the consensus estimate for 2026 FFO per share has moved marginally northward over the past two months. Though the stock has declined 11.8% in the past three months, it currently offers a good entry point.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/ue_20250220.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 312px;" /></p><p>Note: <em>Funds from operations (FFO) is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations.

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>AZUL&nbsp;</strong>AZUL is scheduled to report&nbsp;fourth-quarter 2024&nbsp;results on Feb. 24, before market open.</p><p><strong><em>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p>AZUL has a discouraging earnings surprise history, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters. The average miss is 100.8%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>AZUL Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="AZUL Price and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/f8/1740062784.png" title="" width="527" /> <p>AZUL price-eps-surprise | AZUL Quote</p></div><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AZUL&rsquo;s earnings for soon-to-be-reported quarter has remained flat at 12 cents per share over the past 60 days. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $957.6 million, which indicates a fall of 5.7% year over year.</p><p>High operating expenses are likely to have hurt the company&rsquo;s bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Per our estimate, the total operating expenses are expected to increase 2% year over year. High labor and fuel costs are likely to have led to an uptick in operating costs.</p><p>On the contrary, the upbeat air travel demand is expected to have contributed to the company&rsquo;s prospects in the December-end quarter.</p><p><strong>What Our Model Says About AZUL Stock</strong></p><p>Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AZUL this time. The combination of a positive&nbsp;Earnings ESP&nbsp;and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.</p><p>AZUL has an Earnings ESP of -59.18% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our&nbsp;Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p><strong>Highlights of AZUL&#39;s Q3 Results</strong></p><p>Azul incurred a loss of 32 cents per share in the third quarter of 2024, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 10 cents.</p><p>Total revenues of $925.1 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $953.2 million. AZUL&rsquo;s third-quarter 2024 revenues benefit from a healthy demand environment and robust ancillary revenues.</p><h2><strong>A Stock to Consider</strong></h2><p>Here is a stock from the broader Zacks&nbsp;Transportation&nbsp;sector that investors might want to consider, as our model shows that this stock has the right combination of elements to beat fourth-quarter 2024 earnings.</p><p><strong>Golar LNG Limited&nbsp;</strong>GLNG has an Earnings ESP of +11.58% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2024 earnings results on Feb. 27.</p><p>GLNG has an encouraging earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the preceding four quarters and missing once. The average beat is 30.2%.</p><h2><strong>Q4 Performances of Other Transportation Companies</strong></h2><p><strong>Delta Air Lines&nbsp;</strong>DAL reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings (excluding 56 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.85 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76. Earnings increased 44.5% on a year-over-year basis due to low fuel costs.</p><p>DAL&rsquo;s revenues of $15.56 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.99 billion and increased 9.4% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong holiday travel demand. Adjusted operating revenues (excluding third-party refinery sales) totaled $14.44 billion, up 5.7% year over year. Passenger revenues, which accounted for 82.4% of total revenues, increased 5% year over year at $12.82 billion.</p><p><strong>J.B. Hunt Transport Services&nbsp;</strong>JBHT reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings per share of $1.53, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62. The bottom line increased 4.1% on a year-over-year basis.</p><p>JBHT&rsquo;s total operating revenues of $3.15 billion narrowly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.13 billion but declined 4.8% year over year. The decline was mainly due to lower fuel surcharge revenues and yield pressure in its Intermodal segment.</p><p>JBHT&rsquo;s fourth-quarter 2024 operating revenues of $2.78 billion, excluding fuel surcharge revenues, decreased 2% from the year-ago reported quarter. Total operating income for the reported quarter increased 2% year over year to $207 million.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418876/azul-s-q4-earnings-coming-up-what-s-in-the-offing-for-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2418876">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gibraltar Industries, Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s ROCK fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. On the other hand, net sales missed the consensus mark and tumbled year over year.<br /><br /><em><strong>See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</strong></em><br /><br />The quarter&rsquo;s bottom-line performance was backed by a favorable mix shift and continued strong operating execution. Although the timing on a large project last year hampered the net sales growth during the quarter, the company is optimistic about the prospects given the robust public spending trends at the federal and state levels.<br /><br />ROCK stock jumped 11.7% during Wednesday&rsquo;s trading hours, after the earnings announcement. Investors&rsquo; sentiments are likely to have been boosted by the company&rsquo;s 2025 business outlook, indicating year-over-year growth in net sales and earnings per share (EPS).</p><h2>Inside ROCK&rsquo;s Headlines</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s adjusted EPS of $1.01 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents by 7.5%. In the year-ago quarter, it reported an adjusted EPS of 85 cents (adjusted financial measures previously reported).</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Gibraltar Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Gibraltar Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/16/1740060809.png" title="" width="568" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Gibraltar Industries, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Gibraltar Industries, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Quarterly net sales of $302.1 million lagged the consensus mark of $315 million by 4.1% and decreased 8.1% from the prior-year level of $328.8 million. On an adjusted basis, the top line fell 7.9% year over year from $327.9 million. The ongoing industry headwinds impacting the Renewables business accompanied by continued slowness in the Residential market triggered the downtrend.</p><h2>Gibraltar&rsquo;s Segmental Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Residential:</strong> Net sales in the segment were down 4.8% year over year to $170.7 million. The downtick was due to the ongoing market softness, 80/20 PLS initiatives on the safety harness and drywall metals product lines and delays in the transition of new businesses awarded in 2024.<br /><br />However, the adjusted operating margin of 17.3% contracted 20 basis points (bps) in the quarter due to unfavorable volume and product mix, partially offset by solid execution, 80/20 initiatives and effective price/cost management. The adjusted EBITDA margin was flat at 19.2% year over year.<br /><br /><strong>Renewables:</strong> Net sales in the segment decreased 19.6% from the year-ago quarter to $70.5 million (down 18.8% on an adjusted basis). The decline was caused due to customers completing panel installations ahead of the Dec. 3, 2024 deadline related to the June 2024 expiration of the Presidential Proclamation. The new contract signings being pushed to January 2025 adversely impacted the fourth-quarter backlog, reducing it by 32% on a year-over-year basis.<br /><br />The adjusted operating margin of 7.2% contracted 630 bps year over year due to an unfavorable product mix owing to the 1P tracker product coupled with lower volumes. The adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 550 bps from the prior-year quarter to 10.6%.<br /><br /><strong>Agtech:</strong> This segment&rsquo;s net sales inched up 0.7% year over year to $42.7 million. Backlog was down 23% year over year because of the shift of new project signings from the fourth quarter to 2025.<br /><br />The adjusted operating margin expanded a whopping 2,270 bps year over year to 19.4%, attributable to strong execution, a favorable business mix and a benefit realized from a customer payment that was written off in the prior year&rsquo;s quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin also grew significantly by 2,240 bps year over year to 21.4%.<br /><br /><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Net sales in the segment tumbled 6.7% year over year to $18.1 million, due to unfavorable impacts from the timing of a large project in the prior year. However, backlog grew year over year by 10% on the strong conversion of bid volume. The continued robust investment scenario at the federal and state levels is encouraging.<br /><br />The adjusted operating margin of 20.4% expanded 180 bps year over year, driven by a favorable mix shift and continued strong operating execution. The adjusted EBITDA margin also expanded 170 bps from the prior-year quarter to 24.8%.</p><h2>Operating Highlights of ROCK</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted operating income increased to $38.3 million from $34.4 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin expanded 220 bps year over year to 12.7% from 10.5% (adjusted operating margin previously reported).<br /><br />Adjusted EBITDA of $46.7 million increased from $43.6 million (adjusted EBITDA previously reported) in the year-ago period. The adjusted EBITDA margin also expanded 220 bps from the prior year to 15.5%.</p><h2>A Glimpse of Gibraltar&rsquo;s 2024 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the full year, Gibraltar reported net sales of $1.31 billion, down from $1.38 billion reported in 2023.&nbsp; Adjusted earnings during the year were $4.25 per share, up from $4.11 (adjusted financial measures previously reported) reported in 2023.<br /><br />Adjusted operating margin increased year over year to 12.8% from 12.7%. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.7% was up 30 bps from the prior year.</p><h2>ROCK&rsquo;s Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, Gibraltar had total liquidity of $665 million, including cash and cash equivalents worth $269.5 million compared with $99.4 million at 2023-end. There was no long-term debt at the end of 2024.<br /><br />In 2024, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $174.3 million compared with $218.5 million in the prior-year period.</p><h2>Gibraltar Unveils 2025 Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company expects net sales to be in the range of $1.40-$1.45 billion.<br /><br />GAAP EPS is still expected to be in the range of $4.25-$4.50 compared with $4.46 in 2024. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.80-$5.05.<br /><br />The company expects participation gains to support growth in its existing businesses. Furthermore, it expects the Renewables business to improve execution with solid growth and margin contribution from the addition of Lane Supply in the Agtech segment in 2025.</p><h2>ROCK&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Gibraltar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated</strong> LEG reported fourth-quarter 2024 results, with earnings meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues beating the same. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics declined.<br /><br />The quarterly results indicated weak demand in the company&rsquo;s residential end markets due to a challenging macro environment and soft consumer spending. Softening in Automotive and Hydraulic Cylinders further impacted its performance. Although LEG carried out its restructuring and operating efficiency improvement initiatives, the headwinds mentioned above overshadowed the prospects to a great extent.<br /><br /><strong>Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.</strong> MLM reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2024, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. Both the top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis.<br /><br />Despite challenges in 2024&mdash;such as bad weather, reduced construction demand and tighter monetary policies&mdash;the company still achieved earnings growth and record profits in the fourth quarter. This was driven by $6 billion in strategic acquisitions and divestitures, reshaping the portfolio to focus more on aggregates, improving margins and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Looking ahead, MLM is confident that strong infrastructure and data center demand will help it meet its 2025 adjusted EBITDA target of $2.25 billion.<br /><br /><strong>Masco Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s MAS fourth-quarter 2024 earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Earnings topped expectations in six of the trailing seven quarters. On the other hand, the net sales missed the consensus mark and tumbled year over year.<br /><br />The quarter&rsquo;s top-line results reflect lower sales volume for North American plumbing products, lower net selling prices of decorative architectural products and an unfavorable sales mix of plumbing products. However, the bottom line was favored by lower selling, general and administrative expenses, favorable net selling prices and strategic cost savings initiatives. Moving into 2025, the company aims to continue maintaining shareholder value through its top-tier repair and remodel-oriented product portfolio, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418864/gibraltar-s-q4-earnings-top-estimates-while-sales-miss-stock-up?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418864">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Here's Why Investors Should Retain JBLU Stock in Their Portfolio Now ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 16:02:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JetBlue Airways&nbsp;</strong>JBLU benefits from robust operational efficiency and customer-friendly initiatives. The company&rsquo;s efforts toward network optimization are also encouraging. However, high labor costs are hurting JBLU&rsquo;s prospects.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Factors Favoring JBLU Stock</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2024, JetBlue made significant strides in operational performance. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the airline boosted on-time performance by six percentage points and saw a nearly ten-point increase in customer satisfaction. Additionally, JetBlue made a remarkable leap in the Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s 2024 Airline Rankings, rising three spots from last place in 2023 to 6th overall.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The introduction of the JetBlue Premier Card is a strategic initiative aimed at bolstering customer loyalty and attracting high-value, frequent travelers. By leveraging the premium card&#39;s annual fee and rewards program, JetBlue is poised to drive additional revenues and enhance long-term customer retention. This move not only strengthens the airline&#39;s market position but also elevates its brand value and profitability. With appealing benefits for loyal customers and tapping into the rising demand for premium travel products, JetBlue is reinforcing its competitive edge and improving its growth prospects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The airline optimized around 20% of its network in 2024, with significant changes taking place between October 2024 and January 2025. This included the closure of 15 BlueCities and the introduction of new services to various destinations, indicating a more strategic and focused approach to its routes. This positions JetBlue well for sustainable growth. The airline&rsquo;s actions to improve service quality and operational efficiency, coupled with solid financial management, are likely to bolster investor confidence and contribute to long-term shareholder value.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Owing to such tailwinds, JBLU&rsquo;s shares have rallied 53.7% in six months compared with its&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 30.5% growth.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/2e/94610.jpg?v=960614945" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JBLU: Key Risks to Watch</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The&nbsp;northward movement in expenses on labor&nbsp;is hurting JetBlue&rsquo;s bottom line by pushing up operating costs. Operating expenses were up 1.2% in 2024, with expenses on salary, wages and benefits escalating 6.8%. Owing to the uptick in labor costs, management expects first-quarter 2025 CASM, excluding fuel and special items, to climb 8-10%. For 2025, CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is predicted to be up in the 5-7% range. Share price volatility is another concern.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>JetBlue&rsquo;s Zacks Rank</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">JBLU currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stocks to Consider</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the Zacks&nbsp;<strong>Transportation</strong>&nbsp;sector may consider<strong>&nbsp;Golar LNG&nbsp;Limited (</strong>GLNG<strong>) </strong>and<strong>&nbsp;SkyWest&nbsp;(</strong>SKYW<strong>).</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Golar LNG </strong>currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). GLNG has an expected earnings growth rate of 16.1% for the current year. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an average beat of 30.2%. Shares of GLNG have risen 88.9% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SkyWest </strong>currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected earnings growth rate of 16% for the current year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has an encouraging track record with respect to the earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters. The average beat is 16.7%. Shares of SKYW have climbed 68.3% in the past year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418865/here-s-why-investors-should-retain-jblu-stock-in-their-portfolio-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2418865">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Boston Beer Gears Up to Report Q4 Earnings: Here's What to Expect ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:59:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>The Boston Beer Company, Inc.</strong> SAM is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 25. In the fourth quarter, the company is anticipated to have registered bottom-line growth from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.</p><p><em><strong>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/a3/1740059822.png" title="" width="579" /> <p>The Boston Beer Company, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Boston Beer Company, Inc. Quote</p></div><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss per share is pegged at $1.18, suggesting an improvement from a loss per share of $1.49 reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for loss per share has widened in the past seven days. For quarterly revenues, the consensus estimate is pegged at $389.6 million, suggesting a 1.04% decline from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported number.</p><p>In the last reported quarter, SAM delivered an earnings beat of 7.9%. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 154.6%, on average.</p><h2>Factors Shaping SAM&rsquo;s Q4 Results</h2><p>Boston Beer is expected to have faced continued headwinds in the fourth quarter due to the ongoing slowdown in the hard seltzer category and weakening demand for its Truly brand. The declining trend in hard seltzers suggests&nbsp; pressure on depletions, particularly as consumer preferences shift toward other beyond-beer alternatives and premium light beers due to their lower pricing.<br /><br />The lack of novelty in the hard seltzer space, combined with increased competition from emerging beverage categories, may have weighed on Truly&rsquo;s performance. Additionally, macroeconomic challenges, including inflationary pressure and shift in discretionary spending, may have driven volume away from hard seltzers, impacting Boston Beer&rsquo;s overall sales mix.<br /><br />However, Boston Beer is well-positioned for improved performance in the quarter to be reported, driven by strong price realization and procurement savings, which continue to offset inflationary pressures. The company&rsquo;s ability to execute strategic pricing actions and optimize costs resulted in an expansion in gross margin, a trend that is expected to persist.<br /><br />SAM has been focused on strategic pricing, product innovation and brand development to strengthen its market position and drive operational performance. The company has been expanding its presence in the Beyond Beer category, which has been outpacing the traditional beer market. With sustained growth in this segment, SAM expects the trend to persist, further solidifying its competitive edge.</p><h2>What the Zacks Model Unveils for SAM Stock</h2><p>Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boston Beer this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />Boston Beer currently has an Earnings ESP of -24.19% and a Zacks Rank #3.</p><h2>Valuation Picture of SAM Stock</h2><p>From a valuation perspective, Boston Beer stock is trading at a premium relative to historical and industry benchmarks. With a forward 12-month price-to-earnings of 19.28x, below the Beverages - Soft drinks industry&rsquo;s average of 14.14x, the stock offers compelling value for investors seeking exposure to the sector.<br /><br />Boston Beer shares have shown a downward trend, falling 24.4% in the past three months compared with the industry&rsquo;s decline of 12.1%.</p><h3>SAM Stock&#39;s Performance in Past Three Months</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/52/94607.jpg?v=927727243" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Stocks With the Favorable Combination</h2><p>Here are some companies that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.<br /><br /><strong>Hormel Foods Corporation </strong>HRL currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues is pegged at $2.9 billion, indicating a 2% decline from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong><br /><br />The consensus estimate for HRL&rsquo;s first-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at 38 cents per share, implying a 7.3% decrease from the year-earlier quarter. The consensus mark has been stable in the past seven days.<br /><br /><strong>General Mills</strong> GIS currently has an Earnings ESP of +7.77% and a Zacks Rank #3. GIS is anticipated to register a decline in its top and bottom lines when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2025 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Mills&rsquo; quarterly revenues is pegged at $5.1 billion, indicating a decline of 0.8% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Mills&rsquo; bottom line has been stable in the past seven days at $1.03 per share. The consensus estimate for GIS suggests a decline of 12% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. GIS has delivered an earnings beat of 7.8%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.<br /><br /><strong>Grocery Outlet Holding</strong> GO currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.32% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is likely to register a decline in the bottom line when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings per share is pegged at 17 cents, down 5.6% from the year-ago period.<br /><br />Grocery Outlet&#39;s top line is expected to rise year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.09 billion, which suggests an increase of 9.7% from the prior-year quarter. GO has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 2.2%, on average.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418863/boston-beer-gears-up-to-report-q4-earnings-here-s-what-to-expect?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2418863">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Jobless Claims Increased More Than Expected ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">We have an informative and far-reaching morning of investment data ahead of today&rsquo;s opening bell, with Weekly Jobless Claims and Philly Fed manufacturing joining some key quarterly earnings reports. Pre-market indexes are once again starting off lower than the previous-day&rsquo;s close, but the S&amp;P 500 is working on a two-day record-closing-high streak.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Dow is currently -150 points at this hour, with the S&amp;P 500 -17. The Nasdaq has dropped -50 points currently, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -4 points. Bond yields remain steady but with a slight downward bias: the 10-year is currently at +4.511% and the 2-year is +4.257%.</p><h2>Weekly Jobless Claims Keeping Steady</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Initial Jobless Claims </strong>for last week came in slightly above estimates &mdash; 219K from 215K expected &mdash; and up from the slightly upwardly revised 214K from the prior week. Still, it&rsquo;s the third week of the last four sub-220K; this is not a terribly meaningful threshold, more just a round number. We had a one-week outlier at +260K new claims the first week in October of last year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Continuing Claims </strong>also stayed range-bound: 1.869 million, while notably ahead of where longer-term claims were a year ago (sub-1.8 million), is the fourth-straight week below 1.9 million. Again, this is not a key threshold &mdash; that would be 2 million longer-term jobless claims per month. We haven&rsquo;t been there since the first week of November 2021, and multitudes lower than the Covid-era layoff nightmare.</p><h2>Philly Fed Notches 2nd-Best Level of the Year</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The latest manufacturing survey for the sixth-largest city in the U.S. &mdash; the <strong>Philly Fed </strong>index &mdash; came in at +18.1 for the month of February this morning, above expectations for +13.2. This follows the strongest monthly headline in this metric, +44.3, which was the highest level we&rsquo;ve seen since April of 2021. This index demonstrated the highest prices paid in two years. As we&rsquo;ve seen elsewhere, this is bad news for the Fed lowering interest rates, but good for the economy at large.</p><h2>Quarterly Earnings Roundup: WMT, BABA &amp; More</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Walmart </strong>(WMT) posted Q4 earnings ahead of today&rsquo;s open, outpacing estimates on the bottom line by a penny &mdash; 66 cents per share versus 65 expected &mdash; on a truly breathtaking $180.55 billion in sales over the three-month period. However, guidance was for trimming sales expectations, as the company does not believe it will be immune from new tariff policy on imported goods from China. Shares were down -6% on the news. For more on WMT&rsquo;s earnings. click here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Alibaba </strong>(BABA) shares, on the other hand, are up +12% this morning following fiscal Q3 earnings hitting the tape: earnings of $2.93 per ADS was shy of the $3.08 in the Zacks consensus, but revenues of $38.6 billion were ahead of the $38.2 billion projected. The bigger news here may be the shift in policy from China&rsquo;s leaders, signaling an end to the crackdown on major companies in Chinese tech, like BABA.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TripAdvisor (</strong>TRIP) saw another good quarter this morning, with Q4 earnings coming in at 30 cents per share as opposed to the expected 21 cents (though off the year-ago level of 38 cents per share a year ago). Revenues of $411 million outpaced estimates by +2.6%. TRIP shares have gained almost +20% year to date, but market participants are selling the news -2.5%. Will American travel keep up its lofty levels? That&rsquo;s the question.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Wayfair </strong>(W), however, saw a big -1350% earnings miss for its Q4 bottom line this morning, posting -$0.02 per share versus projections for +$0.25. Revenues beat estimates by +1.73% to $3.12 billion in the quarter, and this turnaround in sales growth is generating interest in the stock, which is now up +8.5% in pre-market trading.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418849/jobless-claims-increased-more-than-expected?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-economic_highlights-2418849">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Koninklijke Philips N.V.</strong> PHG reported a loss of &euro;0.36 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2024, which declined from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure of &euro;0.04 per share.<br /><br /><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong><br /><br />The company&rsquo;s sales decreased 0.4% on a year-over-year basis to &euro;5 billion.<br /><br />Comparable sales grew 1% year over year, driven by an increase in the Connected Care segment. Comparable sales in the Diagnosis &amp; Treatment and Personal Health segments declined due to weaker demand from consumers and health systems in China.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Koninklijke Philips N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/a4/1740058835.png" title="" width="568" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Koninklijke Philips N.V. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Koninklijke Philips N.V. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Further, Philips&rsquo; comparable order intake increased 2% year over year in the reported quarter despite a double-digit decline in China.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sales declined 9% year over year on a comparable basis in growth geographies. Sales in mature geographies showed mid-single-digit growth with strong contributions from all regions.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PHG&rsquo;s Segmental Update</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Diagnosis &amp; Treatment revenues declined 2.3% year over year from the year-ago quarter to &euro;2.44 billion. Comparable sales declined 1% year over year, primarily due to a double-digit drop in China, which outweighed strong growth in other regions. While Image Guided Therapy saw solid growth, it was offset by a decline in Precision Diagnosis.<br /><br />Connected Care revenues increased 5.4% year over year to &euro;1.42 billion. Comparable sales grew 7% from the year-ago quarter, benefiting from a low comparison base due to a sales provision recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 for the Respironics recall remediation.<br /><br />Personal Health revenues fell 3.9% year over year to &euro;1.02 billion. Comparable sales declined 2% year over year, primarily driven by a double-digit drop in China due to weakened consumer sentiment.<br /><br />Other segment sales amounted to &euro;151 million, up 7.1% on a year-over-year basis.&nbsp;<br /><br />Philips continued to lead the market with AI-driven innovations across its product offerings. More than 50% of its sales in the fourth quarter of 2024 came from products launched in the past three years, showcasing its commitment to new technologies and upgrades.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PHG&rsquo;s Operating Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Gross margin expanded 340 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 38.9% in the reported quarter.<br /><br />General &amp; administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 2.7%, which contracted 10 bps on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, selling expenses contracted 50 bps to 23.6%. Research &amp; development expenses increased 50 bps to 9.4%.<br /><br />Restructuring, acquisition-related and other items amounted to a net gain of &euro;286 million compared with &euro;548 million a year ago.<br /><br />Operating model productivity, procurement and other productivity programs delivered savings of &euro;47 million, &euro;56 million and &euro;59 million, respectively. This resulted in total savings of &euro;163 million.<br /><br />Phillips&rsquo; adjusted EBITA &mdash; the company&rsquo;s preferred measure of operational performance &mdash; rose 4% year over year to &euro;679 million. EBITA margin expanded 60 bps on a year-over-year basis to 13.5% in the reported quarter.<br /><br />Diagnosis &amp; Treatment&rsquo;s adjusted EBITA margin expanded 160 bps on a year-over-year basis to 12.1%.<br /><br />Connected Care&rsquo;s adjusted EBITA margin was 15% in the reported quarter, which remained flat year over year.<br /><br />Personal Health&rsquo;s adjusted EBITA margin contracted 190 bps on a year-over-year basis to 18%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PHG&rsquo;s Balance Sheet</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, Philips&rsquo; cash and cash equivalents were &euro;2.4 billion compared with &euro;1.5 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024.&nbsp;<br /><br />Total debt was &euro;7.639 billion compared with &euro;8.032 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024.<br /><br />Operating cash inflow was &euro;1.4 billion against the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s operating cash flow of &euro;1.3 billion.<br /><br />In the quarter under review, free cash flow was &euro;1.2 billion compared with the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s &euro;1.1 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PHG Initiates Weak 2025 Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Philips stock has lost 0.5% year to date against the Zacks Medical sector&rsquo;s growth of 4.5%. A significant decline in demand from China has led to lowered guidance for 2025. These factors may also put downward pressure on PHG&rsquo;s shares.<br /><br />Philips expects to deliver 1-3% of comparable sales growth.<br /><br />Further, adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be 30-80 bps to 11.8%-12.3%<br /><br />Free cash flow before payment of the $1.1 billion cash-out relating to the US medical monitoring and personal injury settlements will be at the lower end of the range of &euro;1.4 billion-&euro;1.6 billion. Net of this cash-out, free cash flow is likely to be in the range of&nbsp; &euro;0.4 billion-&euro;0.6 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PHG&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Philips currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).<br /><br /><strong>BWX Technologies</strong> BWXT, <strong>Salesforce</strong> CRM and <strong>Cogent Communications</strong> CCOI are some better-ranked stocks that investors can consider in the broader sector.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Navitas Semiconductor</strong> NVTS is set to release its fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 24.<br /><br /><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong><br /><br />For the fourth quarter of 2024, net revenues are expected to be between $18 million and $20 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $19.13 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 26.59%.&nbsp;<br /><br />The consensus mark for loss is pegged at 6 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, which remained unchanged over the past 30 days. NVTS reported earnings of 4 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Navitas Semiconductor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Navitas Semiconductor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/77/1740061451.png" style="width: 620px; height: 210px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Navitas Semiconductor Corporation price-eps-surprise | Navitas Semiconductor Corporation Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">NVTS&rsquo; earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, missing in one and beating in the remaining one, the average negative surprise being 7.5%.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Key Factors to Note for NVTS Earnings</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Navitas&rsquo; fourth-quarter performance has benefited from its three key markets, which include AI data centers, mobile and electric vehicles (EVs). These markets are anticipated to have driven substantial revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.<br /><br />Navitas has a robust customer pipeline valued at over $1.6 billion, with numerous design wins across multiple sectors. This strong pipeline is expected to have driven continued demand for the company&rsquo;s GaN and silicon carbide solutions, particularly in AI, mobile, EVs, and solar energy, in the fourth quarter.<br /><br />Navitas mobile business saw a record performance in the third quarter of 2024, and this momentum is anticipated to have continued in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well. Growth in mobile is expected to help offset challenges in other areas, providing stable revenues for the company. The increasing adoption of GaN technology in mobile fast chargers remains a key growth driver.<br /><br />However, the dynamic nature and short lead times for the mobile business and the customer project delays are expected to have hurt NVTS&rsquo; top line in the to-be-reported quarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />The company has also been suffering from a challenging macroeconomic environment, with continued softness in some of the end markets. An unfavorable product mix might have hurt the fourth quarter of 2024 gross margin, which is expected to be 40% (+/- 50 basis points).</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">NVTS Trading at a Premium</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Navitas shares have plunged 49.8% in the trailing 12-month period against the Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector&rsquo;s 26.3% return and the Zacks Electronics Semiconductors industry&rsquo;s appreciation of 55.5%.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">NVTS Underperforms Sector, Industry</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b0/94620.jpg?v=242118753" style="height: 210px; width: 620px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of this gallium nitride (GaN) power ICs and silicon carbide (SiC) technology provider have underperformed industry peers, including <strong>Broadcom</strong> AVGO and <strong>Credo Technology</strong> CRDO, in the trailing 12-month period. Shares of Broadcom and Credo have appreciated 85.3% and 226.7%, respectively, over the same time frame.<br /><br />The Navitas stock is also not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.<br /><br />NVTS stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 6.92X compared with the sector&rsquo;s 6.62X.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price/Sales (F12M)</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a2/94621.jpg?v=363115112" style="height: 210px; width: 620px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Navitas and Infineon Partner to Boost GaN Adoption</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the third quarter of 2024, Navitas announced a strategic partnership with <strong>Infineon</strong> IFNNY to align on common GaN specifications, allowing customers to dual-source GaN components.<br /><br />This collaboration with Infenion is expected to accelerate GaN adoption in high-volume markets like data centers, EVs, and power electronics, providing customers with increased confidence in supply chain stability.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Cost Reduction Plan to Aid NVTS&rsquo; Profitability</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Navitas&rsquo; cost-reduction plan is expected to save $2 million per quarter and streamline the enterprise with an increased focus on Al data centers, EVs and mobile applications. The company&rsquo;s plan includes a 14% reduction in headcount.<br /><br />Adjusted operating expenses are expected to decline by roughly $20.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024.&nbsp;<br /><br />Navitas expects to realize the full benefit of the cost savings in the first half of 2025, which is expected to help the company generate profit.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Navitas&rsquo; Prospects Ride on Expanding Portfolio</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Navitas&rsquo; expanding portfolio is a major driver in the GaN and SiC market, which is currently worth more than $22 billion. Its strong portfolio of more than 300 patents (issued or pending) across GaN power circuitry, analog and digital integration, and SiC device design and fabrication is noteworthy.<br /><br />Through its latest GaNSafe family, NVTS is expanding its power capabilities into AI data centers, EV chargers and next-generation solar microinverters.&nbsp;<br /><br />The launch of a new low-voltage GaN technology optimized for 48-volt systems is noteworthy. It gives Navitas more content and complete solutions for AI data centers and next-generation EV platforms and opens up new markets like AI-based robotics.<br /><br />The company believes this new 80-volt to 200-volt range creates an additional $1 billion market opportunity in the future.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">NVTS: Smart Buy or Risky Bet</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the challenging macroeconomic environment, Navitas&rsquo; prospects remain cloudy in the near term. Unfavorable revenue mix due to high mobile content is expected to keep gross margin under pressure. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.<br /><br />Navitas currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which implies that investors should wait for a favorable time to accumulate the stock.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Louisiana-Pacific Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s LPX, or LP, reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and net sales beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. This was driven by robust demand in its Siding segment and disciplined capital management. The metrics also increased on a year-over-year basis. Despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, the company&rsquo;s strategic execution and operational efficiency helped offset pressures from a declining Oriented Strand Board (OSB) market.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em><br /><br />The company delivered a strong 2024, driven by Siding segment expansion and disciplined capital management. While OSB pricing remains a wildcard, the company&rsquo;s strategic focus on higher-margin products and share repurchases positions it well for sustained earnings growth in 2025.<br /><br />Yet, shares lost more than 10.1% yesterday during the trading session, most probably because of challenges such as housing market softness, potential tariffs, and inflation.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Louisiana-Pacific Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Louisiana-Pacific Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/52/1740057667.png" title="" width="579" /> <p>Louisiana-Pacific Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Louisiana-Pacific Corporation Quote</p></div><h2>Louisiana-Pacific&rsquo;s Quarterly Earnings &amp; Revenue Discussion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Louisiana-Pacific reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.03, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents by 30.4%. The bottom line increased 45.1% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s figure of 71 cents.<br /><br />Net sales of $681 million topped the consensus estimate of $664 million by 2.5% and grew 3.5% from the prior-year figure.<br /><br />Adjusted EBITDA of $125 million was down 3.1% from the prior-year quarter. The slight downturn was primarily attributed to pricing pressures in the OSB segment, partially offset by strong performance in the Siding segment and cost discipline in Latin America.</p><h2>Segmental Analysis of LPX&rsquo;s Q4 Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Siding</strong>: The segment&rsquo;s sales of $362 million increased 9% from the prior-year period, supported by a 3% rise in volume and a 6% increase in average selling prices.<br /><br />The Siding segment maintained its profitability, posting an adjusted EBITDA of $72 million, inching up 1% from the year-ago level. However, EBITDA growth was limited by higher sales and marketing expenses and maintenance costs at the company&rsquo;s Houlton, ME, facility.<br /><br /><strong>OSB</strong>: Sales in the segment decreased 2% year over year to $267 million, owing to a 7% decline in OSB prices, partially offset by 6% higher volumes. Also, flat shipments in OSB-Structural Solutions were offset by 12% growth in OSB-Commodity.<br /><br />The segment&rsquo;s adjusted EBITDA plunged 15% year over year to $50 million due to lower OSB prices.<br /><br /><strong>LP South America (LPSA)</strong>: Sales of $50 million declined 5% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA, however, increased 16% from the year-ago quarter to $13 million. This improvement was largely due to cost management and efficiency gains, which offset weaker pricing and unfavorable foreign currency impacts.</p><h2>LPX&rsquo;s 2024 Highlights</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s adjusted EPS came in at $5.88, up 82.6% from $3.22 in 2023. Total revenues were $2.9 billion, up 14% from 2023.<br /><br />LPX&rsquo;s success in 2024 was primarily driven by its Siding business, which performed well despite broader market headwinds. The segment recorded a 17% jump for the year, outperforming the broader market. While U.S. housing starts declined 4% for the year and 6% in the fourth quarter, single-family housing&mdash;where LPX is heavily indexed&mdash;remained more resilient, experiencing a 7% increase in starts for the year. With an EBITDA margin of 25% for the full year, the Siding segment hit its long-term margin target despite softness in the repair and remodel (R&amp;R) market.<br /><br />While OSB prices were slightly higher than in 2023, the segment faced a tougher pricing environment in the fourth quarter. LPX responded by focusing on operational efficiency, disciplined capacity management, and cost controls. The company also emphasized growth in Structural Solutions, its higher-margin OSB product line. These efforts helped mitigate the impact of lower OSB prices, with the segment achieving EBITDA above its long-term cycle average.</p><h2>Louisiana-Pacific&rsquo;s Toll Brothers&rsquo; Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">At 2024-end, Louisiana-Pacific had $900 million in liquidity. As of Dec. 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $340 million, up from $222 million in 2023-end. Long-term debt was $348 million, which aligned with the 2023-end level.<br /><br />In 2024, net cash provided by operations was $605 million, up significantly from $316 million a year ago.<br /><br />During 2024, LPX repurchased 2.4 million of its common shares for a total of $212 million. As of 2024-end, about $238 million remained under the pre-existing share repurchase authorizations. The company paid $74 million in cash dividends.</p><h2>LPX&rsquo;s Q1 2025 Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">LPX expects a healthy start to the year, particularly in Siding, where it forecasts first-quarter revenue growth of 9% to 11%, reaching $390 million to $400 million. The company attributes this to a solid order pipeline and a seasonal rebound in demand. With full realization of its annual list price increases, LPX anticipates Siding EBITDA for the quarter to be between $95 million and $105 million, keeping the segment&rsquo;s EBITDA margin in line with its long-term target of 25%.<br /><br />For OSB, LPX assumes pricing stability at current levels and projects first-quarter EBITDA within the $35 million to $45 million range. However, as broader market conditions influence OSB prices, the company remains flexible in its planning.<br /><br />Total adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $130 million and $150 million.</p><h2>What LPX Expects for Fiscal 2025</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For the full year, LPX anticipates Siding revenue to increase between 7% and 9%, reaching a range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion. The company also forecasts Siding EBITDA of $415 million to $425 million, maintaining its EBITDA margin at approximately 25%.<br /><br />For the OSB segment, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $200 million and $210 million. For 2025, LPX expects another year of strategic execution in OSB, anticipating a flat housing market but a potential modest rebound in R&amp;R spending. The company aims to maintain cost discipline while continuing to expand its Structural Solutions offerings.<br /><br />Consolidated adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $615 million and $635 million.<br /><br />Capital expenditures reached $183 million in 2024, with plans to increase investment to approximately $410 million in 2025, signaling confidence in future growth.</p><h2>Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Louisiana-Pacific currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>UFP Industries, Inc.</strong> UFPI reported mixed fourth-quarter 2024 results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues beat the same. Both metrics declined year over year.<br /><br />UFP Industries&rsquo; quarterly results were affected by softer demand and broad-based pricing pressures. While economic challenges are expected to persist in 2025, the company remains confident that its balanced business model, variable incentive-compensation structure and ongoing growth initiatives will support continued success.<br /><br /><strong>Weyerhaeuser Company</strong> WY reported mixed results for the fourth quarter of 2024. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while net sales missed the same. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics declined due to lower fee harvest volumes in the West.<br /><br />For first-quarter 2025, for Timberland, Weyerhaeuser expects earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $20 million higher than the fourth quarter. In the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment, Weyerhaeuser expects first-quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable sequentially. Within the Wood Products segment, WY expects its first-quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA to slightly exceed fourth-quarter levels.<br /><br /><strong>PulteGroup Inc.</strong> PHM has reported remarkable fourth-quarter 2024 results, wherein adjusted earnings and total revenues handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. The quarter&rsquo;s result reflects the company&rsquo;s success in addressing the affordability issues of the housing market due to a still high mortgage rate.<br /><br />By implementing several operational changes, including targeted sales incentives and faster construction cycle times, PulteGroup was able to drive its home sales and foster new orders. Also, the increase in the average selling price of homes closed aided the quarter&rsquo;s top-line growth. In 2024, PHM invested about $5.3 billion into its business, returned $1.4 billion to its shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends and generated a return on equity of 27.5%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418844/louisiana-pacific-q4-earnings-net-sales-top-estimates-stock-down?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418844">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cintas Corporation</strong> CTAS is well-poised to benefit from strength across its business, acquisitions, focus on improving the product line and operational excellence. The company remains focused on investing in growth opportunities and solidifying its long-term market position.<br /><br />CTAS has a market capitalization of $84 billion. In the year-to-date period, it has gained 11.8% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 9.3% growth. CTAS currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">YTD Price Performance of CTAS</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/0e/94604.jpg?v=1642217638" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Favoring Cintas</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Business Strength</strong>: Cintas has been experiencing strength in its Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment, driven by strong growth in new customers and penetration of additional products and services into existing customers. The segment&rsquo;s revenues rose 7.5% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended November 2024).<br /><br />Increasing demand for AED Rentals, eyewash stations and WaterBreak products is boosting the First Aid and Safety Services segment&rsquo;s performance. Revenues from the segment climbed 12.4% year over year in the fiscal second quarter.<br /><br />Driven by strength across its businesses, Cintas has provided a bullish forecast for fiscal 2025. The company expects revenues to be in the range of $10.255-$10.32 billion, higher than the earlier predicted band of $10.22-$10.32 billion. The mid-point of the guidance, $10.28 billion, indicates year-over-year growth of 7.1%.<br /><br /><strong>Acquisition Benefits</strong>: The company remains focused on acquiring businesses to gain access to new customers and product lines. CTAS&rsquo; acquisition of Paris Uniform Services (in March 2024) boosted its presence in Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland and West Virginia. Also, the buyout of SITEX (in February 2024) has strengthened its market position in the central Midwest region. In fiscal 2024 (ended May 2024), acquisitions boosted revenue growth by 0.4%.<br /><br /><strong>Business Initiatives</strong>: Cintas&#39; focus on the enhancement of its product portfolio, along with investments in technology and automation to improve efficiencies in existing facilities, should continue to drive its performance. For instance, the company&rsquo;s investment in SmartTruck technology continues to provide route optimization and improved efficiencies. Also, it has been investing in garment-sharing technology and SAP systems for a while now.<br /><br /><strong>Shareholder-Friendly Policies</strong>: It remains committed to rewarding its shareholders through dividend payouts and share buybacks. In the first six months of fiscal 2025, the company paid dividends worth $295.6 million, up approximately 15.5% year over year. The amount spent on share buybacks totaled $651.5 million compared with $423.1 million in the year-ago period.<br /><br />Also, in fiscal 2024, dividend payments totaled $530.9 million, up 18% year over year. Cintas repurchased shares worth $700 million in the same period, up 75.5% year over year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Other top-ranked companies are discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>RBC Bearings</strong> RBC presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 5%. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for RBC&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 (ending March 2025) earnings has increased 1%.<br /><br /><strong>SPS Commerce</strong> SPSC currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. SPSC delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 9.1%.<br /><br />In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for SPS Commerce&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has decreased 2%.<br /><br /><strong>Applied Industrial Technologies</strong> AIT presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. AIT delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 5.3%.<br /><br />In the past 60 days, the consensus estimate for AIT&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings has inched up 1.1%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418840/here-s-why-you-should-consider-investing-in-cintas-stock-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2418840">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Etsy, Inc.

Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ETSY&rsquo;s Top-Line Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Marketplace revenues were $607.3 million (71.3% of the total revenues), down 1.4% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level. The decline was due to lower gross merchandise sales (GMS), which put pressure on transaction revenues. It was partially offset by higher consolidated payments revenues and revenue from the new seller onboarding fee.<br /><br />ETSY acquired 6.9 million new buyers, and the total number of active buyers on Etsy&rsquo;s marketplace were 89.6 million, which decreased 2.6% year over year.<br /><br />Services revenues were $244.8 million (28.7% of the total revenues), up 8.1% on a year-over-year basis.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ETSY&rsquo;s Active User Base and GMS Decrease Y/Y</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Etsy&rsquo;s active buyer base decreased 1.1% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s figure to 95.5 million, which missed the consensus mark of 96.7 million.<br /><br />The active seller base was pinned at 8.1 million, down 10% year over year. The figure missed the consensus mark of 9.6 million.<br /><br />ETSY witnessed solid momentum in buyer reactivation. Reactivated buyers were a record 9.8 million, up 1.3% year over year.<br /><br />GMS of $3.74 billion was down 6.8% on a reported basis and 6.9% on a currency-neutral basis from the prior-year quarter. The reported figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.86 billion.<br /><br />The Etsy marketplace&rsquo;s GMS was $3.3 billion, down 8.6% year over year. This decline was due to challenging year-over-year comparisons in a shortened holiday season, category mix, a highly promotional and competitive retail environment and pressure on consumer discretionary product selling.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ETSY&rsquo;s Operating Expenses Rise Y/Y</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the fourth quarter of 2024, total operating expenses were $479.34 million, up 1.7% from the prior-year quarter. As a percentage of revenues, the figure contracted to 56.25% from 58.9% in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />Marketing expenses increased 9.2% year over year to $285.2 million. As a percentage of sales, marketing expenses increased 251 basis points (bps) year over year to 33.5%.<br /><br />Product development expenses decreased 5.1% year over year to $111.5 million. As a percentage of sales, product development expenses decreased 86 bps year over year to 13.08%.&nbsp;<br /><br />General and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses decreased 10.6% year over year to $82.7 million. As a percentage of sales, G&amp;A expenses decreased by 120 bps to 9.7%.<br /><br />Consequently, ETSY reported an operating income of $155.1 million compared with an operating income of $115.5 million reported in the prior-year quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ETSY&rsquo;s Balance Sheet</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $811.18 million, which decreased from $818.94 million as of Sept. 30, 2024.<br /><br />Short-term investments were $228.32 million, up from $226.02 million in the previous quarter.<br /><br />Long-term debt was $2.29 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, unchanged from the figure reported at the end of the prior quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ETSY&rsquo;s Q1 2025 Guidance Unimpressive</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For the first quarter of 2025, Etsy anticipates the take rate to be 23%. GMS is expected to decline at a rate similar to the year-over-year performance reported for the fourth quarter of 2024.&nbsp;<br /><br />The adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 25-26%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, Etsy carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).<br /><br />Some better-ranked stocks in the broader sector are <strong>Bath and Body Works</strong> BBWI, <strong>Beacon Roofing Supply </strong>BECN and <strong>Cars.com </strong>CARS, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Amicus Therapeutics</strong> FOLD reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of 9 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents. The company had reported earnings of 1 cent per share in the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues in the fourth quarter totaled $149.7 million, up 30% year over year on a reported basis and a constant-currency (cc) basis. The figure marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $149 million. The top line comprised sales of Galafold (migalastat), which is approved for Fabry disease and the newly approved combo drug, Pombiliti + Opfolda.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The FDA approved Pombiliti + Opfolda, a two-component therapy for treating late-onset Pompe disease, in September 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The top-line increased year over year owing to higher revenues from Galafold sales and incremental revenues from the sale of Pombiliti + Opfolda. Both Fabry disease and Pompe disease are rare diseases. Amicus is currently advancing ongoing studies to broaden labels in Fabry and Pompe diseases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past year, shares of Amicus have plunged 29.5% compared with the industry&rsquo;s decline of 8.1%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1f/94597.jpg?v=1093353416" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">More on FOLD&#39;s Q4 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the fourth quarter, Galafold sales were $127.5 million, up 20% year over year at cc, driven by continued strong demand. However, Galafold sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $141 million and also our model estimate of $127.7 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Weaker-than-expected Galafold sales could be the reason for the stock price to decline 2.9% on Feb. 19.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Net product sales of Pombiliti + Opfolda were $22.2 million, reflecting sequential growth of 5.2%. The figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.3 million and was in-line with our model estimate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per Amicus, as of the end of 2024, almost 220 patients were treated or are scheduled to be treated with the combo drug in five markets (the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Austria).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, Amicus had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities worth $249.9 million compared with $249.8 million as of Sept. 30, 2024.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">FOLD&#39;s Full-Year Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2024, Amicus generated revenues of $528.3 million, reflecting a 33% increase year over year at cc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the same period, the company reported adjusted earnings of 24 cents per share against a loss of 13 cents per share reported in the year-ago period.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">FOLD&#39;s 2025 Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reiterated its total revenue guidance for 2025, which it had provided last month.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For full-year 2025, management expects total revenues to grow in the range of 17%-24% on a constant exchange rate (CER).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues from Galafold are expected to grow in the range of 10%-15% at CER in 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company expects Pombiliti + Opfolda revenue growth of 65%-85% at CER.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total adjusted operating expenses are expected in the band of $350-$370 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Amicus expects to achieve positive GAAP net income in the second half of 2025. The company expects to exceed $1 billion in total sales in 2028.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">FOLD Settles Galafold Patent Litigation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In October 2024, Amicus signed a licensing agreement with <strong>Teva Pharmaceuticals</strong> TEVA, resolving the patent lawsuit that it had filed earlier.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The litigation arose after Teva submitted an abbreviated new drug application seeking approval to sell a generic version of Amicus&#39; Galafold 123 mg capsules before the related patents expired.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per the settlement terms, TEVA will not be able to sell its generic version of Galafold in the United States until January 2037.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The agreement also ended all ongoing litigation between Amicus and Teva concerning Galafold patents in the U.S. District Court for Delaware.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Amicus Therapeutics, Inc.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>RTX Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s RTX unit, Pratt &amp; Whitney, recently announced its plans to enhance its global network of GTF engines&rsquo; maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) by partnering with Sanad Group. As part of this collaboration, a new state-of-the-art MRO facility will be established in Al Ain, UAE, which should further fortify RTX&rsquo;s presence in the region.</p><h2>Details of RTX&rsquo;s Facility</h2><p>The new MRO facility is set to be operational by 2028.

The new GTF maintenance center in Abu Dhabi will be the first in the South Asia, Middle East and North Africa region.</p><h2>RTX&rsquo;s Expertise in the MRO Market</h2><p>Rising commercial air traffic worldwide in recent times has been significantly boosting the demand for aircraft, thereby driving the need for MRO services. With airlines expanding their fleet to accommodate growing passenger volumes, the demand for MRO services is also growing.<br /><br />This must have led the Market Research Future firm to predict that the global commercial aircraft MRO market will witness a CAGR of 4.3% during the 2024-2032 period.<br /><br />Notably RTX, through its Pratt &amp; Whitney unit, offers maintenance and support for commercial aircraft engines. Its GTF MRO network now includes 20 shops across four continents.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s Collins Aerospace unit is also a well-known provider of aircraft MRO services. In October 2024, this unit signed a 10-year contract with Air Europa to provide comprehensive MRO services for the airline&#39;s fleet of 787 aircraft.</p><h2>Opportunities for Other Companies</h2><p>Other companies from the same sector that are anticipated to benefit from the expanding aircraft MRO market are discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Heico</strong> HEI: Its Flight Support Group repairs, overhauls and distributes jet engine and aircraft components, avionics and instruments for domestic and foreign commercial air carriers and aircraft repair companies.<br /><br />Heico has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 17.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HEI&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 9.1%.<br /><br /><strong>Airbus Group</strong> EADSY: The company&rsquo;s Airbus Services has a dedicated organization that has been created to deliver world-class and fully integrated aviation services to MRO organizations. Airbus collaborates with best-in-class MROs to provide end-to-end airframe maintenance services around the world.<br /><br />Airbus Group has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EADSY&rsquo;s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 9.7%.<br /><br /><strong>The Boeing Company</strong> BA: It offers extensive MRO services through its Global Services division, supporting both military and commercial aircraft. These services are available at several locations around the world, including China, Ireland, the UK and the USA.<br /><br />The company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 17.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA&rsquo;s 2025 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 25.4%.</p><h2>RTX Stock&rsquo;s Price Movement</h2><p>Shares of RTX have gained 7.5% in the past six months against the industry&rsquo;s 7.4% decline.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7c/94598.jpg?v=849378695" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>RTX Stock&rsquo;s Zacks Rank</h2><p>RTX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Devon Energy Corp. </strong>DVN reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.16, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1 by 16%.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em><br /><br />GAAP EPS in the reported quarter was 98 cents compared with $1.81 in the year-ago quarter. The difference between GAAP and operating earnings in the fourth quarter was due to an impact of 17 cents from fair value changes in financial instruments, 1 cent from deferred tax asset valuation allowance,1 cent from asset and exploration impairments, and 1 cent gain from asset dispositions.<br /><br />Adjusted earnings in 2024 were $4.82 per share compared with $5.71 in 2023.</p><h2>Revenues of DVN</h2><p>Total revenues for the quarter were $4.4 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.23 billion by 3.9%. Strong production volumes from the Delaware Basin boosted performance, marginally offset by the drop in realized prices of the commodities. The top line increased 6.2% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s figure.<br /><br />Total revenues in 2024 were $15.94 billion compared with $15.26 billion in 2023.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Devon Energy Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Devon Energy Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/79/1740057078.png" style="width: 600px; height: 313px;" title="" /> </p><p>Devon Energy Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Devon Energy Corporation Quote</p></div><h2>Production of DVN</h2><p>Net production in the fourth quarter totaled 848,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d), up 28.1% year over year. Actual production volume exceeded the guided range of 811,000-830,000 Boe/d. Strong performance from the Delaware Basin and Powder River Basin boosted year-over-year production volumes. The contribution from Eagle Ford and Anadarko Basin also boosted production volumes in the reported quarter.<br /><br />Natural gas liquids production increased 30.8% year over year to 221,000 barrels per day (Bbl/d). Oil production amounted to 398,000 Bbl/d, up 25.5% on a year-over-year basis, attributed to a strong contribution from the Rockies region.</p><h2>DVN&rsquo;s Realized Prices</h2><p>Realized oil prices (including cash settlements) for the quarter were $69.19 per barrel, down 10.1% from $76.98 a year ago. Realized prices for natural gas liquids were $21.01 per barrel, up 6.8% from $19.67 in the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />Realized gas prices were $1.46 per thousand cubic feet, indicating a 27.7% decline from $2.02 a year ago.<br /><br />Total oil equivalent realized prices, including cash settlements, were $40.32 per Boe, down nearly 10.5% year over year.</p><h2>Highlights of DVN&rsquo;s Q4 Release</h2><p>The company achieved a 154% proven reserve replacement ratio in 2024.<br /><br />Total production expenses in fourth-quarter 2024 were $881 million, up 16.1% year over year.<br /><br />Devon repurchased shares worth $301 million in the fourth quarter and paid dividends worth $144 million to its shareholders. Management approved a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend for first-quarter 2025, the new quarterly rate will be 24 cents.<br /><br />Production costs, including taxes, averaged $11.30 per Boe in the fourth quarter, a decline of 1% from the prior period. Effective cost management efforts and lower well workovers drove per-unit rates 10% below from the guidance for the quarter.<br /><br />Devon Energy&rsquo;s realized price during the period, including commodity hedges, was $40.32 per Boe, down $4.75 from the year-ago quarter. The decreased price realization largely reflected lower crude benchmark prices, partially offset by higher NGL and natural gas prices.</p><h2>Other Events Post DVN&rsquo;s Q4</h2><p>On Jan. 22, 2025, Devon entered into an extension agreement with Dow to jointly develop a portion of the former&rsquo;s Anadarko acreage in central Oklahoma. Under this agreement, Devon will monetize half of its working interest in 49 undrilled locations in exchange for approximately a $40 million drilling carry.<br /><br />On Jan. 31, 2025, Devon and BPX, its partner in the Blackhawk Field in the Eagle Ford, agreed to dissolve the partnership within the play. The transaction is expected to close on April 1, 2025. Devon will gain greater flexibility to allocate capital and anticipates material drilling &amp; completion savings per well, significantly enhancing returns.</p><h2>Financial Highlights of DVN</h2><p>As of Dec. 31, 2024, the company had cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) of $846 million compared with $875 million as of Dec. 31, 2023.<br /><br />As of Dec. 31, 2024, long-term debt amounted to $8.39 billion, up from $5.67 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023.<br /><br />Devon&rsquo;s net cash from operating activities was $6.6 billion in 2024 compared with $6.54 billion in 2023. Capital expenditures in 2024 totaled $3.64 million, down 52% from $3.88 billion in 2023.</p><h2>Devon&rsquo;s Guidance</h2><p>First-quarter production is expected in the range of 805,000-825,000 Boe per day and capital spending is estimated in the band of $0.98-$1.04 billion.<br />&nbsp;<br />Production volume in 2025 is expected in the range of 805,000-825,000 Boe per day and capital spending is estimated in the band of $3.8-$4 billion. Production volume includes expected production of 380,000-386,000 barrels of oil per day.</p><h2>Devon&rsquo;s Zacks Rank</h2><p>Devon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).<br /><br />You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><h2>Recent Releases</h2><p><strong>TotalEnergies SE</strong> TTE reported fourth-quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.90 (&euro;1.78) per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.87 by 1.6%.

<![CDATA[ Steady Jobless Claims, Good Philly Fed, Healthy Q4 Earnings ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:31:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Thursday, February 20, 2025</strong><br /><br />We have an informative and far-reaching morning of investment data ahead of today&rsquo;s opening bell, with Weekly Jobless Claims and Philly Fed manufacturing joining some key quarterly earnings reports. Pre-market indexes are once again starting off lower than the previous-day&rsquo;s close, but the S&amp;P 500 is working on a two-day record-closing-high streak.<br /><br />The Dow is currently -150 points at this hour, with the S&amp;P 500 -17. The Nasdaq has dropped -50 points currently, and the small-cap Russell 2000 is -4 points. Bond yields remain steady but with a slight downward bias: the 10-year is currently at +4.511% and the 2-year is +4.257%.<br /><br /><h2>Weekly Jobless Claims Keeping Steady<br /></h2><br /><strong>Initial Jobless Claims</strong> for last week came in slightly above estimates &mdash; 219K from 215K expected &mdash; and up from the slightly upwardly revised 214K from the prior week. Still, it&rsquo;s the third week of the last four sub-220K; this is not a terribly meaningful threshold, more just a round number. We had a one-week outlier at +260K new claims the first week in October of last year.<br /><br /><strong>Continuing Claims </strong>also stayed range-bound: 1.869 million, while notably ahead of where longer-term claims were a year ago (sub-1.8 million), is the fourth-straight week below 1.9 million. Again, this is not a key threshold &mdash; that would be 2 million longer-term jobless claims per month. We haven&rsquo;t been there since the first week of November 2021, and multitudes lower than the Covid-era layoff nightmare.<br /><br /><h2>Philly Fed Notches 2nd-Best Level of the Year<br /></h2><br />The latest manufacturing survey for the sixth-largest city in the U.S. &mdash; the <strong>Philly Fed</strong> index &mdash; came in at +18.1 for the month of February this morning, above expectations for +13.2. This follows the strongest monthly headline in this metric, +44.3, which was the highest level we&rsquo;ve seen since April of 2021. This index demonstrated the highest prices paid in two years. As we&rsquo;ve seen elsewhere, this is bad news for the Fed lowering interest rates, but good for the economy at large.<br /><br /><h2>Quarterly Earnings Roundup: WMT, BABA &amp; More<br /></h2><br /><strong>Walmart </strong>WMT posted Q4 earnings ahead of today&rsquo;s open, outpacing estimates on the bottom line by a penny &mdash; 66 cents per share versus 65 expected &mdash; on a truly breathtaking $180.55 billion in sales over the three-month period. However, guidance was for trimming sales expectations, as the company does not believe it will be immune from new tariff policy on imported goods from China. Shares were down -6% on the news. For more on WMT&rsquo;s earnings. click here.<br /><br /><strong>Check out the updated Zacks Earnings Calendar here.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Alibaba</strong> BABA shares, on the other hand, are up +12% this morning following fiscal Q3 earnings hitting the tape: earnings of $2.93 per ADS was shy of the $3.08 in the Zacks consensus, but revenues of $38.6 billion were ahead of the $38.2 billion projected. The bigger news here may be the shift in policy from China&rsquo;s leaders, signaling an end to the crackdown on major companies in Chinese tech, like BABA.<br /><br /><strong>TripAdvisor</strong> TRIP saw another good quarter this morning, with Q4 earnings coming in at 30 cents per share as opposed to the expected 21 cents (though off the year-ago level of 38 cents per share a year ago). Revenues of $411 million outpaced estimates by +2.6%. TRIP shares have gained almost +20% year to date, but market participants are selling the news -2.5%. Will American travel keep up its lofty levels? That&rsquo;s the question. For more on TRIP&rsquo;s earnings, click here.</p><p><strong>Wayfair</strong> W, however, saw a big -1350% earnings miss for its Q4 bottom line this morning, posting -$0.02 per share versus projections for +$0.25. Revenues beat estimates by +1.73% to $3.12 billion in the quarter, and this turnaround in sales growth is generating interest in the stock, which is now up +8.5% in pre-market trading.

<![CDATA[ 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs Halfway Through Q1 ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>We are midway through the first quarter. Wall Street has been on a bull run, outplaying tariff trade war fears and concerns over a prolonged pause on Fed rate cuts. The S&amp;P 500 has been hitting new record highs while the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq Composite Index are just a few points away from record highs.<br /><br />We have highlighted five top-performing ETFs from different sectors that have been the leaders so far in the first quarter. These are <strong>AdvisorShares Psychedelics ETF</strong> PSIL,<strong> iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF</strong> RING, <strong>Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF </strong>NUKZ, <strong>iShares MSCI Global Silver and Metals Miners ETF</strong> SLVP, and <strong>Roundhill Video Games ETF</strong> NERD.<br /><br />A combination of strong economic indicators, advancements in AI and solid corporate earnings season are driving the rally. The U.S. economy has demonstrated robust growth, bolstered by strong consumer confidence, declining unemployment rates, rising wages and positive manufacturing surveys. Significant investments in AI and related technologies have spurred optimism about future productivity gains and economic expansion. Companies are allocating substantial capital toward AI, anticipating long-term benefits that justify current valuations.<br /><br />Meanwhile, this reporting cycle has been a good one, with the growth pace showing a notable accelerating trend and companies comfortably beating consensus estimates. Total earnings for 74% of the S&amp;P 500 are up 12.1% from the same period last year on 5.6% higher revenues, with 77.8% beating EPS estimates and 64.6% beating revenue estimates. This is notably a better performance relative to other recent periods, particularly in terms of the growth pace.<br /><br />Further, the rally has now broadened beyond the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; to other sectors like financials and industrials (read: AI Winners Following the DeepSeek Disruption).&nbsp;<br /><br />Lower interest rates add to the strength. Though the Fed has signaled no rush to reduce interest rates further as inflation remains elevated, since September 2024 it has made a series of rate cuts, by a total of 100 bps.</p><h2>Trade Worries Lingers</h2><p>President Donald Trump&#39;s tariff talks, which could lead to a global trade war, have been weighing on the stock market. Trump&rsquo;s 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, which was delayed by a month, is set to take effect next month. Last week, Trump announced global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which is expected to take effect on March 12. He also signed plans for reciprocal tariffs but delayed their implementation until April to allow his administration to negotiate on a one-by-one basis with countries that could be impacted.<br /><br />Another tariff threat came this week when Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs of 25% on automobile, semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports as soon as April.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s dig into the details of the abovementioned ETFs:<br /><br /><strong>AdvisorShares Psychedelics ETF (PSIL) &ndash; Up 32.9%</strong><br /><br />AdvisorShares Psychedelics ETF invests in the emerging psychedelic drugs sector, offering exposure to biotechnology, pharmaceutical and life sciences companies that it sees as leading the way in this nascent industry. It is an actively managed fund and holds 24 stocks in its basket with large concentration on the top two firms. AdvisorShares Psychedelics ETF has accumulated $11 million in its asset base and charges 99 bps in annual fees. It trades in an average daily volume of 14,000 shares.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF (RING) &ndash; Up 23.4%</strong><br /><br />iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF offers exposure to companies that derive the majority of their revenues from gold mining. It follows the MSCI ACWI Select Gold Miners Investable Market Index and holds 38 securities in its portfolio. Canadian firms take more than half of the portfolio, while the United States takes the next spot at 20% share. RING is the cheapest choice in the gold mining space, charging just 39 bps in fees and expenses. It has been able to manage assets worth $1.1 billion and trades in a good volume of 229,000 shares per day (read: Gold Rally to Continue: Leveraged ETFs to Make Profits).&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF (NUKZ) &ndash; Up 21.3%</strong><br /><br />Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF is designed to provide exposure to companies that are involved in the following segments: advanced reactor, utilities, construction &amp; services, and fuel. It tracks the Range Nuclear Renaissance Index and holds 38 stocks in its basket, with the largest concentration on the top firm. Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF has accumulated $246.3 million in its asset base while trading in an average daily volume of 160,000 shares. It charges 85 bps in annual fees.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>iShares MSCI Global Silver and Metals Miners ETF (SLVP) &ndash; Up 18.5%</strong><br /><br />iShares MSCI Global Silver and Metals Miners ETF follows the MSCI ACWI Select Silver Miners Investable Market Index, providing investors exposure to companies that derive the majority of revenues from silver exploration or metals mining. It holds 27 stocks in its basket, with Canadian firms making up the lion&rsquo;s share at 72.3%, while the United States and Mexico round off the next spots. iShares MSCI Global Silver and Metals Miners ETF has an AUM of $241.7 million and an average daily volume of about 133,000 shares. It charges 39 bps in annual fees (read: 5 Best-Performing Sector ETFs of Volatile January).&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Roundhill Video Games ETF (NERD) &ndash; Up 18.3%</strong><br /><br />Roundhill Video Games ETF offers exposure to 35 companies engaged in video game publishing and/or video game development. NERD follows the Nasdaq CTA Global Video Games Software Index, charging investors 50 bps as annual fees. Roundhill Video Games ETF accumulated $23.4 million in its asset base while trading in an average daily volume of 4,000 shares.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418824/5-best-performing-sector-etfs-halfway-through-q1?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2418824">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In 2020, Zacks Ranked #3 (Hold) stock <strong>Alibaba (</strong></span></span>BABA<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>)</strong> was at the top of its game. Dubbed the &ldquo;Amazon of China,&rdquo; BABA had a stranglehold on a massive and growing Chinese e-commerce business. BABA shares had rallied from the IPO price of ~$100 in 2014 to over $300 per share at its peak in 2020. Not only did BABA enjoy the benefit of a massive Chinese market, but the government kept foreign competitors from entering the market, and the Chinese economy looked poised to take over the U.S. economy.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">However, as is often the case on Wall Street, BABA&rsquo;s fortunes turned when things looked the best. The Covid-19 pandemic decimated the Chinese economy, leading to mass unemployment among youth. Worse yet, in November 2020, BABA founder and former CEO Jack MA delivered a speech critical of the Chinese government. Ma, who is the wealthiest man in China, was summoned for questioning by the government, and his ambition to bring BABA affiliate Ant Group (owner of the world&rsquo;s largest mobile payment platform, Alipay) was brought to a screeching halt when the company&rsquo;s stock market listing was suspended. Ma would disappear from public view for months as BABA shares plunged from ~$300 to $58 in December 2022.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>BABA Crushes Wall Street Expectations</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Until early 2025, BABA shares were be stuck in a frustrating trading range as the economy continued to sputter. However, over the past twelve months, the company appears to have finally turned the corner as shares gained more than 80%. Thursday morning, BABA smashed Wall Street expectations, confirming investors&rsquo; bullish bias. Revenue of 280.15B Yuan beat Wall Street expectations of 277.37B.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Why BABA Can Double from Here</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While BABA has appreciated nicely for bulls over the past few months, the move is likely just getting started. Below are five reasons to be long BABA:</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Multi-Year Breakout</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">An old Wall Street adage explains, &ldquo;The longer the base, the higher in space.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s good news for BABA bulls. BABA is breaking out of a 3-year base structure following its earnings beat.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/06/94616.jpg?v=1049845930" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: TradingView</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>BABA is Back on the Government&rsquo;s Good Side</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As BABA investors learned in 2020, growing a business is impossible without being on the controlling and powerful government&rsquo;s good graces. Earlier this month, Jack Ma was seen shaking hands with President Xi Jinping, signaling to investors that the relationship between BABA and the Chinese government had been rehabilitated.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>BABA is Cheap</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Despite the recent meteoric price rise, BABA&rsquo;s price-to-earnings ratio is near all-time lows as growth begins to pick up &ndash; a bullish combination.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f2/94617.jpg?v=667949848" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>New Revenue Sources </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In the earnings conference call, BABA CEO Eddie Wu explained,<strong><em>&ldquo;Our cloud revenue growth reignited to double digits at 13%, with AI-related product revenue achieving triple-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. Looking ahead, revenue growth at Cloud Intelligence Group driven by AI will continue to accelerate.&rdquo;</em></strong></span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>China Bull Market &amp; Smart Money Buyers</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Market history suggests that roughly 75% of a stock&rsquo;s move is correlated to the general market&rsquo;s direction. With the government stimulating the Chinese economy and the rapid success of the DeepSeek AI large language model, the Chinese stock market and the <strong>iShares China Large Cap ETF (FXI)</strong> are in bull mode. In addition, David Tepper, one of Wall Street&rsquo;s sharpest minds, has roughly a 20% allocation to Chinese stocks like <strong>Baidu (</strong></span></span>BIDU<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>),</strong> the <strong>Krane CSI China Internet ETF (</strong></span></span>KWEB<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>),</strong> and <strong>JD.com (</strong></span></span>JD<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>). </strong>Meanwhile, market breadth is robust, with lesser-known Chinese stocks like <strong>Futu Holdings (</strong></span></span>FUTU<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>)</strong> ripping higher.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In conclusion, a confluence of factors, including a multi-year breakout, renewed government favor, a low P/E ratio, burgeoning new revenue streams, and a broader Chinese market resurgence fueled by smart money &ndash; paints a compelling picture for Alibaba&rsquo;s future.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2418754/alibaba-back-on-track-and-poised-for-growth?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-investment_ideas-2418754">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AXIS Capital Holdings Limited</strong>&rsquo;s AXS shares are trading at a discount compared to the Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry. Its forward price-to-book value of 1.38X is lower than the industry average of 1.64X, the Finance sector&rsquo;s 4.24X and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite&rsquo;s 8.07X. The property and casualty insurer has a Value Score of B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/be/94567.jpg?v=1577902797" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The insurer has a market capitalization of $7.59 billion. The average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.6 million. The insurer has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 9.17%.<br /><br />Shares of <strong>The Travelers Companies, Inc.</strong> TRV are also trading at a multiple higher than the industry average, while <strong>NMI Holdings Inc</strong> NMIH and <strong>Cincinnati Financial Corporation</strong> CINF shares are trading at a discount.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AXS is an Outperformer</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of AXIS Capital have gained 48.5% in the past year, outperforming its industry, the Finance sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s growth of 16.5%, 25.5% and 24.1%, respectively.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">AXS Outperforms Industry, Sector &amp; S&amp;P</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9f/94568.jpg?v=1041981519" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AXS Trading Above 50-Day and 200-Day Moving Averages</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of AXIS Capital closed at $91.50 on Wednesday, near its 52-week high of $94.89. This proximity underscores investor confidence. It has the ingredients for further price appreciation. The stock is trading above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) of $90.04 and $79.87, respectively, indicating solid upward momentum. SMA is a widely used technical analysis tool to predict future price trends by analyzing historical price data.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AXS&rsquo; Growth Projection Encourages</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AXIS Capital&rsquo;s 2025 earnings per share indicates a year-over-year increase of 0.1%. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $6.76 billion, implying a year-over-year improvement of 10.8%.&nbsp;<br /><br />The consensus estimate for 2026 earnings per share and revenues indicates an increase of 10.1% and 6.4%, respectively, from the corresponding 2024 estimates.&nbsp;<br /><br />Earnings have grown 67.1% in the past five years, better than the industry average of 19.3%.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AXIS Capital&rsquo;s Favorable Return on Capital</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Return on equity in the trailing 12 months was 18.8%, better than the industry average of 7.6%. This highlights the company&rsquo;s efficiency in utilizing shareholders&rsquo; funds.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, the return on invested capital (ROIC) has been increasing over the last few quarters as the company raised its capital investment over the same time frame, reflecting AXS&rsquo; efficiency in utilizing funds to generate income. ROIC in the trailing 12 months was 11.6%, better than the industry average of 5.8%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Acting in Favor of AXS</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AXIS Capital aims to be a leading specialty underwriter and thus focuses on growth areas, including wholesale insurance and lower middle markets. Lowering risk exposure while concentrating on accident and health, excess and supply property, casualty, credit and surety, and specialty reinsurance lines bodes well for growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Insurance segment is poised to benefit from a diversified portfolio of global specialty businesses, leadership positions and growth opportunities across major business lines.<br /><br />The Reinsurance business should benefit from strong cycle management, focusing on improving the business mix.&nbsp;<br /><br />AXIS Capital stays focused on expanding digital capabilities to create new business growth in desirable smaller accounts. Simplifying operating structure, delivering efficiencies and capitalizing on productivity gains should help it achieve a general and administrative ratio of less than 11% by 2026.<br /><br />Strategic initiatives have been driving improvement in its operating earnings over the past few years.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Axis Capital&rsquo;s Impressive Dividend History</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Axis Capital&#39;s dividend track record is impressive. It hiked its dividend for 18 straight years and currently yields 1.9%, way above the industry average of 0.2%. The insurer boasts one of the highest dividend yields among its peers.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">This leading specialty insurer and global reinsurer, which aims to lead in specialty risks, has been repositioning its portfolio and strengthening its book of businesses. Focusing on prudently deploying resources while enhancing efficiencies, improving its portfolio mix and underwriting profitability poises Axis Capital for growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Its impressive dividend history, solid growth projections as well as attractive valuations are other positives. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ The Zacks Communication - Components industry appears well poised to benefit from healthy demand trends and an increasing user propensity to stay abreast of the latest digital innovations. However, volatility in prices due to elevated customer inventory levels, high capital expenditures for infrastructure upgrades, margin erosion, geopolitical conflicts and wars have dented the industry&rsquo;s profitability.<br /><br />Nevertheless, <strong>Arista Networks, Inc.</strong> ANET, <strong>Corning Incorporated</strong> GLW and <strong>AudioCodes Ltd.</strong> AUDC are likely to gain in the long run as demand for scalable infrastructure for seamless connectivity rises with the wide proliferation of IoT, fiber densification, transition to cloud and accelerated 5G rollout.<p><b>Industry Description</b></p><p>The Zacks Communication - Components industry primarily comprises companies that provide diverse telecom products and services to develop scalable network architecture, demand-driven video solutions and broadband access equipment. These include various building blocks such as small cells, routers and antennas incorporated into equipment and facilities, and subsequently utilized by service providers to build networks for end users. Their product portfolio encompasses optical and copper connectivity products, hybrid fiber-coaxial equipment, edge routers, metro Wi-Fi, storage and distribution equipment for cable TV operators, modems, EMTAs (Embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapter), gateways, set-top boxes, analog and digital microphones, audio processors, glass substrates for LCD TVs and notebooks, ceramic substrates for mobile and laboratory filtration products.</p><p><b>What's Shaping the Future of the Communication Components Industry?</b></p><p><em><strong>Network Convergence:</strong></em> With operators moving toward converged or multi-use network structures, combining voice, video and data communications into a single network, the industry is increasingly developing solutions with steady R&amp;D investments to support wireline and wireless network convergence. These investments are likely to help minimize service delivery costs to adequately support broadband competition and expand rural coverage and wireless densification. The industry players have enabled enterprises to rapidly scale communications functionalities to a vast range of applications and devices with easy-to-use software application programming interfaces. The firms support high user volumes without affecting deliverability and cost-effectively eliminate performance degradation.<br /><br /><em><strong>Cloud &amp; Fiber Gaining Priority:</strong></em> The firms are likely to benefit from a software-driven, data-centric approach that helps customers build their cloud architecture and enhance the cloud experience. The industry participants are well-poised for growth in data-driven cloud networking business with proactive platforms and predictive operations. Fiber networks are essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. Telecom service providers are increasingly leaning toward fiber optic cable to meet the burgeoning demand for cloud-based business data and video streaming services by individuals. Moreover, the fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and last-mile local loops, which are required by wireless service providers to deploy the 5G network.<br /><br /><em><strong>Healthy Demand Trends:</strong></em> As both consumers and enterprises are using networks more extensively, there is tremendous demand for quality networking components. Additionally, data consumption patterns are changing, with a growing propensity to consume more video content, creating the need for faster data transfer. Since optical networks are more efficient and most existing networks are copper-based, the demand for optical solutions is strong. The industry firms offer several products focused on the data center, with a typical portfolio consisting of optical fiber, hardware, cables and connectors, enabling them to meet the evolving customer requirements and bridge the digital divide across the United States.<br /><br /><strong><em>Margin Woes Persist:</em></strong> Although supply chain woes have declined progressively, the industry is facing a dearth of chips, which are the building blocks of various equipment used by telecom carriers. Moreover, high raw material prices due to the Middle East tensions, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and the consequent economic sanctions against the Putin regime have affected the operation schedule of various firms. High technological obsolescence of most products has escalated operating costs, while high customer inventory levels and a conservative approach toward placing orders for high-value items remain headwinds.</p><p><b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish Trends</b></p><p>The Zacks Communication - Components industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #45, which places it among the top 18% of more than 250 Zacks industries.<br /><br />The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid prospects.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Assurant, Inc.</strong> AIZ shares have risen 14.9% in the past year compared with the industry&#39;s growth of 11.1%. The Finance sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 index have returned 25.6% and 24.1%, respectively, in the said time frame. With a market capitalization of $10.26 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.3 million.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">AIZ price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b2/94555.jpg?v=1093770073" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AIZ Trading Above 50-Day and 200-Day Moving Averages</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently priced at $200.14, the stock is trading above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) of $192.78, indicating solid upward momentum. SMA is a widely used technical analysis tool to predict future price trends by analyzing historical price data.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Growth Projection for AIZ</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Assurant&rsquo;s 2025 earnings per share indicates a year-over-year increase of 1.4%. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $12.40 billion, implying a year-over-year improvement of 3.7%.&nbsp;<br /><br />The consensus estimate for 2026 earnings per share and revenues indicates an increase of 13.2% and 3.8%, respectively, from the corresponding 2024 estimates.&nbsp;<br /><br />Earnings have grown 16.6% in the past five years, better than the industry average of 9.7%. Assurant has an impressive Growth Score of B. This style score helps analyze the growth prospects of a company.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Estimate Revision</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 has moved 1.9% north in the past 30 days. This should instill investors&#39; confidence in the stock.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Impressive Earnings Surprise History of Assurant</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Assurant&rsquo;s bottom line surpassed earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 17.03%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Shares are Affordable</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Assurant is trading at a discount compared with the industry average. It presents a compelling investment opportunity with its attractive forward 12-month price-to-book ratio of 2.01X, lower than the industry average of 2.38X. Also, it has a Value Score of A.<br /><br />Shares of <strong>The Travelers Companies, Inc. </strong>TRV are also trading at a multiple higher than the industry average, while <strong>NMI Holdings Inc </strong>NMIH and <strong>Cincinnati Financial Corporation </strong>CINF shares are trading at a discount.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Assurant&rsquo;s Favorable Return on Capital</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Return on equity in the trailing 12 months was 17.2%, better than the industry average of 15.1%. This highlights the company&rsquo;s efficiency in utilizing shareholders&rsquo; funds.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, the return on invested capital (ROIC) has been increasing over the last few quarters as the company raised its capital investment over the same time frame, reflecting AIZ&rsquo;s efficiency in utilizing funds to generate income. ROIC in the trailing 12 months was 11.2%, better than the industry average of 2.3%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Impacting AIZ</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Assurant&rsquo;s focus on growing fee-based capital-light businesses, which account for 52% of segmental revenues, bodes well for growth. Management estimates that contribution from the same will continue to grow in double digits over the long term.<br /><br />Better Homeowners&rsquo; performance reflecting higher lender-placed net earned premiums should drive better results at Global Housing. At the same time, growth across Connected Living and Global Automotive should drive Global Lifestyle.<br /><br />The insurer remains focused on ramping up the Connected Living platform, deploying innovative products and services, and adding new partnerships. These initiatives are expected to double the margins of Connected Living to 8% over the long term.<br /><br />Investment income, which has been witnessing an increase in net investment income over the past few years, should benefit from higher yields on fixed-maturity securities.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Wealth Distribution&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AIZ has a solid capital management policy in place. Assurant&rsquo;s board of directors approved an 11% hike in cash dividend in November 2024. AIZ&rsquo;s distribution of wealth to shareholders via dividend hikes is impressive. The recent hike marks the insurer increasing dividends for straight 20 quarters. As of now $351 million remains under the current repurchase authorization. AIZ remains focused on maintaining balance and flexibility to support new business growth while returning excess capital to shareholders. From a share repurchase perspective, Assurant&rsquo;s expected range for 2025 is between $200 million and $300 million, subject to M&amp;A as well as market and other conditions.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Final Take on AIZ</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Well-performing Global Lifestyle business, growth of fee-based capital-light businesses, solid capital management, favorable estimates and effective capital deployment should favor Assurant&rsquo;s results. AIZ&#39;s higher return on capital and favorable growth estimates present significant growth opportunities.<br /><br />Assurant also has a VGM Score of B. Stocks with a favorable VGM Score are those with the most attractive value, best growth and most promising momentum compared with peers. Its impressive dividend history as well as attractive valuations are other positives. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

By abstracting complex quantum circuits into accessible functions and Qiskit patterns, IBM is making quantum computing more practical for business applications.&nbsp;<br /><br />This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is effectively removing traditional scaling limitations through modularity in both hardware and software, positioning itself well ahead of competitors. As quantum resources become woven with CPUs and GPUs into a unified compute fabric, IBM is poised to deliver unprecedented processing capabilities that will serve organizations tackling humanity&#39;s most complex challenges. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IBM&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has moved north by 1.5% to $10.77 per share in the past 30 days. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">QBTS: Pioneering Commercial Quantum Computing Today</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">D-Wave Quantum stands at the forefront of commercially viable quantum computing in 2025, distinguishing itself with real-world applications across multiple sectors. The company has impressively deployed the world&#39;s largest annealing quantum computers with more than 5,000 qubits and 15-way connectivity, achieving a remarkable 99.9% system availability. D-Wave&#39;s groundbreaking agricultural application with Staque demonstrates quantum&#39;s practical superiority, optimizing autonomous farm vehicle movements in real-time &mdash; a task impossible for classical computing alone.&nbsp;<br /><br />For investors watching the quantum space, this Zacks Rank #3 company presents a compelling opportunity as Forschungszentrum J&uuml;lich becomes the first HPC center globally to purchase their Advantage system, with plans to connect it to Europe&#39;s JUPITER exascale supercomputer. With a solid $320 million cash balance, industry-leading uptime, and demonstrated quantum advantage across multiple industries, D-Wave is delivering quantum computing benefits today while competitors remain in theoretical stages. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for QBTS&rsquo; 2025 earnings has remained steady at a loss of 38 cents per share in the past 30 days.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">IONQ: A Rising Star in the Quantum Computing Landscape</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors should keep a watchful eye on IonQ as it emerges as a formidable player in the quantum computing and networking space for 2025. The company&#39;s strategic acquisition of Qubitekk has significantly expanded its quantum networking capabilities and patent portfolio to more than 600 U.S. and international patents. IonQ&#39;s recent partnership with General Dynamics Information Technology opens lucrative opportunities in government and defense sectors, while substantial contracts with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab ($54.5 million and $21.1 million) demonstrate strong federal sector demand. This Zacks Rank #3 company is also expanding globally through its MOU with Busan Metropolitan City to advance quantum technology in South Korea.&nbsp;<br /><br />With doubled year-over-year revenues in third-quarter 2024 and growing adoption of its IonQ Forte Enterprise and Tempo systems, IonQ is well-positioned to capitalize on quantum computing&#39;s transformative potential across defense, finance and energy sectors, making it an attractive prospect for forward-thinking investors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IONQ&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has remained steady at a loss of $1.15 per share in the past 30 days.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418630/microsoft-s-majorana-1-shakes-up-the-quantum-realm-3-stocks-to-watch?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|industry_focus-2418630">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B&amp;G Foods, Inc.</strong> BGS is likely to witness a top-line decline when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 earnings on Feb. 25. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $546.65 million, indicating a 5.5% drop from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.&nbsp;<br /><br />The consensus mark for earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at 31 cents per share, which suggests a 3.3% increase from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. BGS has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 9.5%, on average.<br /><br /><em><strong>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">B&amp;G Foods, Inc.

Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BGS: Key Factors to Watch</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">B&amp;G Foods has been witnessing soft sales for the past few quarters due to macroeconomic headwinds, such as food inflation and shifts in consumer spending patterns. These industry-wide challenges have been weighing on demand in both retail and foodservice channels.&nbsp;<br /><br />B&amp;G Foods revised its 2024 outlook downward on its third-quarter earnings call, indicating a slower-than-expected recovery in center store trends and the broader consumer environment. The company anticipates stabilization only in fiscal 2025, which signals concerns for the fourth quarter.<br /><br />Input cost inflation is also a concern. However, B&amp;G Foods&rsquo; focus on innovation across several key categories has been working well. The company&rsquo;s Spices &amp; Flavor Solutions unit has been performing well, demonstrating its ability to capture consumer demand in an otherwise challenging environment. With Spices and Flavor Solutions being BGS&rsquo; highest-margin segment, continued momentum here bodes well.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Whispers for BGS Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model doesn&rsquo;t conclusively predict an earnings beat for B&amp;G Foods this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.&nbsp;<br /><br />B&amp;G Foods carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks With the Favorable Combination</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some companies worth considering, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.<br /><br /><strong>Costco Wholesale</strong> COST currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.14% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is likely to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2025 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Costco&rsquo;s quarterly revenues is pegged at $63.2 billion, which suggests 8.2% growth from the prior-year quarter. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong><br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Costco&rsquo;s quarterly earnings per share is pegged at $4.09, indicating a 10.2% increase from the year-ago period. COST has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2%, on average.<br /><br /><strong>Urban Outfitters</strong> URBN currently has an Earnings ESP of +11.94% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.63 billion, which indicates growth of 9.4% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Urban Outfitters&rsquo; fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 EPS is pegged at 89 cents, which implies an almost 29% increase year over year. URBN has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 22.8%, on average.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Sprouts Farmers Market </strong>SFM currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.63% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is likely to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprouts Farmers&rsquo; quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.95 billion, which suggests an increase of 15% from the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprouts Farmers&rsquo; quarterly earnings per share is pegged at 73 cents, indicating nearly 49% growth from the year-ago period. SFM has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 15.3%, on average.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418558/b-g-foods-q4-earnings-on-deck-what-to-expect-from-bgs-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2418558">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Intel on Best Streak in Decades: Should You Buy Its ETFs? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Intel INTC has been showing a remarkable surge in its stock price, marking its longest winning streak since the 1980s. The strong momentum is driven by a combination of political developments, strategic business moves and market speculation. Intel stock has added more than $200 billion in value over the past two weeks.&nbsp;<br /><br />Investors seeking to tap the growth prospects could invest in ETFs having the highest allocation to the semiconductor player. These include <strong>First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF</strong> FTXL, <strong>REX FANG &amp; Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF </strong>FEPI, <strong>Xtrackers Semiconductor Select Equity ETF </strong>CHPS, <strong>ProShares Nanotechnology ETF</strong> TINY and <strong>VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF </strong>SMH.<br /><br />Investors should note that these funds have spread out exposure to a number of firms in various types of industries, suggesting that these can easily counter shocks from some of the industry&rsquo;s biggest components.<br /><br />Here are the reasons for the hot streak in Intel stock price:<br /><br /><strong>Political Support for Domestic Chip Manufacturing</strong>: U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance emphasized the administration&#39;s commitment to bolstering domestic semiconductor production. At an AI summit in Paris, Vance highlighted plans to ensure that AI chips are both designed and manufactured within the United States, aiming to safeguard American technological leadership. This political backing has instilled confidence among investors regarding Intel&#39;s future prospects.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Potential Partnerships and Acquisitions</strong>: According to reports, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM is rumored to be considering a stake in Intel&#39;s chip manufacturing facilities, while Broadcom AVGO has shown interest in Intel&#39;s chip design and marketing divisions. These speculations have fueled optimism about Intel&#39;s strategic restructuring and potential value realization (see: all the Technology ETFs here).&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Divestment of Non-Core Assets</strong>: Intel is reportedly in discussions about selling a majority stake in its Altera programmable chip unit to private equity firm Silver Lake Management. This move aligns with Intel&#39;s strategy to streamline operations and focus on core competencies, potentially enhancing financial flexibility for future investments.&nbsp;<br /><br />Intel, once dominant in the chip industry, has struggled to regain its technological edge and lost market share to rivals in recent years. The combination of factors could bring back its allure. However, the potential TSMC and Broadcom deals may encounter regulatory scrutiny, especially concerning national security and antitrust considerations.</p><h2>ETFs in Focus</h2><p><strong>First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (FTXL)</strong><br /><br />First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF offers exposure to the most liquid U.S. semiconductor securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Semiconductor Index. FTXL holds 31 stocks in its basket, with Intel taking the second spot at 10% share (read: ETFs in Focus Post Intel&#39;s Q4 Earnings Beat).&nbsp;<br /><br />First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF has $304.3 million in AUM. The average trading volume is good at around 270,000 shares and the expense ratio is 0.60%. FTXL has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy).<br /><br /><strong>REX FANG &amp; Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF (FEPI)</strong><br /><br />REX FANG &amp; Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF is an actively managed ETF providing exposure to leading tech firms within the equally weighted FANG &amp; Innovation Index. It aims for enhanced income by selling out-of-the-money call options, harnessing big tech&rsquo;s volatility while capping some of the potential stock gains. FEPI also uses the covered call approach to counterbalance potential market declines, seeking to offer mitigation from price declines on these big tech stocks.<br /><br />REX FANG &amp; Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF holds 41 stocks in its basket, with Intel occupying the top spot with a 6.8% share. It trades in an average daily volume of 173,000 shares.<br /><br /><strong>Xtrackers Semiconductor Select Equity ETF (CHPS)</strong><br /><br />Xtrackers Semiconductor Select Equity ETF seeks to track the Solactive Semiconductor ESG Screened Index. It holds 52 stocks, with INTC being the top firm with a 5.4% share. Xtrackers Semiconductor Select Equity ETF charges 15 bps in annual fees and has AUM of $7.5 million. It trades in an average daily volume of 1,000 shares.<br /><br /><strong>ProShares Nanotechnology ETF (TINY)</strong><br /><br />ProShares Nanotechnology ETF invests in companies that help businesses use nanoscale technology to transform lives and revolutionize industries. It follows the Solactive Nanotechnology Index and holds 30 securities in its basket with Intel occupying the third position at 5.2% share.<br /><br />ProShares Nanotechnology ETF has accumulated $5.7 million in its asset base and trades in an average daily volume of 1,000 shares. It charges 58 bps in fees annually from investors.<br /><br /><strong>VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)</strong><br /><br />VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF offers exposure to companies involved in semiconductor production and equipment. It follows the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index, which tracks the most liquid companies in the industry based on market capitalization and trading volume. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF holds 26 stocks in its basket, with Intel occupying the sixth position at 4.5% (read: Should You Apply &quot;Buy the Dip&quot; Strategy in Tech ETFs?). &nbsp;<br /><br />VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF has managed assets worth $23.5 billion and charges 35 bps in annual fees and expenses. SMH trades in an average daily volume of 6 million shares and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 with a High risk outlook.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418557/intel-on-best-streak-in-decades-should-you-buy-its-etfs?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2418557">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The natural foods industry has evolved from a niche market into a mainstream sector, thanks to growing health consciousness and environmental awareness among consumers. With an increasing focus on clean eating, sustainability and ethical sourcing, natural and organic food products have rapidly gained popularity. As consumers seek products that align with their health goals, ethical farming practices and environmentally friendly production methods have become integral to the natural food movement.<br /><br />Consumers are gravitating toward products that offer transparency in sourcing and minimal processing. Shoppers are scrutinizing ingredient labels, favoring organic, non-GMO (genetically modified organisms) and preservative-free options. Governments worldwide are also promoting clean eating and stricter food labeling regulations, further driving market expansion. As a result, natural food companies are seeing stronger brand loyalty and the ability to command premium pricing.<br /><br />Companies like <strong>The Hain Celestial Group, Inc.</strong> HAIN and <strong>Vital Farms, Inc.</strong> VITL are responding to the rising demand for organic, clean-label and ethically sourced foods. With consumers prioritizing transparency, sustainability and minimal processing, the market for natural foods continues to grow. Expanding farm networks, plant-based innovations and a focus on humane, eco-friendly production are shaping the industry&#39;s future.<br /><br />The natural foods industry is set to evolve with continuous innovation and expanding product categories. Companies are investing in plant-based alternatives, functional foods enriched with vitamins and probiotics, and sustainable farming technologies. E-commerce is also playing a crucial role in making natural foods more accessible, allowing consumers to shop for organic and gluten-free products with ease. The global healthy foods market is expected to reach $2.26 trillion by 2035.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you&#39;re looking to capitalize on this trend, our Natural Foods Screen makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks such as <strong>United Natural Foods, Inc.</strong> UNFI, <strong>Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.</strong> SFM and <strong>Beyond Meat, Inc.</strong> BYND.<br /><br /><em><strong>Explore 30 cutting-edge investment themes with Zacks Thematic Screens and uncover your next big opportunity.</strong></em></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">3 Natural Foods Stocks to Watch</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>United Natural</strong> stands as a prominent player in the natural foods sector, serving as one of the largest distributors of organic and natural products in North America. Through its extensive network, UNFI supplies a vast array of products, including fresh produce, pantry staples, dairy alternatives and plant-based foods. With its diverse portfolio, the company caters to both retail giants and independent natural food stores, meeting the growing demand for cleaner, healthier eating options.<br /><br />As the natural foods industry continues to expand, UNFI is well-positioned to capitalize on the shift toward organic, non-GMO and ethically sourced products. Its wide-reaching distribution capabilities and strategic partnerships allow the company to provide an extensive selection of natural and organic foods that appeal to health-conscious consumers. The company&rsquo;s natural business continues to outperform industry trends, driven by strong volume growth and enhanced supplier collaborations.&nbsp;<br /><br />This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is increasingly focusing on innovation and sustainability within the natural foods space. The company has committed to enhancing its supply-chain practices, reducing waste and supporting regenerative agriculture initiatives. UNFI is also working closely with suppliers to accelerate food innovation. Through its supplier go-to-market program, the company has simplified the process of bringing new natural and organic products to store shelves. This initiative has enabled suppliers to reintroduce thousands of SKUs that were previously discontinued, expanding consumer access to diverse and healthier food options. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Sprouts Farmers</strong> has been at the forefront of the natural and organic food movement, catering to health-conscious consumers seeking fresh, high-quality and ethically sourced products. The company&rsquo;s commitment to fresh, organic and attribute-driven products sets it apart. With nearly 46% of total produce sales now coming from organic products, SFM continues to expand its assortment, ensuring accessibility to high-quality, responsibly sourced food.<br /><br />A key element of SFM&rsquo;s strategy is its innovative product development and sourcing initiatives. Notable offerings include organic grass-fed meatballs, pasture-raised poultry and globally inspired Sprouts-branded items, such as Moroccan and al pastor-flavored chickpeas. These exclusive, trend-forward products cater to the evolving preferences of health-conscious consumers.<br /><br />This Zacks Rank #2 company continues to strengthen its connection with customers through tailored marketing and engagement efforts, such as social media campaigns and in-store discovery events like Sprouts Brand Discovery Days. These initiatives showcase the company&rsquo;s differentiated offerings while attracting a younger demographic and increasing foot traffic.<br /><br /><strong>Beyond Meat</strong> is transforming plant-based food by using cleaner, healthier ingredients. The company&rsquo;s latest Beyond 4 products, including the Beyond Burger and Beyond Beef, are made from a blend of yellow peas, brown rice, red lentils and fava beans. These ingredients provide 21 grams of protein per serving while cutting saturated fat by 75% compared to traditional beef burgers, thanks to the use of avocado oil. This commitment to nutrition has earned recognition from the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association, reinforcing Beyond Meat&rsquo;s focus on making plant-based options both tasty and healthy.<br /><br />Beyond Meat is also expanding its product range to meet evolving consumer tastes. The introduction of Beyond Sun Sausage marks a significant departure from conventional meat alternatives, embracing a new category of plant-based protein not modeled after beef, pork or poultry. This product, packed with 12 grams of protein and just 1 gram of saturated fat from avocado oil, has received strong endorsements for its clean-label approach. Furthermore, the company has unveiled Beyond Steak Filet, a whole-muscle alternative crafted from mycelium, the root-like structure of mushrooms, along with legume proteins.&nbsp;<br /><br />This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company&#39;s commitment to food innovation extends beyond retail into food service partnerships. The reintroduction of Beyond The Original Orange Chicken at Panda Express and the expansion of Beyond Nuggets at McDonald&#39;s locations in Europe underscore its ability to integrate healthier, plant-based options into mainstream dining. At the same time, Beyond Meat is working to educate consumers on its clean-label approach, challenging misconceptions about plant-based food processing.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418548/3-natural-foods-stocks-positioned-for-success-in-2025?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|investment_ideas-2418548">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

During the reported quarter, the company experienced a sequential increase in gross business wins, indicating a positive but volatile demand environment in both the large pharma and biotech divisions. Per management, even though two of its largest customers are undergoing development model transitions, its fourth-quarter performance was in line with company&rsquo;s expectations.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the contraction of gross margins is discouraging.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ICLR&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ICON currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are <strong>Quest Diagnostics</strong> DGX,<strong> ResMed</strong> RMD and <strong>Cardinal Health</strong> CAH.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quest Diagnostics reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $2.23, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SM Energy Company</strong>&nbsp;SM reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $1.91 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86. The bottom line increased from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s figure of $1.56.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total quarterly revenues of $852 million increased from $609 million in the year-ago quarter but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $855 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The strong quarterly earnings can be attributed to increased oil equivalent production volumes, partially offset by higher hydrocarbon production expenses.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>SM Energy Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="SM Energy Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/64/1740047165.png" title="" width="568" /> <p>SM Energy Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | SM Energy Company Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Operational Performance</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Production</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">SM Energy&rsquo;s fourth-quarter production totaled 208 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBoe/d) (almost 51% oil), up nearly 36% from the year-ago level of 153.5 MBoe/d. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same was pinned at 212 MBoe/d.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Oil production increased 62% year over year to 106.9 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d). The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 110 MBbls/d.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company produced 424.8 million cubic feet per day of natural gas in the quarter, up 17% year over year. Natural gas liquids contributed 30.3 MBbls/d to the total production volume. The figure improved 13% on a year-over-year basis.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Realized Prices</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Before the effects of derivative settlements, the average realized price per Boe was $43.68 compared with $42.99 in the year-ago quarter. The average realized oil price slipped 10% to $69.34 per barrel.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The average realized price of natural gas declined 11% year over year to $2.19 per thousand cubic feet, while that for natural gas liquids increased 12% to $24.49 per barrel.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Costs &amp; Expenses</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">On the cost front, unit lease operating expenses increased 1% year over year to $5.35 per Boe. General and administrative expenses decreased 16% to $2.19 per Boe from the prior-year level of $2.60. Transportation expenses jumped 97% to $4.10 per Boe.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total hydrocarbon production expenses in the quarter were $214.6 million compared with the year-ago level of $137.3 million. Total exploration expenses were $16.3 million, higher than the year-ago figure of $15.8 million.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Capex</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Capital expenditures in the December-end quarter totaled $362.3 million, and adjusted free cash flow amounted to $188.9 million.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Balance Sheet</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, SM Energy had no cash and cash equivalents and a net debt of $2.8 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For the first quarter of 2025, SM Energy expects production to be in the range of 191-198 MBoe/d. Of the total production, oil will likely contribute 52-53%. Capital expenditures (net of the change in capital accruals), excluding acquisitions, are estimated to be in the $425-$435 million range.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For full-year 2025, the company anticipates net production volume to be in the range of 200-215 MBoe/d. Oil is anticipated to account for 51-52% of the total production. At the midpoint, this implies a year-over year increase in production of 22% on a Boe basis and an increase in oil production of 33%. Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank and Other Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, SM Energy carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the&nbsp;energy&nbsp;sector may look at some other top-ranked stocks like <strong>Antero Resources Corporation</strong> AR, <strong>NextDecade Corporation </strong>NEXT and <strong>Viper Energy, Inc.</strong>&nbsp;VNOM. While Antero Resources and NextDecade presently sport a Zacks Rank #1 each, Viper Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).&nbsp;You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Antero Resources, one of the fastest-growing natural gas producers in the United States, boasts a strategic acreage position in the low-risk properties of the Appalachian Basin. The company has more than two decades of premium low-cost drilling inventory in the prolific basin, securing a strong production outlook. AR is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing demand for LNG, both in the United States and globally.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NextDecade is an emerging player in the LNG space with its Rio Grande LNG project in Texas. As demand for LNG continues to grow, NextDecade&rsquo;s strategic investments in infrastructure and its planned liquefaction capacity provide strong upside potential. With the global LNG market expanding, the company is well-positioned to tap into the increasing export demand from the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Viper Energy is a variable distribution MLP based in Midland, TX. It generates strong and steady royalty income from its royalty acres in the prolific Eagle Ford and Permian Basin, with active rigs providing ample growth potential. The business strategies of the partnership include acquiring mineral interests from third parties and the parent company.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418545/sm-energy-q4-earnings-beat-estimates-revenues-miss?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418545">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ ExxonMobil Eyes Major Gas Expansion in Guyana's Stabroek Block ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 14:24:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Exxon Mobil Corporation </strong>XOM is set to enhance natural gas production and supply in Guyana with a large-scale project following the government&#39;s call for increased gas resources to support onshore power and petrochemical initiatives, per a Reuters report. Alistair Routledge, head of ExxonMobil&#39;s operations in Guyana, unveiled the &quot;Wales Gas Vision&quot; at an energy conference in Georgetown, emphasizing its potential to supply gas for various power generation and petrochemical projects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The initiative followed the completion of a $1 billion pipeline last year that will transport gas produced from ExxonMobil&#39;s extensive Stabroek Block. The Guyanese government will utilize a portion of this gas for power generation and natural gas liquids production. Furthermore, plans include the establishment of an offshore gas processing and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility, set to be developed by U.S.-based Fulcrum LNG.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Energy minister Vickram Bharrat mentioned that ExxonMobil is likely to oversee the construction of additional pipelines to transport the government&rsquo;s entitled gas, known as profit gas, to Fulcrum LNG&#39;s facility. This facility aims to facilitate LNG exports and supply gas to the Berbice area of Guyana, which is expected to enhance fertilizer and alumina production.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While the total investment figures for these projects remain undisclosed, the government believes that ample gas is available for commercial endeavors, pending a complete assessment of gas resources at ExxonMobil&#39;s block. According to the minister, &quot;There will be a shift towards gas utilization and monetization,&quot; as the government prepares to launch its ambitious gas strategy later this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The XOM-led consortium, which includes U.S. firm Hess and China&#39;s CNOOC, is gearing up to significantly increase gas output in the upcoming years. It is focusing on projects that involve non-associated gas, such as the Longtail project. A final investment decision for Longtail, projected to deliver up to 1.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas, is anticipated next year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ExxonMobil has expressed its readiness to supply gas to shore, according to Alistair Routledge at Guyana&#39;s Energy Conference. Bharrat stated earlier on Wednesday that Guyana is working to incorporate natural gas into its oil-dominated energy mix, aiming to enhance power generation and create new revenue streams through petrochemical and LNG exports.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, ExxonMobil confirmed that the country&#39;s fourth floating oil production facility, constructed by SBM Offshore and recently departing from Singapore, is scheduled to begin operations in the third quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As Guyana shifts toward a more diversified energy portfolio, the collaboration between ExxonMobil and the government signals a significant step in enhancing the country&#39;s natural gas capabilities, positioning it for a future beyond its oil-dominated landscape.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">XOM&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, XOM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the&nbsp;energy&nbsp;sector may look at some better-ranked stocks like <strong>SM</strong> <strong>Energy</strong> <strong>Company</strong> SM, <strong>NextDecade Corporation </strong>NEXT and <strong>Range Resources Corporation&nbsp;</strong>RRC. While SM Energy and NextDecade presently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, Range Resources carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).&nbsp;You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SM Energy is set to expand its oil-centered operations in the coming years, with an increasing focus on crude oil, especially in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford regions. The company&rsquo;s attractive oil and gas investments should create long-term value for shareholders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NextDecade is an emerging player in the LNG space with its Rio Grande LNG project in Texas. As demand for LNG continues to grow, NextDecade&rsquo;s strategic investments in infrastructure and its planned liquefaction capacity provide strong upside potential. With the global LNG market expanding, the company is well-positioned to tap into the increasing export demand from the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Range Resources is among the top 10 natural gas producers in the United States. Its&nbsp;diversified portfolio is spread between low-risk and long reserve-life Appalachian assets. The company&rsquo;s extensive inventory of Marcellus resources with low breakeven points is a significant asset. With expanded LPG export capacity, RRC is well-positioned to meet the rising global demand, capitalizing on natural gas&#39; role as a cleaner-burning fuel amid a low-carbon shift.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418540/exxonmobil-eyes-major-gas-expansion-in-guyana-s-stabroek-block?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_energy_sector-2418540">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BioMarin Pharmaceutical </strong>BMRN reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 92 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents. Quarterly earnings rose 88% year over year, driven by higher product sales and lower operating expenses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues were $747.3 million, which rose 16% year over year on a reported basis and 21% on a constant-currency basis. Strong sales of Voxzogo drove this upside. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $711.9 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks </em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar </em></strong><strong><em>to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">More on BMRN&rsquo;s Q4 Earnings</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Product revenues totaled $735.6 million, which rose 16% year over year on higher revenues from Voxzogo, Vimizim, Naglazyme and Palynziq. This was partially offset by lower Kuvan sales.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Royalty and other revenues totaled $11.7 million, down 11% year over year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Voxzogo Sales Drive BioMarin&rsquo;s Top Line</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Voxzogo, approved for achondroplasia, generated sales of $208 million, up 42% year over year, driven by strong demand across all marketed territories. During the quarter, BioMarin generated about 26% of the figure from sales in the United States and the rest from ex-U.S. markets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The drug&rsquo;s sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $196 million and $202 million, respectively.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BMRN&rsquo;s Enzyme Therapies Boost Sales Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In September, the company updated its organizational structure and decided to consolidate revenues from its five products &mdash; Aldurazyme, Brineura, Naglazyme, Palynziq and Vimizim &mdash; under a single head &#39;Enzyme Therapies.&#39;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Palynziq injection sales grossed $100 million in the quarter, up 14% year over year, driven by increased patient uptake in the United States. The drug&rsquo;s sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $94 million and our model estimate of $91 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Vimizim sales increased 9% year over year to $191 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $182 million each. Naglazyme sales rose 12% year over year to $110 million. Brineura added sales of $48 million, which rose 9% year over year. Sales of these drugs were driven by new patient starts and continued efforts to ensure treatment continuity for existing patients.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Product revenues from Aldurazyme totaled $39 million, down 9% year over year, likely due to the unfavorable timing of order fulfillment to <strong>Sanofi</strong> SNY.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BioMarin signed a collaboration agreement with&nbsp;Sanofi&rsquo;s subsidiary, Genzyme, for Aldurazyme. Sanofi, through Genzyme, is BMRN&rsquo;s sole customer for Aldurazyme. The Sanofi subsidiary is responsible for marketing and selling Aldurazyme to third parties.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Revenues</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">New gene therapy, Roctavian, generated $11 million in sales compared with $3 million in the year-ago period. Sales likely rose as part of the company&rsquo;s updated strategy to focus on three prioritized countries &mdash; the United States, Germany and Italy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the phenylketonuria franchise, Kuvan revenues declined 24% to $28 million due to generic competition. The drug lost U.S. market exclusivity in late 2020.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Full-Year 2024 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">BioMarin reported total revenues of $2.85 billion, up 18% year over year on a reported basis and 22% on a constant-currency basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s reported earnings for 2024 were $3.52 per share, up 69% from the year-ago period&rsquo;s level.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BMRN&rsquo;s 2025 Outlook Encouraging</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2025, BioMarin expects to record total revenues in the range of $3.1-$3.2 billion, implying an increase of around 10% year over year at the midpoint. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at around $3.07 billion. Management reiterated its target to achieve $4 billion in total revenues by 2027.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Management expects Voxzogo to be a significant contributor to the top line. It anticipates the drug&rsquo;s sales to be in the range of $900-$950 million. Based on the encouraging uptake for Voxzogo, BioMarin expects the drug&rsquo;s sales to witness a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 25% during 2023-2027.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted operating margin is expected to be between 32% and 33%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BioMarin expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.20-$4.40, suggesting 22% growth over last year&rsquo;s level at the midpoint. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pinned at $4.01.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of BioMarin rose more than 9% in after-market trading on Wednesday, likely due to the encouraging guidance. Year to date, the stock has underperformed the industry.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/04/94564.jpg?v=1070755532" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BMRN&rsquo;s Recent Pipeline Updates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">BioMarin is actively enrolling patients in a pivotal registrational program on Voxzogo in patients with hypochondroplasia, a condition characterized by impaired bone growth. Management has also advanced the drug in clinical studies for four other short-stature pathway conditions &mdash; idiopathic short stature, Noonan Syndrome, Turner Syndrome and SHOX deficiency. Enrollment in all these programs is currently ongoing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company expects to report data from a late-stage study evaluating Palynziq for PKU in adolescents in the second half of 2025. If data from this study is positive, management will target regulatory filings for the drug in the United States by late 2025 and in ex-U.S. territories by early 2026.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before this year&rsquo;s end, management also expects to report initial proof-of-concept data from an early-stage study on BMN 351, a next-generation oligonucleotide for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BMRN&rsquo;s Zacks Rank</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">BioMarin currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. Price</h2> <img alt="BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.

<![CDATA[ Should Edwards Lifesciences Stock Remain in Your Portfolio Now? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 14:23:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Edwards Lifesciences</strong>&rsquo; EW fourth-quarter performance was backed by its most comprehensive structural heart disease portfolio. The Surgical Structural Heart business is benefiting from the strong adoption of premium surgical technologies worldwide. In the TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) segment, the increasing global uptake of SAPIEN portfolio is highly encouraging. Meanwhile, a volatile macro economy and adverse currency impacts may dent Edwards&rsquo; growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company&rsquo;s shares have lost 13.8% against 4.8% growth of the industry and a 24.1% increase of the S&amp;P 500 composite.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $44.63 billion. EW&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 2.60%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s delve deeper.</p><h2>Upsides for EW</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Surgical Structural Heart, a Promising Business</strong>: The business pioneered the innovative RESILIA tissue technology. The favorable data from the COMMENCE aortic and mitral trials, studying the safety and effectiveness of bioprosthetic valves made with RESILIA tissue, continues to support the strong momentum of the portfolio globally.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the fourth quarter of 2024, the segment grew 5% from the prior-year level, driven by strong global adoption of Edwards&rsquo; premium surgical technologies, INSPIRIS, MITRIS and KONECT. The company continues to see positive procedure growth globally for the many patients treated surgically, including those undergoing complex procedures.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Edwards has been continuously generating evidence to expand the RESILIA portfolio. In line with this, during the fourth quarter, the company shared multi-center real-world KONECT study data for the past year at the STS conference.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As another major development, Edwards Lifesciences closed the acquisition of Endotronix in 2024, marking its entry into implantable heart failure management (IHFM).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TAVR Holds Potential</strong>: The company&rsquo;s TAVR platform is positioned for continued global leadership and strong, sustainable growth. The business closed the fourth quarter of 2024 with 5.3% year-over-year growth. The company remains committed to advancing evidence for AS patients. In the United States, the year-over-year TAVR sales growth rate was in line with the global TAVR constant currency growth rate.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Outside the United States, TAVR sales growth was supported by the continued launch of SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA in Europe. Management anticipates TAVR growth momentum to continue as centers gradually adopt these new therapies and become part of extended processes. In Japan, EW continues to focus on expanding the ability of this therapy, with AS being a significant undertreated disease among the substantial elderly population.&nbsp;</p><h2>Concerns for Edwards</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Macro Concerns Weigh on the Bottom Line</strong>: The global economy continues to experience volatility and disruptions, including inflation and factors influencing overall economic stability and the political environment relating to health care.&nbsp; Additionally, any significant increase in the cost of raw materials and supply constraints stemming from geopolitical complications, regulatory changes or otherwise could weigh heavily on the company&rsquo;s operating results.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/0c/94544.jpg?v=1818918786" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Post-pandemic, the business has been experiencing staffing shortages within the hospital systems and a surge in medical supply expenses, laying significant pressure on the margins of medical device companies like Edwards.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Foreign Exchange Headwinds</strong>: Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Edwards because a considerable percentage of its revenues comes from outside the United States. The unfavorable currency fluctuations have adversely impacted EW&rsquo;s gross margin over the past few quarters. Foreign exchange rates decreased fourth-quarter gross profit margin by 30 basis points compared to the prior year.&nbsp;</p><h2>EW&rsquo;s Estimate Trend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $2.45 in the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $5.81 billion, implying a 2.6% decline from the year-ago reported number.</p><h2>Top MedTech Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are <strong>Phibro Animal Health </strong>PAHC, <strong>Veracyte</strong> VCYT and <strong>Quest Diagnostics</strong> DGX.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Phibro Animal Health has an estimated fiscal 2025 earnings growth rate of 43.7% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 14.4%. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 27.06%. Its shares have surged 115% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 15.5% growth in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PAHC sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Veracyte, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated 2024 earnings growth rate of 138.2% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 15.4%. Shares of the company have surged 54.4% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 7.3% growth over the past year. VCYT&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 520.58%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quest Diagnostics, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an earnings yield of 5.87% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 4.02%. Shares of the company have rallied 28.4% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 14.8% growth. DGX&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.75%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418537/should-edwards-lifesciences-stock-remain-in-your-portfolio-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2418537">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Pinnacle West Capital Corporation</strong> PNW is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 25, before market open. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 0.6% in the last reported quarter.<br /><br /><em><strong>See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</strong></em><br /><br />Let&rsquo;s discuss the factors that are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.</p><h2>Major Factors That Might Have Impacted PNW&#39;s Q4 Performance</h2><p>Pinnacle West Capital&rsquo;s top-line performance is expected to have benefited from retail customer growth and an increase in retail electricity sales. The quarterly results are likely to gain from robust commercial load growth driven by data centers.<br /><br />Arizona Public Service&rsquo;s (&ldquo;APS&rdquo;) Energy Management System is expected to continue to provide a better foundation, which might improve the future integration of renewable and energy storage assets into APS&rsquo; generation resource portfolio. This is likely to have had a positive impact on the company&rsquo;s quarterly performance.<br /><br />However, planned outage in the fourth quarter might have resulted in higher operations and maintenance expenses. Higher depreciation, amortization and property taxes must have offset some positives.</p><h2>PNW&rsquo;s Q4 Expectations</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at a loss of 15 cents per share.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pinned at $1.06 billion, implying a year-over-year increase of 6.6%.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total electric sales is pinned at 7,617.83 gigawatt-hour, up 0.9% from the figure registered in the year-ago quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>What Our Quantitative Model Predicts</h2><p>Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Pinnacle West Capital this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here as you will see below. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise" height="303" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/16/1740054169.png" title="" width="617" /> </p><p>Pinnacle West Capital Corporation price-eps-surprise | Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Quote</p></div><p><strong>Earnings ESP:</strong> The company&rsquo;s Earnings ESP is 0.00%.

<![CDATA[ Itron Gears Up to Report Q4 Earnings: Here's What to Expect ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 14:21:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Itron, Inc.</strong> ITRI is slated to report fourth-quarter 2024 earnings on Feb. 25, before market open.<br /><br /><em><strong>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks</strong></em> <strong><em>Earnings Calendar.</em></strong><br /><br />The company expects fourth-quarter revenues to be between $600 million and $610 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $603.2 million, indicating an increase of 4.5% from a year ago.<br /><br />Non-GAAP earnings per share are anticipated to be $1.00-$1.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.05 per share. The company reported earnings of $1.23 per share in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />ITRI&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 49.7%. The stock has gained 31.5% in the past year compared with the Zacks Electronics-Testing Equipment industry&rsquo;s growth of 3.8%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a9/94595.jpg?v=233743499" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Key Factors at Play</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Healthy demand momentum, robust operational execution and the timing of customer shipments are likely to have aided Itron&rsquo;s performance in the fourth quarter.<br /><br />Continued strength in the Grid Edge Intelligence platform is a tailwind. Multiple factors, such as data center-related demand growth, reindustrialization and production localization, as well as electrification of transportation and homes, are driving the platform&rsquo;s growth prospects. The automation of water infrastructure, safety applications for gas customers and the digitalization of its operations are major driving forces.<br /><br />Higher demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and distributed energy resources (DERs) is likely to have buoyed customer bookings. Management plans to capitalize on the growing uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions across the utility industry, promoting infrastructure modernization and cutting-edge data analysis.<br /><br />The Device Solutions segment is likely to have been driven by strong sales of smart water and electric solutions. The Networked Solutions unit is gaining traction with new projects and ongoing large-scale deployments. The Outcomes segment has been gaining from higher recurring revenues, services and software offerings. We expect fourth-quarter revenues from the Device Solutions, Outcomes and Networked Solutions segments to be $116.5 million, $407.6 million and $78.6 million, respectively.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Itron, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Itron, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/4e/1740057254.png" title="" width="533" /> <p>Itron, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Itron, Inc. Quote</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, rising operating costs and a debt-laden balance sheet amid an uncertain macroeconomic landscape pose concerns.</p><h2>Recent Developments</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">On Jan. 22, 2025, Itron partnered with Encycle Technologies, Inc. to foster energy management efficiency for both commercial and industrial customers by combining Encycle&rsquo;s expertise in autonomous intelligence and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) optimization with Itron&rsquo;s innovative solutions for energy and water management. It focuses on reducing HVAC energy loads during peak demand challenges, mitigating grid stress and improving grid reliability.<br /><br />On Dec. 19, 2024, Itron partnered with Xcel Energy to address Colorado&#39;s evolving energy needs. This collaboration focuses on integrating DERs, including residential battery energy storage, into the grid to enhance grid flexibility and reliability and meet customer demand. XEL will deploy Itron&rsquo;s DERMS. This technology is part of Itron&rsquo;s Grid Edge Intelligence portfolio. It is designed to manage the increasing number of DERs, including residential batteries, solar panels and EV chargers.<br /><br />On Dec. 2, 2024, Itron collaborated with Jemena &mdash; a major Australian provider of gas and electricity services. Together, will deploy Itron&rsquo;s LV DERMS to manage rooftop solar generation, enhance energy system resilience and address the challenges posed by Australia&#39;s growing solar penetration.</p><h2>What Does Our Model Predict for ITRI?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for ITRI this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.<br /><br />ITRI has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><h2>Stocks With Favorable Combination</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some stocks you may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this season.<br /><br /><strong>Trex Company, Inc.</strong> TREX has an Earnings ESP of +20.00% and a Zacks Rank of 2. TREX is set to release quarterly results on Feb. 24. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />TREX&rsquo;s long-term earnings growth rate is 11.73%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $159.2 million, which implies a year-over-year decrease of 18.7%. Shares of TRX plunged 27% in the past year.<br /><br /><strong>TopBuild Corp. </strong>BLD has an Earnings ESP of +1.28% and a Zacks Rank #3. BLD is set to release quarterly results on Feb. 25.<br /><br />BLD&rsquo;s long-term earnings growth rate is 7.42%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $5.08 per share, which implies a year-over-year increase of 8.3%. Shares of BLD plunged 16.1% in the past year.<br /><br /><strong>Dycom Industries, Inc.</strong> DY currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.97% and a Zacks Rank of 2. DY is set to release quarterly results on Feb. 26.<br /><br />DY&rsquo;s long-term earnings growth rate is 16.49%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 91 cents per share, which implies a year-over-year increase of 15.2%. Shares of DY soared 54.4% in the past year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418533/itron-gears-up-to-report-q4-earnings-here-s-what-to-expect?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2418533">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Inter Parfums' Q4 Earnings on Deck: Key Factors You Should Understand ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 14:20:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Inter Parfums, Inc. </strong>IPAR is likely to register bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 earnings on Feb. 25. Although the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has moved down a penny in the past 30 days to 80 cents per share, the projection indicates an increase from 32 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $5.14 per share, suggesting an 8.2% increase from the previous year&rsquo;s reported figure. IPAR has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 3.8%, on average.<br /><br /><em><strong>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Things to Know About IPAR&rsquo;s Upcoming Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Inter Parfums is experiencing growth driven by increasing demand for its products and a robust brand portfolio. A strategic focus on innovation and product launches has been helping the company stay firm amid a dynamic, competitive and growing marketplace. An expanding e-commerce presence has been yielding. The continuation of these trends bodes well for the to-be-reported quarter&rsquo;s performance. Management expects earnings per share (EPS) of $5.15 for full-year 2024.<br /><br />Despite the global fragrance market&#39;s continued vibrancy and robust demand, the company&rsquo;s sell-in has been slower than its sell-out, with retailers adopting a leaner inventory approach. While this is partly due to industry-wide destocking, the lag in sell-in could indicate weakening demand momentum. The persistence of this trend poses a risk to the company&rsquo;s fourth-quarter results.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Interparfums, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Interparfums, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/c0/1740049327.png" title="" width="537" /> <p>Interparfums, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Interparfums, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">A Look at IPAR&rsquo;s Sales Numbers</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Inter Parfums recently came out with its sales results for the fourth quarter and 2024, highlighting strong performance driven by the strength of its brands. For the fourth quarter of 2024, Interparfums achieved a 10% increase in net sales, reaching $362 million. On a full-year basis, too, net sales rose 10% to $1.452 billion.<br /><br />The company saw solid growth, driven by strong demand for its key brands. GUESS, its top-performing U.S.-based brand, delivered impressive results. IPAR&#39;s top six brands, which account for about 70% of net sales, experienced a 5% increase in the fourth quarter and a 4% rise for the full year. The newer additions, Lacoste and Roberto Cavalli made significant contributions to sales, accounting for 8% of quarterly sales improvement and 9% of full-year growth.<br /><br />Europe-based net sales were $214 million in the fourth quarter, a 6% increase from the prior period, and reached $953 million for the full year, up 10% from 2023. This growth was driven by the strong performance of Jimmy Choo, the addition of Lacoste and effective execution across smaller brands. Interparfums saw a notable 11% increase in sales for Jimmy Choo during the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year. The company&rsquo;s newest European brand, Lacoste, surpassed expectations, achieving $85 million in sales during its first year.<br /><br />In the fourth quarter of 2024, Interparfums&rsquo; U.S.-based net sales reached $149 million, indicating a robust 16% year-over-year increase. For the full year, U.S.-based net sales rose 12% to $511 million from the prior year. This growth was fueled by strong performances from GUESS, Donna Karan/DKNY and the addition of Roberto Cavalli.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Whispers for IPAR Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model doesn&rsquo;t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Inter Parfums this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />Inter Parfums carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of -2.64%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Some Stocks With the Favorable Combination</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some companies worth considering, as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.<br /><br /><strong>General Mills</strong> GIS currently has an Earnings ESP of +7.77% and a Zacks Rank #3. GIS is anticipated to register a decline in its top and bottom lines when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2025 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Mills&rsquo; quarterly revenues is pegged at $5.1 billion, indicating a decline of 0.8% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Mills&rsquo; bottom line has been stable in the past seven days at $1.03 per share. The consensus estimate for GIS suggests a decline of 12% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. GIS has delivered an earnings beat of 7.8%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.<br /><br /><strong>Freshpet, Inc.</strong> FRPT currently has an Earnings ESP of +14.67% and a Zacks Rank #2. FRPT is scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Feb. 20.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FRPT&rsquo;s to-be-reported quarter&rsquo;s earnings and revenues is pegged at 44 cents per share and $263.5 million, respectively. Shares of FRPT have gained 46.3% in the past year.<br /><br /><strong>Grocery Outlet Holding </strong>GO currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.32% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is likely to register a decrease in the bottom line when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings per share is pegged at 17 cents, down 5.6% from the year-ago period.<br /><br />Grocery Outlet&#39;s top line is expected to rise year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.09 billion, which suggests an increase of 9.7% from the prior-year quarter. GO has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 2.2%, on average.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418532/inter-parfums-q4-earnings-on-deck-key-factors-you-should-understand?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2418532">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd.</strong> GILT has announced the formation of its new Defense Division to address the increasing demand for secure government and military SATCOM (Satellite Communications) solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Gilat Defense unifies the expertise of Gilat, Gilat DataPath and Gilat Wavestream under one umbrella to deliver end-to-end, mission-critical SATCOM solutions for military, homeland security and government agencies. With a strong focus on supporting the U.S. Department of Defense (&ldquo;DoD&rdquo;), NATO and allied forces, the division ensures high-performance, battle-proven connectivity in the toughest environments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Gilat Defense will make its official debut at Satellite 2025 in Washington, DC, where attendees will have the opportunity to explore its latest innovations. Among the event&rsquo;s key highlights are the newly launched GLT 1500 terminal, DataPath 2.6m antenna and the U.S.-made Aquarius DS Family of products, including Aquarius Pro DS and Aquarius E DS. These products are compliant with FAR 889 and future DFAR 5949 regulations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the launch of Gilat&rsquo;s Defense Division, the company is reinforcing its commitment to providing advanced, secure and resilient SATCOM solutions that meet evolving defense needs.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. Price and Consensus</h3> <img alt="Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. Price and Consensus" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/a8/1740056668.png" title="" width="562" /> <p>Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. price-consensus-chart | Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Based in Petah Tikva, Israel, GILT is a top provider of satellite-based broadband services, including designing and manufacturing advanced equipment and innovative technology. Gilat&rsquo;s solutions support a range of applications, including broadband access, cellular backhaul, enterprise services, In-Flight Connectivity (IFC), maritime, trains, defense and public safety, all while meeting high service standards. Strength in the defense sector bodes well for Gilat, especially as demand for defense SATCOM solutions grows due to NGSO expansion and geopolitical events.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As part of its long-term strategy, Gilat plans to increase investments in R&amp;D, sales and marketing within the Defense segment. This will allow the company to capitalize on emerging opportunities more efficiently while reinforcing its leadership in satellite communications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Gilat recently released fourth-quarter 2024 financial results. Its Satellite Network revenues accounted for 62.8% of total net sales, amounting to $49.1 million. This marked a decline from the previous year&rsquo;s $53.5 million, primarily due to the company&rsquo;s exit from the Russian market. Despite this, Gilat remains focused on expanding its portfolio of secure satellite solutions tailored for government and military applications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To streamline operations and enhance market focus, Gilat has restructured its organization into three primary divisions, effective Jan. 1, 2025. Moving forward, financial results will be reported under the categories of Gilat Defense, Gilat Commercial and Gilat Peru. This restructuring will provide greater transparency for investors while allowing Gilat to focus on key market segments more efficiently.</p><h2>Gilat&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Stock Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">GILT currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of the company have surged 45.8% in the past six months compared with the Zacks Satellite and Communication industry&#39;s growth of 43.5%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/76/94589.jpg?v=1795234841" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Other Stocks to Consider in Computer Technology Space</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other stocks from the broader technology space are <strong>InterDigital, Inc</strong>.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">U.S. stock ended higher on Wednesday, with the S&amp;P 500 closing at a fresh record high, as investors assessed the minutes from the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s January policy meeting and weighed President Donald Trump&rsquo;s tariff threats. All three major indexes ended in positive territory. </span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">How Did The Benchmarks Perform?</span></span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 0.2% or 71.25 points, to end at 44,627.59 points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The S&amp;P 500 added 0.2% or 14.57 points, to finish at 6,144.15 points. Healthcare, utilities and consumer staples were the biggest gainers.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) added 0.5%, while the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) rose 1.3%. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) gained 0.8%.

Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.1-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored declining issues. A total of 16.36 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 15.57 billion.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Investors Assess Minutes of Fed&rsquo;s Meeting, Trump&rsquo;s Tariff Plans</span></span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Markets have been volatile over the past few weeks after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged in its January FOIMC meeting. On Wednesday, investors closely scrutinized the minutes of the Fed&rsquo;s January policy meeting which revealed that policymakers are concerned about stubbornly high inflation.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Also, Fed officials are concerned about the potential effect of Trump&rsquo;s tariffs.

<![CDATA[ Is the Options Market Predicting a Spike in Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX) Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 14:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc.</strong> TSLX need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 20, 2025 $30.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is Implied Volatility?</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What do the Analysts Think?</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Sixth Street Specialty Lending share, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Sixth Street Specialty Lending is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Financial - Mortgage &amp; Related Servicesindustry that ranks in the Bottom 44% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their estimate for the current quarter, while two have revised their estimate downwards. Our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter earnings has remained flat at 56 cents over the past 60 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the way analysts feel about Sixth Street Specialty Lending right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Looking to Trade Options?</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Click to see the trades now &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418495/is-the-options-market-predicting-a-spike-in-sixth-street-specialty-lending-tslx-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|options-2418495">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ KDP Poised to Report Q4 Earnings: Is a Surprise in the Cards? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. </strong>KDP is poised to release fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 25, before market open. Analysts are anticipating another decent performance from this beverage and coffee company with a year-over-year increase in revenues and earnings per share.</p><p><strong>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></p><p>For fourth-quarter revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.03 billion, indicating a 4.2% increase from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s figure. The consensus estimate for quarterly earnings has moved down a penny in the past 30 days to 57 cents per share. This figure calls for a 3.6% increase from the prior-year period. Also, the company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.4%, on average.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Keurig Dr Pepper, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Keurig Dr Pepper, Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/9c/1740054568.png" title="" width="568" /> <p>Keurig Dr Pepper, Inc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Keurig Dr Pepper, Inc Quote</p></div><h2>Key Factors to Note Ahead of KDP&rsquo;s Results</h2><p>Keurig&rsquo;s consumer-focused innovation model, supported by comprehensive scorecards tracking awareness, household penetration and loyalty, is expected to have driven continued market share gains in the to-be-reported quarter. The company&#39;s strategic focus on innovation, brand activity and strong commercial execution, combined with disciplined capital management and cost efficiency, positions it well for sustained growth across key categories such as liquid refreshment beverages, K-Cup pods and brewers.<br /><br />Building on its successful expansion efforts, KDP&#39;s recent asset integration in Arizona and its extended distribution footprint in Tennessee are set to further enhance its operational reach and market presence. In Mexico, the company-owned Direct Store Delivery network continues to provide a significant competitive advantage in a market heavily reliant on traditional trade. The ongoing investments in expanding system coverage, adding selling routes and increasing cooler placements have already demonstrated strong growth trends, and these efforts are expected to yield further positive momentum in the to-be-reported quarter.<br /><br />On its last earnings call, management reaffirmed its full-year guidance, alongside initiating projects to sustain growth over multiple years. The company expects 2024 constant-currency net sales growth in the mid-single digits. It continues to envision adjusted earnings per share growth in the high-single digits.<br /><br />Keurig has been experiencing strong momentum in its Refreshment Beverages segment, which has been a key growth driver. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment is pegged at $2.4 billion, representing a significant 4.7% year-over-year increase. This growth was led by strong sales and a good mix of products, helped by completing the transition of Electrolit. Results were driven by growth CSDs, thanks to affordable prices and strategic marketing. Continuation of this trend will aid the company&rsquo;s top line in the near term.<br /><br />KDP&rsquo;s strong market share momentum is expected to continue in the upcoming quarter, driven by successful innovation, brand strength and strategic marketing. Dr Pepper&rsquo;s popularity, fueled by its creamy coconut flavor and expanding zero-sugar options, will likely gain further traction, especially with the ongoing Fansville football campaign. Canada Dry&rsquo;s Fruit Splash, 7UP&rsquo;s refreshed look and Shirley Temple flavor are generating social media buzz, supporting continued category growth.</p><h2>What the Zacks Model Unveils for KDP</h2><p>Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Keurig this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />Keurig currently has an Earnings ESP of -0.93% and a Zacks Rank #3.</p><h2>Valuation Picture of KDP Stock</h2><p>From a valuation perspective, Keurig stock is trading at a discount relative to historical and industry benchmarks. With a forward 12-month price-to-earnings of 15.98x, below the five-year high of 23.33x, and the Beverages - Soft drinks industry&rsquo;s average of 18.41x, the stock offers compelling value for investors seeking exposure to the sector.<br /><br />Keurig shares have shown a upward trend, gaining 1.7% in the past three months, as compared the industry&rsquo;s growth of 2.3%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b0/94577.jpg?v=1826484867" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Stocks With the Favorable Combination</h2><p>Here are some companies that, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.<br /><br /><strong>Hormel Foods Corporation </strong>HRL currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly revenues is pegged at $2.9 billion, indicating a 2% decline from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong><br /><br />The consensus estimate for HRL&rsquo;s first-quarter 2025 earnings is pegged at 38 cents per share, implying a 7.3% decrease from the year-earlier quarter. The consensus mark has been stable in the past seven days.<br /><br /><strong>General Mills </strong>GIS currently has an Earnings ESP of +7.77% and a Zacks Rank #3. GIS is anticipated to register a decline in its top and bottom lines when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2025 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Mills&rsquo; quarterly revenues is pegged at $5.1 billion, indicating a decline of 0.8% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Mills&rsquo; bottom line has been stable in the past seven days at $1.03 per share. The consensus estimate for GIS suggests a decline of 12% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. GIS has delivered an earnings beat of 7.8%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.<br /><br /><strong>Grocery Outlet Holding</strong> GO currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.32% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is likely to register a decline in the bottom line when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings per share is pegged at 17 cents, down 5.6% from the year-ago period.</p><p>Grocery Outlet&#39;s top line is expected to rise year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.09 billion, which suggests an increase of 9.7% from the prior-year quarter. GO has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 2.2%, on average.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418493/kdp-poised-to-report-q4-earnings-is-a-surprise-in-the-cards?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2418493">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Is Broadcom Stock a Better Investment Pick Than NVIDIA Now? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:59:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The technology space is witnessing an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven surge, with industry leaders <strong>NVIDIA</strong> NVDA and <strong>Broadcom</strong> AVGO at the forefront. However, these two companies operate under vastly different business models. While NVIDIA is deeply dependent on AI chips, Broadcom boasts a diversified portfolio across multiple markets. This raises a critical question for investors: Is Broadcom the wiser investment choice than NVIDIA?</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA: AI-Centric Growth &amp; Potential Risks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA has seen explosive growth, with the third-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues reaching $35.08 billion, marking a 94% year-over-year increase. The AI revolution primarily fuels this surge, as its Data Center segment alone generated $30.8 billion, accounting for 88% of total revenues and growing 112% year over year. Notably, the demand for H100 and H200 GPUs, which power AI training and inference, continues to skyrocket. Moreover, NVIDIA&rsquo;s next-generation Blackwell architecture is expected to sustain this momentum, solidifying its leadership in AI infrastructure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, this aggressive AI-driven expansion comes with significant risks. Since AI chips form the backbone of NVIDIA&rsquo;s business, any slowdown in AI demand could lead to a sharp revenue decline. While the company is making strides in software and services, hardware remains its dominant revenue source, leaving it vulnerable to fluctuations in AI spending.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Market volatility poses another challenge. Supply chain constraints could disrupt production and delay product rollouts, affecting revenue growth. Furthermore, the industry may experience AI spending digestion&mdash;a phase where companies scale back investments after an initial surge in AI infrastructure build-out. This could temper demand for NVIDIA&rsquo;s chips, making its current growth trajectory less predictable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite these risks, NVIDIA&rsquo;s position as the leading AI hardware provider gives it a strong competitive advantage. Continued technological innovation, expansion into enterprise AI software and increasing adoption of AI across industries will be crucial in sustaining its long-term growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Broadcom: A More Diversified and Stable Business Model</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike NVIDIA, Broadcom has a more balanced business portfolio, which provides insulation against market fluctuations. For the fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom reported $14.05 billion in revenues, up 51.2% year over year. While Broadcom&rsquo;s AI revenues are growing rapidly &mdash; up 220% year over year to $12.2 billion &mdash; it only accounts for 41% of the company&rsquo;s semiconductor revenues, making Broadcom less vulnerable to a potential AI slowdown.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">One of Broadcom&rsquo;s biggest strengths is diversification across multiple technology sectors. The company&rsquo;s networking segment, particularly AI connectivity solutions using Ethernet, is seeing strong growth and is expected to reach a $60 billion to $90 billion market by 2027.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Broadcom&rsquo;s acquisition of VMware has transformed it into a major player in enterprise software, adding $5.8 billion to fourth-quarter revenues. This segment provides recurring income and acts as a buffer against hardware market fluctuations. Broadcom also generates revenues from wireless technologies (RF, WiFi, Bluetooth), broadband and server storage, further strengthening its stability.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion: Growth vs. Stability</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the short term, NVIDIA presents a more attractive growth opportunity due to its dominance in AI hardware. The company&rsquo;s cutting-edge GPU technology and massive AI infrastructure investments make it a key player in the industry. However, this rapid expansion also means higher risks, especially if AI demand slows or competitors gain market share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Broadcom offers a more balanced and diversified approach. While its AI business is growing, it is not the sole driver of revenues, reducing potential downside risks. Its strong presence in networking, software (via VMware) and wireless solutions ensures long-term financial stability, even if AI spending cools down.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For investors, the choice between NVIDIA and Broadcom depends on risk appetite. Those looking for explosive AI-driven growth may favor NVIDIA &ndash; carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) &ndash; while those seeking a safer, more diversified semiconductor play may find #2 Ranked Broadcom a more resilient long-term investment.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Krystal Biotech</strong>&nbsp;KRYS reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.52, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 as Vyjuvek gains traction in the U.S. market. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported earnings of 30 cents per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar </em></strong><strong><em>to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, revenues totaled $91.1 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $97 million. Revenues came in solely from the sales of Vyjuvek. In the year-ago quarter, revenues amounted to $42.1 million.</p><h2>KRYS&rsquo; Q4 Results in Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2023, the FDA approved Vyjuvek, the first-ever revocable gene therapy for treating patients aged six months or older with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (&ldquo;DEB&rdquo;). DEB is a rare and severe monogenic disease that affects the skin and mucosal tissues.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Light &amp; Wonder, Inc.</strong> LNW recently entered into a definitive agreement with Grover Gaming to acquire the latter&rsquo;s charitable Gaming Assets for $850 million cash and an additional four-year revenue-based earn out of up to $200 million cash. LNW will fund the acquisition with a combination of incremental debt financing and existing cash. The company expects the net debt leverage ratio will remain within the target range of 2.5x to 3.5x, post buyout.<br /><br />The transaction subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2025. For 2025, the company reiterated Consolidated AEBITDA target of $1.4 billion backed by solid market traction across its businesses.</p><h2>Will LNW Stock Benefit From This Acquisition?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Headquartered in Greenville, NC, Grover Charitable Gaming has a strong presence in the fast-growing charitable gaming space. It operates around 10,000 leased electronic pull-tab units across five U.S. States. In fiscal 2024 the company registered revenues of $135 million with adjusted EBITDA of $111 million.

The company is expected to derive high single-digit adjusted NPATA (Net Profit After Tax and Amortization) in the first full calendar year post acquisition.<br /><br />Strategic acquisitions have been a key part of Light &amp; Wonder&rsquo;s growth story over the years. Earlier acquisitions of Bally Technologies, WMS Industries, Parspro and Provoloto, Barcrest Group Limited, Sceptre Leisure Solutions and GameLogic have expanded the company&rsquo;s ability to offer computerized systems and services to the global gaming industry.<br /><br />With the acquisition of DEQ Systems, LNW benefited from the former&rsquo;s EZ Baccarat, which has about 800 table games in 150 casinos globally. Tech Art expanded LNW&rsquo;s gaming portfolio as well as strengthened its foothold in the international market. The buyout of the privately held mobile and social game company, Come2Play, expanded and diversified SciPlay segment&rsquo;s existing portfolio of social games.</p><h2>LNW Stock&rsquo;s Price Movement</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of LNW have gained 20.2% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 23.9%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/64/94573.jpg?v=1984374317" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>LNW&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Light &amp; Wonder currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).<br /><br />Some better-ranked stocks in the broader industry have been discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Keysight Technologies, Inc.</strong> KEYS has a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy) at present.

<![CDATA[ Is the Options Market Predicting a Spike in First Business Financial Services (FBIZ) Stock? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>First Business Financial Services, Inc.</strong> FBIZ need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Mar 21, 2025 $25.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What is Implied Volatility?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What do the Analysts Think?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for First Business Financial Services shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, First Business Financial Services is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Banks - Midwest industry that ranks in the Top 2% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of $1.19 per share to $1.29 in that period.<br /><br />Given the way analysts feel about First Business Financial Services right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Looking to Trade Options?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.<br /><br /><strong>Click to see the trades now &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418419/is-the-options-market-predicting-a-spike-in-first-business-financial-services-fbiz-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|options-2418419">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Palo Alto Networks Soars 13% YTD: Time to Buy, Hold or Sell the Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Palo Alto Networks, Inc.</strong> PANW has delivered a 12.7% year-to-date (YTD) gain, but this underperforms the Zacks Security industry, which has risen 19.8% over the same period. Key competitors like <strong>CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.</strong> CRWD, <strong>CyberArk Software Ltd.</strong> CYBR and <strong>Fortinet Inc.</strong> FTNT have all outpaced PANW&rsquo;s gains, reflecting investor concerns over slowing revenue growth and a deceleration in next-generation security (NGS) annual recurring revenues (ARR).</p><h3>YTD Price Return Performance</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/58/94570.jpg?v=2075686512" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite these near-term challenges, Palo Alto Networks remains a strong long-term investment, thanks to its leadership in cybersecurity, innovation in AI-driven security solutions and strategic shift toward a platform-based model. While the immediate upside may be limited, the stock is not one to sell, making it a hold for now.</p><h2>Why Did Palo Alto Networks Underperform?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Palo Alto Networks has faced a noticeable slowdown in revenue growth, raising concerns about its near-term trajectory. In fiscal 2024, revenues grew 16% year over year, a steep decline from the 25% growth recorded in fiscal 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This deceleration is expected to continue into fiscal 2025, with the company forecasting full-year revenue growth of just 14% in the range of $9.14 billion-$9.19 billion. So far, first-quarter and second-quarter revenue growth has hovered around 14%, in line with this cautious outlook. Analysts project mid-teen percentage growth through fiscal 2026, reinforcing the view that PANW&rsquo;s rapid expansion phase is cooling off.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another concern is the slowing growth of NGS ARR, a key metric for Palo Alto Networks&#39; long-term financial health. The company has reported four consecutive quarters of declining NGS ARR growth, with fiscal 2025 projections suggesting a further slowdown to 31-32% growth. While this is still impressive, we had hoped for stronger momentum, given the increasing demand for cloud security and AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.</p><p><img alt="Palo Alto Networks, Inc." src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/0c/94571.jpg?v=1800287114" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Palo Alto Networks, Inc.</span></p><h2>The Long-Term Outlook Remains Strong for PANW</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite these near-term challenges, Palo Alto Networks is well-positioned for long-term growth as cybersecurity threats continue to become more complex and frequent. According to a Fortune Business Insights report, the global cybersecurity market is expected to expand from $193.73 billion in 2024 to $562.72 billion by 2032, creating a massive opportunity for companies with best-in-class security solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Palo Alto Networks has continued to innovate, focusing on AI, automation and cloud security to stay ahead of the competition. Its partnership with NVIDIA to develop AI-driven private 5G security solutions highlights its commitment to emerging technologies and next-generation security demands.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s platformization strategy has also been a game-changer. Instead of relying on one-off product sales, Palo Alto Networks has transitioned to a bundled cybersecurity platform approach, which enhances recurring revenues and customer retention. This strategy ensures financial stability and predictable growth, making PANW a top choice for enterprises seeking long-term security solutions.</p><h2>PANW&rsquo;s Valuation is Becoming More Attractive</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For investors looking for a high-quality cybersecurity stock, Palo Alto Networks is trading at a more reasonable valuation compared to its peers. The stock&rsquo;s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 59.97 is significantly lower than the industry average of 110.98, suggesting that PANW is not as overvalued as some of its competitors. CrowdStrike and CyberArk are trading at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 102.01 and 110.24, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, its forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 13.6 is also below the industry average of 15.01, reinforcing the view that investors are getting a solid long-term play at a better price than before. While these valuations aren&rsquo;t cheap by traditional standards, they reflect the company&rsquo;s strong fundamentals and premium positioning in the cybersecurity space.</p><h3>Forward 12-Month P/S Ratio</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/e7/94572.jpg?v=1525649004" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Conclusion: Hold PANW Stock for Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Palo Alto Networks remains a leader in cybersecurity, with a strong long-term growth trajectory, continued AI-driven innovation and a shift toward a more predictable recurring revenue model. However, slowing revenue growth and NGS ARR deceleration suggest that near-term upside may be limited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For now, investors should hold PANW stock, watching for any signs of re-acceleration in revenue growth or an improved outlook on NGS ARR before considering adding more exposure. While long-term prospects remain highly attractive, the stock&rsquo;s recent underperformance and cautious outlook warrant patience rather than aggressive buying.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, Palo Alto Networks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. </strong>REXR need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the April 17, 2025 $25 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h2>What is Implied Volatility?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h2>What do the Analysts Think?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Rexford Industrial shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Rexford Industrial is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the REIT and Equity Trust &ndash; Other industry that ranks in the Bottom 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analyst increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one has dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 60 cents per share to 58 cents in that period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the way analysts feel about Rexford Industrial right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><h2>Looking to Trade Options?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

<![CDATA[ Cloudflare Soars 49% YTD: Should You Hold or Fold the Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:34:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cloudflare, Inc.</strong> NET has been one of the standout performers in the tech sector, surging 49.2% year to date. The stock has significantly outpaced the Zacks Internet &ndash; Software industry, which has risen 3% during the same period. Cloudflare&rsquo;s rally has also overshadowed its peers, including <strong>Five9, Inc.</strong> FIVN, <strong>Atlassian Corporation</strong> TEAM and <strong>Twilio Inc.</strong> TWLO.</p><h3>YTD Price Return Performance</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c5/94565.jpg?v=417295244" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given this impressive run, investors are now left wondering: Should they continue holding Cloudflare or take profits off the table? While valuation concerns and market volatility exist, Cloudflare&rsquo;s strong fundamentals, expanding enterprise adoption and AI-driven growth initiatives make it a compelling hold for long-term investors.</p><h2>Cloudflare&rsquo;s Robust Q4 Results Signal Continued Strength</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier in February, Cloudflare delivered another solid quarter, reinforcing its position as a leader in web security, networking and cloud-based services. The company reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenues of $459.9 million, up 27% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%. Earnings per share of 19 cents also soared 26.7% and surpassed the consensus mark by 5.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">A key highlight was the 27% year-over-year growth in large customers, with 3,497 enterprise clients now spending more than $100,000 annually on Cloudflare&rsquo;s services. Revenue contribution from large customers climbed to 69% of total sales, up from 66% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a growing adoption of Cloudflare&rsquo;s comprehensive cloud security and networking solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Importantly, Cloudflare&rsquo;s dollar-based net retention rate improved one percentage point sequentially to 111%, signaling that existing customers are increasing their spending, a crucial indicator of long-term revenue sustainability.</p><h2>AI and Security-Driven Growth: NET&rsquo;s Major Competitive Edge</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Cloudflare is benefiting from strong demand in cybersecurity, AI-driven automation and enterprise cloud adoption. The company&rsquo;s Zero Trust security framework, which protects businesses from cyber threats, has gained significant traction. Cloudflare secured a three-year $4 million SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) contract with a major U.S. investment firm during the fourth quarter, strengthening its position in enterprise security.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AI is also becoming a transformative growth catalyst for Cloudflare. The company&rsquo;s Workers AI and AI Gateway are helping businesses optimize performance and security for AI workloads. Cloudflare&rsquo;s AI-driven inference capabilities, combined with serverless computing, allow enterprises to scale AI applications efficiently and cost-effectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">During the last earnings call, management revealed that Cloudflare&rsquo;s AI offerings provide up to 10 times price-performance improvements for businesses, a clear advantage over traditional hyperscalers. As AI adoption accelerates, Cloudflare&rsquo;s multi-cloud and edge computing capabilities make it a critical infrastructure player in this evolving landscape.</p><h2>Cloudflare&rsquo;s Improved Sales Execution Drives Customer Wins</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Cloudflare&rsquo;s go-to-market execution has improved significantly, thanks to leadership changes and strategic hiring. The company revealed that approximately 80% of new sales representative hires in the fourth quarter were in the enterprise segment, setting the stage for accelerated deal-making in 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Several high-profile customer wins highlight Cloudflare&rsquo;s growing market presence. A Fortune 100 technology firm signed a five-year $20 million contract, while a leading AI company expanded its Cloudflare partnership with a $13.5 million deal. These deals indicate strong enterprise adoption of Cloudflare&rsquo;s platform and validate its long-term growth strategy.</p><h2>Cloudflare&rsquo;s Profitability and Cash Flow Trend Remain Strong</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Cloudflare&rsquo;s fourth-quarter 2024 operating profit jumped 69% year over year to $67.2 million, with an operating margin of 14.6%, marking a 360 basis-point improvement. Free cash flow for the quarter stood at $47.8 million and $166.9 million for full-year 2024, reflecting Cloudflare&rsquo;s ability to grow while maintaining financial discipline.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2025, Cloudflare is guiding for 25% year-over-year revenue growth, with expected sales of $2.90-$2.94 billion. The company is also increasing its capital expenditure investments in AI infrastructure, positioning itself for sustained long-term expansion. Management anticipates capital expenditure to be 12-13% of total revenues in 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2025, management forecasts EPS in the range of 79-80 cents. The consensus mark of 2025 EPS indicates growth of 6.7% and further acceleration in 2026 with an estimated increase of 26.7%. Cloudflare has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 20.7%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Cloudflare, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><h2> <img alt="Cloudflare, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/7d/1740051460.png" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" title="" /> </h2><p>Cloudflare, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Cloudflare, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2>Cloudflare&rsquo;s Premium Valuation: A Key Concern</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Although Cloudflare has performed exceptionally and has strong fundamentals, its current valuation raises concerns. While NET has shown impressive growth in customer acquisition and product innovation, such momentum has already been priced into the stock&rsquo;s valuation, leaving limited room for error.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At present, NET appears overvalued from a price-to-sales perspective. The stock is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/S ratio of 25.41, significantly higher than the industry average of 5.1. This premium valuation raises concerns about the stock&rsquo;s sustainability, signaling potential downward risk.</p><h3>Forward 12-Month P/S Ratio</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/07/94566.jpg?v=1330604297" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Conclusion: Hold Cloudflare Stock for Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Cloudflare&rsquo;s 49% YTD rally has been well-earned, supported by robust revenue growth, improving profitability and rising enterprise adoption. While the stock&rsquo;s high valuation introduces short-term volatility risks, its long-term fundamentals remain compelling.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With continued strength in AI, security and cloud networking, Cloudflare is well-positioned to sustain its momentum. Long-term investors should hold the stock, capitalizing on future upside potential as the company scales its AI-driven solutions and strengthens its enterprise foothold.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, Cloudflare carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418396/cloudflare-soars-49-ytd-should-you-hold-or-fold-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2418396">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Exact Sciences Corporation </strong>EXAS reported a net loss of 6 cents in the fourth quarter of 2024, much narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 32 cents.

The reported figure was also wider than the 2023 loss of $1.13 per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consolidated revenues totaled $713.4 million, up 10.3% on a reported basis and 11% on a core revenue basis. The figure slightly came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.02%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues in 2024 were $2.76 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4% and increasing 10.4% from 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Following the announcement, EXAS shares plunged 3.9% in the after-hours trading yesterday.</p><h2>Segmental Review of EXAS&rsquo; Q4 Revenues</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Screening revenues, including laboratory service revenues from Cologuard and PreventionGenetics, totaled $552.6 million. The figure increased 14% year over year, driven by the momentum in Cologuard adoption among providers, health systems and payers.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Exact Sciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Exact Sciences Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/3d/1740044215.png" title="" width="571" /> <p>Exact Sciences Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Exact Sciences Corporation Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Precision Oncology revenues, including laboratory service revenues from global Oncotype products and therapy selection products, were $160.9 million, a marginal increase from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s figure. This upside was propelled by the increased adoption of Oncotype DX internationally.</p><h2>EXAS&rsquo; Q4 Margin Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Exact Sciences&rsquo; gross profit rose 8.5% year over year to $492.6 million despite a 14.4% rise in the cost of revenues (excluding the amortization of acquired intangibles).

General and administrative expenses declined 2.7% year over year to $191 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, the adjusted operating loss totaled $40.8 million compared with the year-ago operating loss of $74.2 million.</p><h2>EXAS&rsquo; Financial Update</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Exact Sciences exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.04 billion compared with $777.6 million at the end of 2023.</p><h2>Exact Sciences Initiates 2025 View</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For full-year 2025, the company anticipates total revenues in the range of $3.025-$3.085 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.08 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Among these, Screening revenues are expected in the range of $2.350-$2.390 billion. Precision Oncology revenues are expected between $675 million and $695 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted EBITDA is forecast in the range of $410-$440 million.</p><h2>Our Take on EXAS</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Exact Sciences exited the fourth quarter of 2024 with both earnings and revenues surpassing the respective estimates. The expanding customer base for the Cologuard test remains a key performance driver. The company continues to see strong adoption of Oncotype DX internationally as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Among major pipeline advancements, EXAS secured favorable Medicare pricing for the Cologuard Plus test, enhancing its screening capabilities.

<![CDATA[ Chemours' Earnings Outpace Estimates, Revenues Miss in Q4 ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Chemours Company</strong> CC reported a net loss of $8 million or 5 cents per share for fourth-quarter 2024 compared with the year-ago quarter&#39;s loss of $18 million or 12 cents.<br /><br />Barring one-time items, earnings came in at 11 cents per share. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar</strong></em>.<br /><br />The company reported fourth-quarter net sales of $1,359 million, reflecting a 1% decline from the previous-year quarter. It fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,359.8 million. A gain in volume largely offset the drop in pricing, while the currency impact remained unchanged.<br /><br />Adjusted EBITDA rose 2% year over year to $179 million for the quarter. The rise in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to cost savings obtained through the Titanium Technologies Transformation Plan, favorable inventory adjustments and true-ups in Advanced Performance Materials and greater volumes in Thermal &amp; Specialized Solutions, slightly offset by reduced pricing across all businesses.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Chemours Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><h2 style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="The Chemours Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/8d/1740051089.png" title="" width="568" /> </h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Chemours Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Chemours Company Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CC&rsquo;s Segment Highlights</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Titanium Technologies division recorded revenues of $632 million in the quarter, marking a 3% decrease from the previous year. This surpassed our estimate of $614.2 million. This decline was primarily due to a 2% decrease in pricing and a 1% fall in volume, while the currency impact remained unchanged.<br /><br />In the Thermal &amp; Specialized Solutions segment, revenues saw a 3% year-over-year increase, reaching $390 million in the reported quarter, though it fell short of our estimate of $395.5 million. Net sales growth was mainly driven by a 7% increase in volume, slightly offset by a 4% fall in price, while the currency impact was unchanged. Volume growth was driven by increased demand for Opteon Refrigerant blends ahead of the US AIM Act&#39;s new low GWP stationary air conditioning equipment transition, which begins in 2025. The pricing decrease was mostly due to lower Freon Refrigerant prices as a result of increased market hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) inventories.<br /><br />Revenues in the Advanced Performance Materials unit amounted to $324 million, marking a decline of approximately 1% year over year. The figure missed our estimate of $335.6 million. The decline in sales was largely caused by a 3% drop in price, which was partially offset by a 2% increase in volume, while the currency impact was flat. The volume rise was due to a recent capacity expansion in Teflon PFA, which more than offset lower demand in the hydrogen market. The price fall was due to a product mix associated with more economically sensitive end markets across the segment.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CC&rsquo;s FY24 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For full-year 2024, Chemours reported net sales of $5,782 million, reflecting a 4.9% decline from the previous year. Adjusted net income was $182 million, a notable decrease from $425 million in the prior year. This resulted in an adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, down from $2.82 in the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $786 million compared with $1,014 million in the prior year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CC&rsquo;s Financials</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2024 was $138 million compared with $482 million in the prior-year quarter due to actions made by previous management a year ago. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $109 million compared with $135 million in the previous year&#39;s quarter due to higher capital expenditures on APM&#39;s Teflon PFA expansion in 2023. During the quarter, the company distributed $36 million in dividends to shareholders.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CC&rsquo;s Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company expects full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA between $825 million and $975 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $250 million and $300 million.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CC&rsquo;s Stock Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Chemours are down 39.7% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s fall of 0.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/df/94557.jpg?v=1459362433" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CC&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">CC currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).<br /><br />Better-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include <strong>ICL Group Ltd.&nbsp;</strong> ICL,<strong> Fortuna Mining Corp. </strong>FSM and <strong>Kronos Worldwide</strong> KRO.<br /><br />ICL is slated to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 6 cents. ICL beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with the average earnings surprise being 18.1%. ICL carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />Fortuna is scheduled to release fourth-quarter results on March 5. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FSM&rsquo;s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 16 cents. FSM, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, has gained around 64.6% in the past year. FSM beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, while missing twice with the average earnings surprise being 53.5%<br /><br />Kronos is expected to report fourth-quarter results on March 5. The consensus estimate for KRO&rsquo;s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 11 cents. KRO, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, beat the consensus estimate in three of the last four quarters while missing once, with the average earnings surprise being 41.7%.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418360/chemours-earnings-outpace-estimates-revenues-miss-in-q4?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418360">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Pick These 4 Stocks With Solid Net Profit Margin to Boost Return ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors prefer to invest in businesses that reap profits on a regular basis. To gauge the extent of profits, there is no better metric than net profit margin.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A higher net margin reflects a company&rsquo;s efficiency in converting sales into actual profits. <strong>Griffon Corporation</strong> GFF, <strong>BGC Group, Inc.</strong> BGC, <strong>ChampionX Corporation</strong> CHX and <strong>ChromaDex Corporation</strong> CDXC boast solid net profit margins.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Net Profit Margin = Net profit/Sales * 100.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In simple terms, net profit is the amount a company retains after deducting all costs, interest, depreciation, taxes and other expenses. In fact, the net profit margin can turn out to be a potent point of reference to gauge the strength of a company&rsquo;s operations and its cost-control measures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also, higher net profit is essential for rewarding stakeholders. Further, strength in the metric not only attracts investors but also draws well-skilled employees who eventually enhance a business&#39;s value.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, a higher net profit margin compared with its peers provides the company with a competitive edge.</p><h2>Pros and Cons</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Net profit margin helps investors gain clarity on a company&rsquo;s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and manufacturing efficiency. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, net profit margin as an investment criterion has its share of pitfalls. The metric varies widely from industry to industry. While net income is a key metric for investment measurement in traditional industries, it is not that important for technology companies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the difference in accounting treatment of various items &mdash; especially non-cash expenses like depreciation and stock-based compensation &mdash; makes comparison a daunting task.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, for companies preferring to grow with debt instead of equity funding, higher interest expenses usually weigh on net profit. In such cases, the measure is rendered ineffective while analyzing a company&rsquo;s performance.</p><h2>The Winning Strategy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A healthy net profit margin and solid EPS growth are the two most sought-after elements in a business model.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from these, we have added a few criteria to ensure maximum returns from this strategy.</p><h2>Screening Parameters</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Net Margin 12 months &ndash; Most Recent (%) greater than equal to 0:</strong> A high net profit margin indicates solid profitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/(F-1) greater than equal to 0:</strong> It indicates earnings growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Average Broker Rating (1-5) equal to 1:</strong> A rating of #1 indicates brokers&rsquo; extreme bullishness on the stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2:</strong> Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environments. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>VGM Score of A or B:</strong> Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here, we discuss our four picks from the 20 stocks that qualified the screening:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Griffon</strong> is a diversified holding company with exposure in several industries. The company engages in the manufacture and sale of a wide range of consumer and professional, and home and building products, including garage doors, shutters, materials for disposable diapers and disposable health care products.&nbsp; The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Griffon&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 4 cents to $5.55 per share over the past 30 days. GFF surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, the average surprise being 14.7%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BGC Group</strong> is a brokerage and financial technology company. Through its various affiliates, the company specializes in the brokerage of a broad range of products, including fixed income, foreign exchange, equities, energy and commodities, shipping and futures.&nbsp; The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 per share for BGC Group&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has moved 2 cents north in the past seven days. BGC surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate once in the trailing four quarters while matching the same on three occasions, the average surprise being 3.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ChampionX</strong> provides chemistry solutions and engineered equipment and technologies to companies that drill for and produce oil and gas. The stock carries a Zacks Rank of 2 at present and has a VGM Score of B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ChampionX&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has been revised upward to $1.92 per share from $1.90 in the past 60 days. CHX surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing on one occasion, the average surprise being 9.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ChromaDex</strong> supplies phytochemical reference standards and reference materials, related contract services, and products for the dietary supplement, nutraceutical, food and beverage, functional food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic markets.&nbsp; At present, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ChromaDex&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has remained unchanged over the past 60 days at 12 cents per share. CDXC surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 91.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">After a 23.4% rise over the past one year, the S&amp;P 500 has continued its bullish momentum this year. The S&amp;P 500 index reached a new all-time high lately, fueled by strong economic indicators, sector diversification, AI advancements, and a solid corporate earnings season. This rally persists despite concerns over a global trade war and uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve&#39;s rate cut plans.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s January meeting minutes revealed that officials agree inflation must decline further before cutting interest rates. But investors brushed off President Donald Trump&rsquo;s warning of potential new tariffs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Elyse Ausenbaugh, Head of Investment Strategy at JPMorgan Wealth Management, emphasized market resilience on CNBC&rsquo;s Closing Bell and believes 2025 will offer further growth opportunities as well as sees room for the market rally to continue.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Earnings Optimism </span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Total earnings for 74% of the S&amp;P 500 are up 12.1% from the same period last year on 5.6% higher revenues, with 77.8% beating EPS estimates and 64.6% beating revenue estimates. This is notably a better performance relative to other recent periods, particularly in terms of the growth pace.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Decent U.S. GDP Growth, If Not Upbeat</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at an annual rate of 2.3% in the fourth quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#39; (BEA) first estimate showed on Jan. 30, 2025.

Additionally, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index rose by 2.5% on a quarterly basis, matching the market consensus.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">AI Initiatives Going Strong </span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Major investments in AI and related technologies have fueled optimism about future productivity gains and economic growth. Businesses are committing significant capital to AI, expecting long-term benefits that support current market valuations.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Top Stocks of S&amp;P 500</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the fundamentals of <strong>iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF</strong> IVV. Then we will highlight the good-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks over the year-to-date frame and one-week period. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). This indicates that these stocks have chances for further outperformance.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">IVV in Focus</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The S&amp;P 500 Index measures the performance of the large-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market.

The fund IVV has a Zacks Rank #1.&nbsp;SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust has an AUM of $610.73 billion and charges 3 bps in fees per year (see:&nbsp;all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Below, we have highlighted the abovementioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ralph Lauren </strong>RL<strong> &ndash; Up 24.1% YTD, Up 5.4% Past Week &ndash; Zacks Rank #2</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ralph Lauren Corp. is a major designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products in North America, Europe, Asia, and internationally.

It, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,466.4 million.<br /><br />Average selling prices in 2024 were lower than in 2023 due to lower global energy costs, which reduced the global clearing price required to meet demand. Sales volumes for 2024 were similar to those in 2023, with higher ammonia sales volumes offset by lower urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN), ammonium nitrate (AN) and other sales volumes.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

Average selling price per product ton was $461, which beat our estimate of $414. Ammonia adjusted gross margin per ton dropped in 2024 from 2023, owing mostly to lower average selling prices and increased maintenance expenses, which were slightly offset by lower realized natural gas costs.<br /><br />Sales in the Granular Urea segment fell around 11.2% year over year to $348 million. It missed our estimate of $355.6 million. Average selling price per product ton was $347, which topped our estimate of $337.

Net sales declined around 10.5% year over year to $5,936 million.</p><h2>CF&rsquo;s Financials</h2><p>CF Industries ended 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,614 million, down around 20.6% year over year.<br /><br />Net cash provided by operating activities was $420 million in the reported quarter, down around 12.5% year over year.<br /><br />The company repurchased 18.8 million shares for $1.51 billion in 2024, including 4.4 million shares for $385 million in the fourth quarter of 2024.&nbsp;</p><h2>CF&rsquo;s Outlook</h2><p>In the near future, the company expects the global supply-demand balance to continue to be positive since inventories around the globe are considered to be below normal and production economics for the industry&#39;s marginal producers in Europe remain challenging.<br /><br />CF currently expects average U.S. corn returns to be higher than soybeans, owing in part to rising corn prices as a result of robust corn exports and lower 2024 yield predictions, which are projected to benefit corn plantings and nitrogen demand in the region.<br /><br />Nitrogen imports to Brazil are likely to remain high in 2025 due to anticipated high corn plantings and ongoing minimal domestic nitrogen output.<br /><br />Urea inventory in India is predicted to be low due to strong domestic demand for urea, lower-than-targeted domestic urea output and lower urea import volumes in 2024 compared to 2023.&nbsp;</p><h2>CF&rsquo;s Stock Price Performance</h2><p>Shares of CF Industries have gained 8.6% in the past year compared with a 2.2% rise of the industry.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3b/94556.jpg?v=2082499238" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>CF&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h2><p>CF currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).<br /><br />Better-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include <strong>ICL Group Ltd.&nbsp;</strong> ICL, <strong>Fortuna Mining Corp. </strong>FSM and <strong>Kronos Worldwide </strong>KRO.<br /><br />ICL is slated to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26.

<![CDATA[ Can Diamondback Energy Pull Off a Strong Show in Q4 Earnings? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Diamondback Energy</strong> FANG is set to release fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 24. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $3.26 per share on revenues of $3.4 billion.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em><br /><br />Let&rsquo;s delve into the factors that might have influenced the Permian-focused oil and gas producer&rsquo;s performance in the December quarter. But it&rsquo;s worth taking a look at FANG&rsquo;s previous-quarter performance first.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Highlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise History</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the last reported quarter, this Midland, TX-based upstream player missed the consensus mark due to a fall in overall realization. Diamondback had reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.38 in the third quarter, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.80. However, revenues of $2.6 billion went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.6% on strong production.<br /><br />FANG beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters and missed in the other. This is depicted in the graph below:</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Diamondback Energy, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Diamondback Energy, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/87/1740050253.png" title="" width="546" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Diamondback Energy, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Diamondback Energy, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Trend in Estimate Revision</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has been revised 0.9% downward in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 31.2% drop year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, however, suggests a 52.7% increase from the year-ago period.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Diamondback is sitting on about 476,000 net acres in the Delaware and Midland regions, with more than 8,000 drilling locations and production of more than 450,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Overall, the wells drilled by the company have extremely low oil price breakeven costs and need the commodity to be at just $40 a barrel to be profitable.<br /><br />In particular, Diamondback&rsquo;s $26 billion Endeavor Energy acquisition significantly strengthens its Permian Basin position. The deal provides access to high-quality acreage with lower production costs.<br /><br />Following the deal, Diamondback Energy is expected to have benefited from higher production during the fourth quarter. The company continues to churn out impressive volumes from its wide inventory of drill-ready locations in the Permian Basin &mdash; America&#39;s hottest and lowest-cost shale region. Consequently, our expectation for FANG&rsquo;s average fourth-quarter volume is pegged at 845,967.5 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), up 82.9% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level of 462,565 BOE/d.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why a Likely Positive Surprise?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Diamondback Energy this season.

<![CDATA[ Bet on Winning DuPont Analysis & Pick 3 Top Stocks ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:44:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Return on equity (ROE) is one of the most favored metrics of investors. It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity. Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns. Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play. It is an analytical method, which examines three major elements &ndash; operating management, management of assets and the capital structure &ndash; related to the financial condition of a company. Below we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ROE = Net Income/Equity<br /><br />Net Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)<br /><br />ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity Multiplier</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The screener yields winning stocks like <strong>EverQuote</strong> EVER, <strong>Blue Bird </strong>BLBD and <strong>Sprouts Farmers Market</strong> SFM.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Why Use DuPont?</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Although one can&rsquo;t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn&rsquo;t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, it also sheds light on the company&rsquo;s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company&rsquo;s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Screening Parameters</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; <strong>Profit Margin more than or equal to 3:</strong> As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.<br /><br />&bull; <strong>Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2:</strong> It allows an investor to assess management&rsquo;s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.<br /><br />&bull; <strong>Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3:</strong> It&rsquo;s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.<br /><br />&bull; <strong>Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2:</strong> Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environments.<br /><br />&bull; <strong>Current Price more than $5:</strong> This screens out the low-priced stocks. However, when looking for lower priced stocks, this criterion can be removed.<br /><br />Here are the three stocks that made it through the screen:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EverQuote</strong>: The Zacks Rank #1 company operates an online marketplace for consumers shopping for auto, home and renters and life insurance. EVER is presently reporting two main verticals &mdash; Auto and Home and Renters. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The average earnings surprise of EVER for the past four quarters is 149.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Blue Bird</strong>: This Zacks Rank #2 company is engaged in the designing, engineering, manufacturing and sale of school buses and related parts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The average earnings surprise of BLBD for the past four quarters is 49.64%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sprouts Farmers Market</strong>: The Zacks Rank #2 company operates in a highly fragmented grocery store industry, has a unique model that features fresh produce, foods section, and a vitamin department focused on overall wellness.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The average earnings surprise of SFM for the past four quarters is 15.29%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

<![CDATA[ RIVN or LCID: Which Stock is Better Positioned Pre-Q4 Earnings? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:39:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The electric vehicle (EV) industry is currently at crossroads. Though e-mobility is the future, President Trump&rsquo;s unfriendly stance on EVs, along with slower-than-expected adoption due to high pricing, presents challenges. In this scenario, let&rsquo;s see how California-based EV startups <strong>Rivian Automotive</strong> RIVN and <strong>Lucid Group</strong> LCID are placed now.&nbsp; With RIVN reporting fourth-quarter 2024 results today and LCID next Tuesday, are either of these stocks worth buying ahead of their releases?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Q4 Expectations for RIVN</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RIVN&rsquo;s loss per share in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 66 cents, narrower than $1.36 incurred in the year-ago period. The loss estimate has also narrowed by a cent over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for revenues is $1.43 billion, implying an uptick of 8.5% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Rivian in the quarter-to-be-reported. The combination of a positive&nbsp;Earnings ESP&nbsp;and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That&rsquo;s the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our&nbsp;Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">RIVN has an Earnings ESP of +3.54% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rivian&rsquo;s fourth-quarter deliveries of 14,183 units surpassed Wall Street estimates and also rose from 3,972 units in the fourth quarter of 2023.&nbsp;Higher deliveries are expected to boost revenues. Rivian&rsquo;s efforts to improve its cost structure through manufacturing adjustments also bode well. Encouragingly, the company expects to achieve a modest positive gross margin in the quarter to be reported.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the trailing four quarters, Rivian missed EPS estimates thrice and beat on the other, with the average negative earnings surprise being 7.47%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Rivian Automotive, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Rivian Automotive, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/e6/1740049644.png" style="width: 600px; height: 293px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Rivian Automotive, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Rivian Automotive, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2>Q4 Expectations for LCID</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LCID&rsquo;s loss per share in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 26 cents, narrower than 29 cents incurred in the year-ago period. The loss estimate has remained unchanged over the past 90 days. The consensus mark for revenues is $225.5 million, implying an uptick of 43.4% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model doesn&rsquo;t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Lucid in the quarter to be reported. LCID has an Earnings ESP of +3.85% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lucid sold a record 3,099 vehicles in the December quarter, up 79% on a yearly basis and 11.4% on a sequential basis, which is likely to have driven revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. However, the company&rsquo;s research and development costs and its selling, general and administrative expenses are likely to have increased, thus putting pressure on the bottom line.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the trailing four quarters, Lucid missed EPS estimates on all occasions, with the average negative earnings surprise being 14.78%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Lucid Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Lucid Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/42/1740049720.png" style="width: 600px; height: 296px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Lucid Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Lucid Group, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2>Performance &amp; Valuation Comparison</h2><p>While both stocks underperformed the sector and the S&amp;P 500, Rivian shares have risen 6.5% in the past six months, while Lucid lost 6%.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">6-Month Price Performance Comparison</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/50/94563.jpg?v=1827816058" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">At their current levels, Rivian trades at 2.65X forward sales, which is a pleasant discount to Lucid&rsquo;s 6.5X, although both are at premiums to the auto sector&rsquo;s 1.48X.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a2/94414.jpg?v=702013769" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How to Play RIVN &amp; LCID Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Rivian has overcome last year&rsquo;s production and supply chain hurdles. With component shortages largely resolved, the company is deepening its focus on cost efficiencies, which should help improve the bottom line. Notably, material costs for its R1 lineup are expected to drop by 20% in 2025, while the upcoming R2 models could see a 45% cost reduction. Rivian&rsquo;s partnership with <strong>Volkswagen</strong> VWAGY is another strong catalyst, alongside the expansion of its product lineup with the R2, R3, and R3X models. However, like many EV startups, Rivian continues to burn cash, which remains a concern.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lucid, on the other hand, is betting big on its upcoming Gravity model. It benefits from strong financial backing, with Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) injecting $8.9 billion since 2018. However, these capital raises come at the cost of significant shareholder dilution, posing a key risk. While Lucid has taken steps to control costs, its high cash burn necessitates continued external funding, making its financial stability a major concern.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From a valuation perspective, Rivian holds the upper hand and has a better near-term outlook. Overall, it appears to be in a stronger position with a clearer path to cost reduction and profitability. Investors will be watching whether the company manages to meet its target of achieving gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024. For now, existing shareholders should hold Rivian, while potential investors may want to wait for more clarity on execution. In contrast, Lucid&#39;s financial struggles and ongoing dilution make it a riskier bet. Until there is clearer improvement in fundamentals, Lucid stock is best avoided.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418333/rivn-or-lcid-which-stock-is-better-positioned-pre-q4-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2418333">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Will Increasing Uptake of Ciena's WaveLogic 6 Extreme Buoy its Shares? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:38:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ciena Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s CIEN WaveLogic 6 Extreme (WL6e) &mdash; the industry&rsquo;s first 1.6 Tb/s coherent optical technology &mdash; is set to be deployed by Cirion Technologies to enhance its digital infrastructure and meet the evolving demands of modern connectivity. The transformation is likely to boost Cirion&rsquo;s terrestrial and submarine networks across Latin America and is expected to be the continent&rsquo;s first 1.6 Tb/s single carrier wavelength deployment.<br /><br />With over 160 interconnected data centers spanning more than 60 cities across Latin America, Cirion will utilize Ciena&rsquo;s WL6e technology to enhance connectivity between key data centers in the region, ensuring high-capacity and low-latency performance. This advancement is crucial for supporting bandwidth-intensive applications such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT) and streaming services.<br /><br />Cirion&rsquo;s decision to implement WL6e comes after the successful deployment of WaveLogic 5, which significantly improved network performance. With Ciena&rsquo;s WL6e, Cirion is poised to optimize network efficiency, sustainability and scalability, essential for supporting the rapid adoption of cloud services, AI and other emerging technologies.<br /><br />Moreover, Cirion is upgrading the SAC East submarine cable, which connects St. Croix (U.S. Virgin Islands) to Brazil, by increasing channel speed to 1.2 Tb/s with WL6e. It is also set to implement Ciena&rsquo;s GeoMesh Extreme combined with the 6500 optical platform and RLS Submarine Line Terminating Equipment on its new SAC-2 submarine route, part of the Firmina subsea system. Spanning 14,517 km, this cable system will link the United States, Brazil and Argentina, solidifying Latin America&rsquo;s global digital connectivity.&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Ciena Corporation Price and Consensus</h3> <img alt="Ciena Corporation Price and Consensus" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/de/1740049382.png" title="" width="568" /> <p>Ciena Corporation price-consensus-chart | Ciena Corporation Quote</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Powered by WL6e, it will deliver 800Gb/s over 10,975 km and 1.2 Tb/s over 2,500 km for submarine cables. On terrestrial regions, WL6e will enable 1.6 Tb/s speeds for metro DCI and backhaul networks.<br /><br />Cirion&rsquo;s network upgrade also includes the deployment of Ciena&rsquo;s coherent aggregation routers &mdash; 8110, 8112 and 8114 &mdash; to enhance routing and aggregation capabilities. Also, Ciena&rsquo;s Navigator Network Control Suite, featuring Liquid Spectrum analytics, will offer advanced management and control, allowing Cirion to monitor, configure and optimize its multi-layer network for better performance and reliability.</p><h2>Rapid Adoption of CIEN&rsquo;s WLe6 Drives Top-Line Momentum</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s WaveLogic 6 Extreme is gaining steady traction. It has now become generally available, solidifying Ciena&rsquo;s position as the only provider of 1.6 terabit capable coherent modems in the market, further enhancing its technological leadership. Revenues from WaveLogic 6E were recognized in the fiscal fourth quarter, with shipments made to multiple customers, including Verizon, euNetworks and One New Zealand, who have also publicly announced their trials and deployments. Solid sales of Ciena&rsquo;s solutions are likely to fuel revenue growth and favor the stock movement.&nbsp;<br /><br />In January 2025, the WLe6 was deployed by Southern Cross Cable Limited to achieve a milestone of connecting the world&#39;s first transpacific 1 Tb/s single-carrier wavelength across its 13,500-kilometer live production network. It delivered seamless performance at 1 Tb/s over the longest single optical submarine cable segment globally. In November 2024, WLe6 was implemented by EuNetworks, a leading provider of critical bandwidth infrastructure, as Europe&rsquo;s first 1.6 Tb/s coherent solution.&nbsp;<br /><br />In October 2024, the solution was adopted by Boldyn Networks to enhance its fiber network in New York and New Jersey through a scalable wavelength service that delivers up to 1.6Tb/s per channel. Boldyn Networks integrates advanced coherent technology with a simplified, server-like operational model using Ciena&rsquo;s Waveserver platform, effectively reducing costs per bit and energy use. This offering will address customers&#39; current and future growth needs, supporting speeds of 100Gb/s, 400Gb/s, 800Gb/s and up to 1.6Tb/s.</p><h2>CIEN&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Stock Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">CIEN currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Shares of the company have soared 59.9% in the past year compared with the industry&#39;s growth of 64.1%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a7/94554.jpg?v=589641374" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Other Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other top-ranked stocks from the broader technology space are <strong>InterDigital, Inc. </strong>IDCC, <strong>Keysight Technologies, Inc.</strong> KEYS and <strong>Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company</strong> HPE. IDCC presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), whereas KEYS &amp; HPE carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />IDCC is a pioneer in advanced mobile technologies that enable wireless communications and capabilities. The company engages in designing and developing a wide range of advanced technology solutions, which are used in digital cellular as well as wireless 3G, 4G and IEEE 802-related products and networks. It has a long-term growth expectation of 15%.<br /><br />Keysight is expected to benefit from the growing proliferation of electronic content in vehicles, momentum in space and satellite applications and rising adoption of driver-assistance systems globally. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 5.10%.<br /><br />HPE&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 7.84%. In the last reported quarter, Hewlett Packard delivered an earnings surprise of 5.45%. The company&rsquo;s long-term earnings growth rate is 5.8%. Its shares have surged 45.6% in the past year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418326/will-increasing-uptake-of-ciena-s-wavelogic-6-extreme-buoy-its-shares?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_tech_sector-2418326">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Grab These 3 Small-Cap Value Mutual Funds for Excellent Returns ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Small-cap value mutual funds provide excellent choices for investors looking for bargains, i.e., stocks at a discount with impressive growth potential. Value mutual funds comprise stocks trading at a discount to book value, low price-to-earnings ratios and high dividend yields.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Value investing is a very popular strategy, and for a good reason. After all, who doesn&rsquo;t want to find stocks with low Price/Earnings (P/Es), solid outlooks and decent dividends? Added to that, small-cap funds are good choices for investors with a high-risk appetite, as companies with small market capitalizations are expected to have higher growth potential than large- and mid-cap companies. Small-cap funds generally invest in companies having a market cap lower than $2 billion.

<![CDATA[ DOW Stock Loses 27% in 6 Months: What Should Investors Do? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dow Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s DOW shares have lost 26.5% in the past six months, underperforming the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry&rsquo;s decline of 4.4%. The bearishness reflects headwinds from soft end-market demand amid an unfavorable macroeconomic environment and pricing pressure, which have weighed heavily on the stock.&nbsp;<br /><br />Technical indicators show that DOW has been trading below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) since Oct. 7, 2024. The stock is also currently trading below the 50-day SMA. Following a death crossover on July 29, 2024, the 50-day SMA continues to read lower than the 200-day SMA, indicating a bearish trend.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Dow&rsquo;s Shares Trades Below 50-Day SMA</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9c/94542.jpg?v=986144811" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the significant pullback in Dow&rsquo;s shares, investors might be tempted to snap up the stock. But is this the right time to buy DOW? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Soft Demand, Pricing &amp; Cost Headwinds Take Toll on DOW Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">DOW faces challenges from demand softness in Europe and China. Lower consumer spending amid inflationary pressures is affecting demand in Europe. Construction and manufacturing activities remain soft in the region. Demand in Asia has been affected by weaker demand recovery in China. The property sector remains sluggish in China with declining new home prices.<br /><br />Demand in infrastructure including residential construction, remains weak. Inflationary pressures are hurting consumer durables and building and construction demand. Demand in infrastructure including residential construction, also remains weak. Dow sees softness in automotive in Europe due to low demand. Soft conditions across these markets are likely to weigh on volumes in the near term.&nbsp; Demand is expected to remain pressured by elevated inflation, low consumer confidence in Europe, and geopolitical tensions, particularly in building and construction, and durable goods markets. Dow expects weak macroeconomic conditions to continue across most end markets and regions over the near term.<br /><br />Dow is also being challenged by weak siloxane prices in its Performance Materials &amp; Coatings unit. The segment continues to see siloxane pricing pressure partly due to supply additions in Asia. Siloxane prices remain under pressure due to competitive pricing pressure resulting from additional supply driven by capacity additions in China. While capacity additions have slowed lately, elevated industry supply is expected to continue to impact prices over the near term.<br /><br />The company faces headwinds from higher feedstock and energy costs. Severe cold weather has contributed to an uptick in feedstock prices. Dow expects a $100 million headwind in the first quarter of 2025 in the Packaging &amp; Specialty Plastics segment due to higher feedstocks and energy costs and lower global integrated margins. It also sees consolidated earnings to decline by $200 million in the first quarter from the prior quarter factoring in higher expected feedstock costs.&emsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">High-Return Growth Projects &amp; Cost Actions Aid Dow</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">DOW benefits from its differentiated portfolio and low-cost feedstock positions. It remains focused on investing in attractive areas through highly accretive projects. Disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities also support its Decarbonize and Grow strategy to deliver long-term value creation for its shareholders. DOW is advancing its Decarbonize and Grow, and Transform the Waste strategies, which are expected to deliver more than $3 billion in underlying earnings annually by 2030.<br /><br />The company received a definitive green light from its board in November 2023 for its Fort Saskatchewan Path2Zero initiative, marking a significant milestone in its commitment to building the world&#39;s inaugural net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions-integrated ethylene cracker and derivatives facility in Alberta, Canada.<br /><br />The project involves the construction of a new ethylene cracker, a 2-million MTA polyethylene capacity expansion and retrofitting the existing cracker to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions. It is expected to generate $1 billion in EBITDA growth annually throughout the economic cycle and decarbonize 20% of Dow&#39;s global ethylene capacity. The investment positions DOW to meet increasing demand in lucrative markets such as packaging, infrastructure and hygiene, with additional potential gains from the commercialization of low and zero-emission products. Dow has inked a long-term agreement with Linde for the supply of clean hydrogen at the Path2Zero project.<br /><br />Dow also focuses on maintaining cost and operational discipline. It is taking action to cut costs by $1 billion to drive margins. The company expects to achieve the majority of the cost savings through a $500-$700 million reduction in direct costs and reduced labor costs, including a workforce reduction of around 1,500 roles globally. Dow is also reducing 2025 capital spending plans by $300-$500 million. The move is in response to the ongoing macroeconomic challenges and to support its long-term growth targets. Dow sees around $300 million in benefits from these actions in 2025 with full benefits expected by 2026.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">DOW&rsquo;s Solid Financial Health Supports Capital Allocation&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">DOW has a strong balance sheet and generates substantial cash flows, which allow it to finance its growth investments focused on higher-value businesses and regions and drive shareholder value. It generated cash from operating activities from continuing operations of $811 million in the fourth quarter and roughly $2.9 billion in 2024. It ended 2024 with solid liquidity of around $12 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of roughly $2.2 billion. DOW returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2024, comprising $2 billion in dividends and $0.5 billion in share buybacks.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dow, in December 2024, reached a definitive deal to sell a 40% equity interest in select U.S. Gulf Coast infrastructure assets to a fund managed by Macquarie Asset Management. DOW anticipates getting about $2.4 billion in initial cash proceeds from the sale of its 40% minority equity interest, with the potential to generate cash proceeds of up to roughly $3 billion for a 49% minority stake. Macquarie Asset Management will have the option to increase its ownership stake to 49% within six months of the transaction&#39;s closure. The deal increases financial flexibility and allows for continuous cash deployment into the most attractive initiatives that will generate long-term value for its shareholders.<br /><br />DOW offers a healthy dividend yield of 7.1% at the current stock price. While DOW has a high payout ratio of 164%, its dividend is perceived to be safe and reliable, backed by strong cash flows and sound financial health.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Dow&rsquo;s Earnings Estimates Moving Down</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DOW&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has been going down over the past 60 days. The consensus estimate for first-quarter 2025 earnings has also been revised downward over the same time frame.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1e/94543.jpg?v=80755994" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">DOW Trades at a Modest Discount</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">DOW is currently trading at a forward P/E of 17.23X, higher than its five-year median. It represents a roughly 1.1% discount when stacked up with the industry average of 17.43X.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/e6/94541.jpg?v=1035281981" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">DOW Stock Underperforms Industry &amp; S&amp;P 500&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">DOW&rsquo;s price performance has been lackluster, reflecting headwinds from soft end-market demand amid an unfavorable macroeconomic environment and pricing pressure. Its shares have tumbled 30.2% over the past year, underperforming the industry&rsquo;s 1% decline and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s increase of 24.1%. Its peers, <strong>LyondellBasell Industries N.V.</strong> LYB and <strong>BASF SE </strong>BASFY have lost 20.4% and 0.6%, respectively, while <strong>Eastman Chemical Company</strong> EMN has gained 18.2%, over the same period.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">DOW&rsquo;s One-year Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7e/94540.jpg?v=706634153" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>How Should Investors Play the DOW Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">While DOW benefits from its cost and productivity actions and investment in high-return projects, it is exposed to weak demand in a challenging environment as well as pricing and cost headwinds, which have led to its underperformance. This, coupled with declining earnings estimates cast a pall on the company&#39;s prospects. It is not advisable to buy the dip in this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock until market conditions improve.<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418281/dow-stock-loses-27-in-6-months-what-should-investors-do?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2418281">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas Corporation</strong> MGY reported a&nbsp;fourth-quarter 2024 net profit of 49 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. This outperformance can be attributed to a healthy increase in production volumes. However, the bottom line decreased from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s 50 cents, due to a 9.8% increase in operating expenses year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks </em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The oil and gas exploration and production company&rsquo;s total revenues were $326.6 million, which marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $326 million. The top line increased 1.2% from $322.6 million recorded in the year-ago period due to higher-than-expected revenues from natural gas liquids. The total natural gas liquids revenues reached $52 million, surpassing the consensus estimate of $45.5 million.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas Corp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/36/1740043037.png" title="" width="568" /> <p>Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas Corp price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas Corp Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">In the quarter under review, the company recorded $222.6 million in net cash from operating activities and achieved a free cash flow of $90.3 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On Feb. 3, South Texas-focused Magnolia declared a cash dividend of 15 cents per share of Class A Common stock and a cash distribution of 15 cents of Class B unit, payable on March 3, to its shareholders of record as of Feb. 14. The quarterly dividend indicates a 15.4% increase, resulting in an annualized dividend rate of 60 cents per share. This marks the fourth consecutive year MGY has raised its dividend since initiating payments in 2021. The company&rsquo;s continued focus on reducing outstanding shares and achieving steady annual production growth contributes to robust dividend increase.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 2.2 million Class A Common shares for $55.8 million. For the full year of 2024, the company repurchased a total of 11 million shares, consisting of 7.5 million Class A Common shares and 3.5 million Class B shares, resulting in a 5% reduction in its diluted weighted average share count compared with the previous year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, MGY&rsquo;s board of directors approved an increase in the existing share repurchase authorization by 10 million shares, bringing the total remaining authorization to 11.7 million Class A Common shares, designated specifically for open market share repurchases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Magnolia returned 90% of its free cash flow to shareholders in the fourth quarter and 88% for the full year 2024, through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.</p><h2>MGY&rsquo;s Production &amp; Prices</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The average daily total output of 93,096 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) increased from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s 85,414 boe/d. However, the figure slightly beat our estimate of 93,000 boe/d. Oil and gas production increased 9% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Oil volumes totaled 38,821 barrels per day (bpd), up 9.5% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level. Moreover, the figure exceeded our estimate of 38,500 bpd. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Natural gas volumes reached 167,079 thousand cubic feet per day (Mcf/d), up 7.9% from the fourth quarter of 2023. However, the figure missed our expectations of 175,900 Mcf/d.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The average realized crude oil price was $69.01 per barrel, indicating a 12.1% decrease from the year-ago period&rsquo;s $77.39. &nbsp;The figure also missed our expectations of $71.87 per barrel.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The average realized natural gas liquids price was $21.27 per barrel, implying an 8% decrease from the year-ago period&rsquo;s figure. On the other end, natural gas prices were in line with the prior-year figure of $1.85 per Mcf. MGY recorded an average sales price of $38.13 per boe compared with $41.06 a year ago.</p><h2><strong>MGY&rsquo;s Balance Sheet &amp; Capital Expenditure</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, Magnolia had cash and cash equivalents of $260 million and long-term debt of $392.5 million. The total debt-to-total capital was 16.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company spent $131.6 million on its capital program in the reported quarter. Operating expenses increased to $202.5 million from $184.5 million in the year-ago period.</p><h2>MGY&rsquo;s Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Magnolia expects 2025 drilling and completion (D&amp;C) capital spending to be between $460 million and $490 million. Non-operated capital is also expected to be in line with 2024 levels. Production growth is expected to be 5-7% for the year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The capital spending program is anticipated to result in total production growth of 5-7% for 2025. In the first quarter of 2025, D&amp;C capital spending is estimated to be around $135 million. Total production for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 94 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Oil price differentials are expected to be about a $3 per barrel discount to Magellan East Houston and MGY remains unhedged for all oil and natural gas production. The fully diluted share count for the first quarter of 2025 is expected to be about 195 million shares, 5% lower than the first quarter of 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MGY currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). &nbsp;You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><h2>Important Earnings at a Glance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">While we have discussed MGY&rsquo;s fourth-quarter results in detail, let us take a look at three other key reports of this space.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Oil and gas equipment and services provider <strong>Liberty Energy</strong> LBRT reported a fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted net income of 10 cents per share, which marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents, due to a year-over-year decrease in costs and expenses.&nbsp; However, the bottom line underperformed the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure of 54 cents, due to poor equipment and service execution, along with lower activity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, Liberty had approximately $20 million in cash and cash equivalents. The pressure pumper&rsquo;s long-term debt of $190.5 million represented a debt-to-capitalization of 8.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another oil and gas equipment and services provider <strong>Halliburton Company</strong> HAL posted a fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted net income per share of 70 cents, same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate but below the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s profit of 86 cents (adjusted). The numbers indicated softer activity in the region of North America, partly offset by improved fluid work in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><div><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, the company had approximately $2.6 billion in cash/cash equivalents and $7.2 billion in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 40.4. The company generated $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter, leading to a free cash flow of $1.1 billion.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Energy infrastructure provider <strong>Kinder Morgan</strong> KMI reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 32 cents, shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 33 cents. The lower-than-expected quarterly earnings were primarily due to decreased volumes on certain systems, asset divestitures and lower crude, CO2 and NGL volumes. KMI&rsquo;s fourth-quarter DCF was $1.3 billion, up from $1.2 billion a year ago.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, Kinder Morgan reported $88 million in cash and cash equivalents. Its long-term debt amounted to $29.8 billion at the quarter-end. For 2025, Kinder Morgan anticipates a net income of $2.8 billion, up 8% from the prior-year level, and an adjusted EPS of $1.27, up 10%. The company expects to declare dividends of $1.17 per share, up 2% from the prior-year figure. It also anticipates budgeted adjusted EBITDA of $8.3 billion, up 4% from the previous-year level.</p></div><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418273/magnolia-q4-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates-dividend-raised?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418273">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Diamondback Enters Into an Agreement to Expand Midland Basin Footprint ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Diamondback Energy, Inc.&nbsp;</strong>FANG has secured key Midland Basin assets from Double Eagle IV Midco, LLC in a cash and stock deal. The deal enhances the company&rsquo;s core holdings and positions it for long-term free cash flow growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Diamondback has also agreed with Double Eagle to accelerate development at one of its non-core southern&nbsp;Midland Basin assets. This acceleration will enhance the net asset value of Diamondback&rsquo;s lower-quality acreage faster and help grow its free cash flow in 2026 and beyond with minimum capital deployment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This deal, which is expected to close pending regulatory approvals by April 1, 2025, marks a significant step in Diamondback&rsquo;s strategy to consolidate its leadership in the most prolific Permian Basin.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Consideration for FANG&rsquo;s Purchase Agreement</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The consideration for the deal will be paid in both cash and stock. The approximate value of the contract is $4 billion, and Diamondback will pay $3 billion in cash and about 6.9 million shares of its common stock in exchange for the same.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The cash portion of the transaction will be paid through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under a credit facility and proceeds from term loans and senior notes offerings.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">FANG&rsquo;s Strategic Expansion and Value Creation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The acquisition covers approximately 40,000 net acres in the Midland Basin, a region known for its high-quality oil reserves. With 68% of the undeveloped acreage and 407 new locations in development target, this deal significantly extends Diamondback&rsquo;s high-quality inventory. This deal will also help Diamondback achieve the estimated run-rate production of about 27 MBo/d (Thousand Barrels of Oil per Day).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the completion of this agreement, Diamondback would be solidifying its position to have the longest duration of high-quality inventory with a low breakeven.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Will This Deal Impact FANG&rsquo;s Balance Sheet?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A portion of the consideration of this deal will be financed through borrowings and loans, which can impact Diamondback&rsquo;s balance sheet. Therefore, in order to maintain financial discipline, the company has committed to selling at least $1.5 billion of its non-core assets, ensuring that the acquisition does not overly strain its balance sheet. After the sale, the company expects to reduce net debt to $10 billion and maintain long-term leverage between $6 and $8 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">FANG&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Texas-headquartered Diamondback Energy is an independent oil and gas exploration &amp; production company.&nbsp;Currently, FANG has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the energy&nbsp;sector might look at some top-ranked stocks like <strong>SM Energy Company&nbsp;</strong>SM, <strong>Prairie Operating Co. </strong>PROP and&nbsp;<strong>Gulfport Energy Corporation&nbsp;</strong>GPOR.While SM Energy and PROP currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, Gulfport Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Denver, CO-based SM Energy Company is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, exploitation, development, acquisition and production of natural gas and crude oil in North America. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SM&rsquo;s 2024 earnings indicates 15.11% year-over-year growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Houston-based Prairie Operating is an independent energy company engaged in the development and acquisition of proven, producing oil and natural gas resources principally in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PROP&rsquo;s 2024 earnings indicates 81.19% year-over-year growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Gulfport Energy is an independent natural gas and oil company focused on the exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties in North America. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPOR&rsquo;s 2024 earnings indicates 108.53% year-over-year growth.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418268/diamondback-enters-into-an-agreement-to-expand-midland-basin-footprint?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_energy_sector-2418268">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 20, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms, Inc. META, BlackRock, Inc. BLK, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW, Seneca Foods Corp. SENEA and Crown Crafts, Inc. CRWS.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Here are highlights from Wednesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Top Research Reports for Meta Platforms, BlackRock and Palo Alto Networks</em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today&#39;s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc., BlackRock, Inc. and Palo Alto Networks, Inc., as well as two micro-cap stocks, Seneca Foods Corp. and Crown Crafts, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can <strong>see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><u>Ahead of Wall Street</u></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The daily &#39;Ahead of Wall Street&#39; article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day&#39;s trading action. The article comes out before the market&#39;s open and attempts to make sense of that morning&#39;s economic releases and how they will affect that day&#39;s market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can read today&#39;s AWS here &gt;&gt;&gt; <strong>Housing Puts Up Mixed Numbers; Earnings for ETSY, GRMN &amp; More </strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Today&#39;s Featured Research Reports</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Meta Platforms&rsquo;</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+51.7% vs. +33.7%). The Zacks analyst believes that steady user growth across all regions and increased engagement for its products have been major growth drivers for Meta. The company&rsquo;s growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BlackRock&rsquo;</strong>s shares have underperformed the Zacks Financial &ndash; Investment Management industry over the past six months (+13.6% vs. +19.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that higher expenses, owing to higher general and administration costs, are expected to hurt profits. BlackRock&rsquo;s reliance on overseas revenues exposes it to geopolitical tensions, different regulatory/economic environments and exchange rate fluctuation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Yet planned acquisitions of Preqin and HPS Investment, along with the buyouts of Global Infrastructure Partners and a 75% stake in SpiderRock, have boosted revenues. Efforts to expand into alternatives and private equity, as well as its solid assets under management (AUM) balance, have also aided the firm.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(You can read the full research report on BlackRock here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of<strong> Palo Alto</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Security industry over the past two years (+146.1% vs. +122.6%). Per the Zacks analyst, the company has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-gen security platforms. Product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy have also aided.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds may hurt its near-term prospects. Forex headwinds and higher marketing and sales expenses are likely to continue hurting its profitability..</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(You can read the full research report on Palo Alto here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Seneca Foods&rsquo; </strong>shares have outperformed the Zacks Food &ndash; Miscellaneous industry over the last six months (+32.7% vs. -11.7%). The Zacks analyst believes that strategic inventory reductions and improved cash flow highlight financial discipline, while its diversified product mix, including brands like Libby&rsquo;s and Green Giant, supports market leadership in packaged fruits and vegetables.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, rising costs from weather impacts, higher LIFO charges, increased interest expenses, competitive pressures, raw material volatility and customer concentration underscore challenges in sustaining growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(You can read the full research report on Seneca Foods here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Crown Crafts&rsquo; </strong>shares have outperformed the Zacks Textile &ndash; Home Furnishing industry over the past six months (-8.0% vs. -13.0%). The Zacks analyst believes that the acquisition of Baby Boom Consumer Products in July 2024 has proven immensely profitable for the company. Improved gross margin, manageable debt structure and a strategic initiative to consolidate warehouse operations have also aided.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, heavy customer concentration poses revenue risks while rising inventory levels and macroeconomic sensitivity expose liquidity pressures. Reliance on China for sourcing increases tariff and supply chain risks. Weak legacy sales signal challenges, despite expanding retail channels and strong licensing opportunities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(You can read the full research report on Crown Crafts here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+48.4%, +50.2%</strong> and <strong>+56.7%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">support@zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

<![CDATA[ Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Live Nation, TKO Group and News ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 20, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Live Nation Entertainment LYV, TKO Group Holdings, Inc. TKO and News Corp. NWSA.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Industry: Film &amp; TV Production</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417700/3-film-television-production-stocks-to-buy-on-solid-industry-trends</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is witnessing a surge in demand for digital entertainment due to operational constraints faced by movie theaters, theme parks and cruise lines. This increased consumption of online media, music and news, driven by the work-and-learn-from-home trend, has been a boon for industry players like <strong>Live Nation Entertainment</strong>, <strong>TKO Group Holdings, Inc.</strong> and <strong>News Corp.</strong> However, as more players enter the field, content costs are skyrocketing, putting pressure on profitability. This trend is forcing companies to spend heavily on original programming and exclusive rights to attract and retain viewers, which can strain financial resources and impact stock performance.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Description</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry encompasses companies engaged in the creation, distribution and exhibition of film and television content. The core activities revolve around producing entertainment for theaters, television networks, video-on-demand platforms, streaming services and other outlets that showcase such works. A notable company like Imax specializes in advanced motion picture technologies and immersive presentation experiences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Industry participants are involved in the production and dissemination of movies destined for theatrical releases and direct-to-video markets, as well as television programming. The financial performance of these entities hinges greatly on the global box office success of their films, coupled with the number of new releases and the viewership ratings garnered by their television shows.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">3 Film and Television Production Industry Trends in Focus</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Over-the-Top Services Gain Prominence</em></strong>: Content creators are increasingly distributing through over-the-top streaming services to capitalize on the popularity of their franchises. Their aim is to provide exclusive content and a differentiated viewing experience. However, streaming companies themselves are producing more original, award-winning programming to reduce licensing costs and reliance on third-party providers, which could undermine traditional content distribution strategies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Binge-Watching Drives Consumption</em></strong>: Phenomena like binge-watching, wider Internet adoption, and advancements in mobile, video and wireless technologies have led consumers to frequently view content on smaller screens. To adapt to these new viewing patterns, industry players are pivoting to digital content distribution. The rise of digital capabilities provides easier access to consumer data, allowing production companies to leverage AI tools for better understanding audience preferences and creating resonant content. However, intense competition from streamers is forcing increased spending on content and marketing, hurting profitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Technological Advancement Aids Prospects</em></strong>: Exhibitors are adopting highly efficient, cost-effective laser projection systems to enhance image quality and the overall movie experience. Technologies like motion seating, immersive audio, interactive movies, AR and VR are expected to further elevate the viewing experience. Conversely, the growth of alternative distribution channels like home video, pay-per-view, streaming, VOD, Internet and broadcast TV is challenging traditional exhibitors.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #32, which places it in the top 13% of more than 246 Zacks industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The industry&rsquo;s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let&rsquo;s take a look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Outperforms the Sector, S&amp;P 500</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The industry has returned 42.7% in the above-mentioned period compared with the broader sector&rsquo;s growth of 19.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has risen 24% during the same time frame.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry&#39;s Current Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">On the basis of the trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S), a commonly used multiple for valuing Film and Television Production and Distribution stocks, the industry is currently trading at 2.36X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 6.02X and the sector&rsquo;s 2.4X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.53X and as low as 0.6X, recording a median of 1.62X.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">3 Film &amp; Television Stocks to Buy Right Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Live Nation Entertainment</strong>: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company continues to demonstrate robust growth fundamentals across its ecosystem, making it an attractive buy opportunity for 2025. Following record concert profitability in 2024 with third-quarter AOI reaching $474 million (up 39% year over year) and margins expanding to an impressive 7.2%, the company is well-positioned for continued growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Leading indicators are exceedingly positive with the 2025 large venue pipeline up double-digits versus 2024, including stadiums, arenas and amphitheaters. With more than 20 million tickets already sold for 2025 events (pacing up double-digits) and recent stadium shows delivering double-digit growth in gross revenues, Live Nation&#39;s core business is accelerating post-pandemic. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company is strategically expanding its venue footprint, planning to add or refurbish 14 venues through 2025, increasing capacity by eight million fans. Ticket demand remains robust with global ticket sales in September/October up 20% year over year, while sponsorship commitments are pacing up double-digits for 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Management demonstrated prudent capital management with $5.5B billion in cash equivalents and $1.7 billion in free cash as of third-quarter 2024. With strong pricing power evidenced by premium offerings (VIP ticket revenue up 20%+ at major festivals), Live Nation has positioned itself to capture significant value from the continued growth in experiential entertainment spending.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Live Nation Entertainment shares have gained 65.9% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has moved north by a penny to $2.45 per share over the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TKO Group Holdings</strong>: This Zacks Rank #2 company holds bright prospects in 2025 demonstrated by robust financial performance and strategic growth initiatives. In third-quarter 2024, the company reported $681.2 million in revenues (up 52% year over year) and adjusted EBITDA of $310 million (up 29%), prompting management to raise full-year guidance to the upper end of their $2.670-$2.745 billion revenue range.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company maintains strong cash generation with $457.4 million in cash and cash equivalents while demonstrating financial discipline through its Free Cash Flow Conversion target exceeding 40%. TKO&#39;s recently announced capital return program, including a $2 billion share repurchase plan and quarterly dividend program beginning March 2025, signals management&#39;s confidence and commitment to shareholder returns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Looking ahead, TKO is excellently positioned for sustained growth through its pending acquisition of Professional Bull Riders, On Location, and IMG in an all-equity transaction valued at $3.25 billion. This strategic expansion will enhance TKO&#39;s sports marketplace position, increase scale and accelerate shareholder returns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The combination of UFC and WWE continues to demonstrate synergistic benefits through cost reduction initiatives, evidenced by WWE&#39;s Adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 54% from 36% year over year. With strong brands reaching over one billion households globally and organizing more than 300 live events annually, TKO represents an attractive investment in the premium sports entertainment sector.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TKO&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has moved north by 1% to $3.15 per share over the past 30 days. TKO shares have surged 100.9% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>News Corp.</strong>: This Zacks Rank #2 company is a compelling investment opportunity in 2025, demonstrating robust financial performance and strategic execution. The company&rsquo;s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results showcase its strength with a 5% revenue increase to $2.24 billion, a remarkable 58% surge in net income from continuing operations to $306 million, and 20% growth in Total Segment EBITDA to $478 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company is successfully executing its digital transformation strategy, with its three core growth pillars &mdash; Digital Real Estate Services, Dow Jones, and Book Publishing &mdash; collectively expanding Segment EBITDA by 16%. The strategic sale of Foxtel to DAZN for A$3.4 billion (7x Foxtel&#39;s FY2024 EBITDA) strengthens the balance sheet while allowing management to focus on high-growth, high-margin businesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">News Corporation is exceptionally well-positioned in the evolving AI landscape, having secured valuable content partnerships with companies like OpenAI while vigorously protecting its intellectual property. With credit rating upgrades to investment grade from both S&amp;P Global and Moody&#39;s, the company maintains financial flexibility for both shareholder returns and strategic investments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Digital revenues now constitute 81% of Dow Jones revenues, while both REA Group and realtor.com demonstrate strong performance despite challenging housing markets. The company&#39;s diversified portfolio, deliberate simplification strategy, and increasing digital penetration make NWSA an attractive growth investment with significant upside potential through 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">News Corporation shares have gained 15.1% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings has moved north by 9.3% to 94 cents per share over the past 30 days.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 20, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Vistra Corp. VST, Exelon Corp. EXC, Entergy Corp. ETR and Ameren Corp. AEE.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Industry: Electric Utility</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417878/4-electric-power-stocks-to-consider-amid-industry-weaknesses</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Utility &ndash; Electric Power industry players generate and supply electricity to millions of customers across the United States. The utilities have been transitioning toward clean sources of fuel and focusing on carbon emissions reduction. The support from the government is aiding the industry&rsquo;s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid and transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly to customers affected by storms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vistra Corp</strong>., with its expanding clean power generation portfolio and customer base, renewable operations, and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio are <strong>Exelon Corp. </strong>, <strong>Entergy Corp. </strong>and <strong>Ameren Corp.</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">About the Electric Power Industry</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Utility &ndash; Electric Power industry involves the generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A major portion of utilities&rsquo; earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation, demand for the services provided by utilities remains steady, regardless of economic cycles. A very hot summer and cold winter season increases demand for electricity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals. The increasing usage of the Internet globally and an expected increase in artificial intelligence (AI) in the future will create a rise in demand for electricity. AI-based queries need substantially higher power than traditional Internet searches, music and photos. The declining interest rate is a tailwind for capital-intensive utilities.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">3 Electric Power Industry Trends in Focus</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Interest Rate Decline is a Tailwind</em></strong>: To maintain, upgrade and expand operations, utilities approach capital markets for loans. Multiple rate hikes by the Federal Reserve took the benchmark rate to the 5.25-5.50% range, adversely impacting utility operators. The U.S. Federal Reserve has finally lowered the benchmark rate, with three rate cuts lowering the existing rates by 100 basis points and bringing down rates to a range of 4.25-4.50%. Capital-intensive domestic-focused utilities will benefit from the Fed&rsquo;s decision to reduce interest rates. The drop in interest rates is a big positive for utility operators planning large investments in infrastructure upgrades.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Transition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power</em></strong>: The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 23% in 2024 to 25% in 2025 and touch 27% in 2026 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act should support and accelerate the utilities&rsquo; transition toward clean energy sources. It has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for the use of renewable sources. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Rising Demand and Price for Electricity</em></strong>: Per EIA, electricity supply volumes in the United States will increase by 2% in 2025 from the 2024 level and further increase by 1% in 2026. A major portion of the electricity will be generated from clean energy sources. The development of large data centers in the United States is also increasing the electricity demand. Data centers consumed 4.4% of the U.S. electricity generation in 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per the U.S. Department of Energy release, data centers will consume between 6.7% and 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028. EIA predicts the price of electricity to U.S. residential customers in 2025 to average 16.94 cents per kWh, about 2.7% higher than the 2024 level and increase further in 2026 by 3.4% from the 2025 levels. Rates are also predicted to increase for industrial and commercial customers. The increase in electricity prices in the near term should favor the utilities.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. The 59-stock Utility-Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #146, which places it in the bottom 41% of more than 249 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The industry&rsquo;s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before we present a few Utility - Electric Power stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let&rsquo;s take a look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock-market performance and current valuation.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Electric Power Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 but Beats Sector</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Utility Electric Power industry has lagged the Zacks S&amp;P 500 but outperformed its sector over the past 12 months. The industry has gained 21.6% compared with its sector&rsquo;s 15.7% rally. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has gained 24.2% in the same period.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Electric Power Industry Trading at a Discount</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">On the basis of EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) TTM, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Utility Electric Power companies, the industry is trading at 14.01X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 17.7X and the Utility sector&rsquo;s 14.19X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.28X and as low as 10.99X, with the median being 15.38X.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Electric Power Industry Stocks to Add for Better Returns</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Utilities is a mature sector, and all the stocks selected from the Zacks Utility Electric Power industry have a market capitalization of more than $20 billion. The stocks currently have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each and have long-term capital investment plans, so a rate decline will definitely help these utilities. All stocks have returned better than the industry in the past 12 months. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vistra Corp</strong>.: Irving, TX-based Vistra, together with its subsidiaries, operates as an integrated retail electricity and power generation company. The company&rsquo;s systematic capital investment plans and expanding customer base should further drive its performance. It expects to invest nearly $2.22 billion in 2025. Vistra&rsquo;s integrated business model provides it with a competitive advantage compared with its non-integrated competitors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">VST&rsquo;s long-term (term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is pegged at 23.05%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vistra&rsquo;s 2025 earnings per share has implied growth of 0.95% in the last 60 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Exelon Corp.</strong>: Chicago-based Exelon focuses on the transmission and distribution of electricity. EXC has plans to invest $38 billion in different projects in the 2025-2028 period. EXC&rsquo;s current dividend yield is 3.55%. Traditionally, demand for electricity is adversely impacted by weather fluctuation and lower usage by customers. To offset the loss of revenues due to lower customer usage, nearly 78% of Exelon&rsquo;s distribution revenues are decoupled. Decoupling insulates the top line from load fluctuations and leads to stable earnings,</p><p style="text-align: justify;">EXC&rsquo;s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 5.71%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Exelon&rsquo;s 2025 earnings per share indicates growth of 0.4% in the last 60 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Entergy Corp.</strong>: New Orleans, LA-based Entergy is primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power. It expects capital deployment of nearly $37 billion in different projects from 2025 to 2028. These investments will mainly help the company deliver energy efficiently, improve customers&rsquo; experiences and provide environmental and cost-efficiency benefits to its customers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ETR&rsquo;s long-term earnings growth is pegged at 8.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ETR&rsquo;s 2025 earnings is pegged at $4.29 per share, indicating growth of 1.4% in the last 60 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ameren Corp.:</strong> St. Louis, MO-based Ameren, incorporated in December 1997, is a utility company that generates and distributes electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale end markets in Missouri and Illinois. It expects capital deployment in excess of $26.3 billion in different projects from 2025 to 2029. Ameren&rsquo;s growth has been led by its systematic and consistent investments in growth projects and infrastructural upgrades.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AEE&rsquo;s long-term earnings growth is pegged at 6.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AEE&rsquo;s 2025 earnings is pegged at $4.93 per share, indicating growth of 0.2% in the last 90 days.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+48.4%, +50.2%</strong> and <strong>+56.7%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Media Contact</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">support@zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 20, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses HireQuest, Inc. HQI, Heidrick &amp; Struggles International, Inc. HSII and Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. CCRN.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Industry: Staffing</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417954/3-staffing-stocks-to-consider-despite-industry-challenges</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Staffing Firms industry is anticipated to attain its pre-pandemic levels gradually, allowing companies to pay regular dividends. The rising adoption of remote work and hybrid models, backed by top-notch technological advancements, will drive the demand for staffing agencies. <strong>HireQuest, Inc.</strong>, <strong>Heidrick &amp; Struggles International, Inc.</strong> and <strong>Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. </strong>are gaining from technological developments that improve efficiency.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Description</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Staffing industry is a diverse sector encompassing companies that offer a range of human resources and workforce solutions. These services cover various aspects of personnel management, including employment screening, recruitment services for both temporary and long-term job placements, retirement planning, human capital management, payroll administration, performance evaluation, organizational planning, and financial management.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some firms within this industry provide specialized services, such as staffing and risk consulting, professional staffing, and global business solutions tailored to the needs of small to medium-sized enterprises. They also offer organizational consulting services with a global reach, catering to a diverse client base, which includes domestic and international businesses across different sectors and industries.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&#39;s Shaping the Future of the Business Services Industry?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Stable Demand: </em></strong>The industry is mature. The consistency in demand for services despite the economic downturn in the manufacturing sector has been robust for some time now. Revenues, income and cash flows are anticipated to gradually recover to the pre-pandemic level, allowing most industry players to pay out stable dividends.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Rising Adoption of Remote Work &amp; Hybrid Models: </em></strong>A significant rise in remote work has been observed since the pandemic, and it has made staffing agencies focus on flexible staffing solutions, including hybrid and remote work models. These adaptations help meet the desires of clients and job seekers for a better work-life balance. Given the continued demand for remote work, staffing agencies are expected to prioritize and effectively meet evolving workplace preferences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Tech-Driven Staffing Solutions on the Boom: </em></strong>The staffing sector is using technology to optimize operations, increase efficiency and deliver services at their highest quality. The growing adoption of AI-driven tools and platforms makes attracting, evaluating and onboarding IT talents more effective.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The rising adoption of social media and Big Data is being witnessed as well. Video-conferencing platforms, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, facilitate remote communication, and cloud and blockchain technologies bolster HR data security. Such technological advancements ensure that the demand for staffing services continues.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Sluggish Near-Term Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Staffing Firms industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #198. This rank places it in the bottom 20% of 249 Zacks industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a continued outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let us look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock market performance and current valuation.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Lags Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Staffing Firms industry has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the broader sector over the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The industry has declined 17.4% against the S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s growth of 24.2% and the broader sector&rsquo;s rise of 29.5% in the same timeframe.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry&#39;s Current Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">On the basis of EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), which is commonly used for valuing staffing stocks because of their high debt levels, the industry is currently trading at 7.48X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 17.7X and the sector&rsquo;s 27.05X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 8.92X and as low as 7.28X, with the median being 7.95X.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">3 Staffing Stocks Poised for Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">We have presented three stocks that are expected to grow in the near term.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Heidrick &amp; Struggles:</strong> This provider of executive search, consulting and on-demand talent services to businesses and business leaders is benefiting from improving segmental performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">HSII&rsquo;s core Executive Search business is benefiting from strong performances in the Americas and the Asia Pacific regions. Increasing average contract values indicating longer duration projects, along with a rising number of extensions with higher values, are aiding the On-Demand Talent business.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 20, 2025 &ndash; Stocks in this week&rsquo;s article are Deckers Outdoor Corp. DECK, Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. BOOT, Addus HomeCare Corp. ADUS and The Ensign Group, Inc. ENSG.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Pick These 4 Stocks with Impressive Interest Coverage Ratios</em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">An ill-informed investor can lose cash if he wagers on a stock only based on the numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of a company&rsquo;s financial background is a must for a better investment decision, especially at a time when the stock market is juggling myriad issues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Often, investors evaluate a company&rsquo;s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company&rsquo;s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the coverage ratio comes into play &mdash; the higher the metric, the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Deckers Outdoor Corp.</strong>, <strong>Boot Barn Holdings, Inc.</strong>, <strong>Addus HomeCare Corp.</strong> and <strong>The Ensign Group, Inc.</strong> boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Interest Coverage Ratio?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay interest charges on its debt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. The company&rsquo;s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The interest coverage ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company&rsquo;s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are four of the 22 stocks that qualified the screening:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Deckers</strong>, a global leader in designing, marketing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel and accessories, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Deckers&rsquo; current financial year sales and earnings per share (EPS) suggests growth of 15.6% and 21.2%, respectively, from the year-ago period. DECK has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 36.8%, on average. The stock has risen 8.7% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Boot Barn Holdings</strong>, a leading lifestyle retailer of western and work-related footwear, apparel and accessories, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B. BOOT has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.2%, on average.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boot Barn Holdings&rsquo; current financial year sales and EPS indicates growth of 14.9% and 21.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period. BOOT has jumped 54.1% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Addus HomeCare</strong>, a provider of home care services, carries Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. ADUS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.3%, on average.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Addus HomeCare&rsquo;s current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 8.6% and 14.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period&rsquo;s levels. The stock has rallied 24% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ensign Group</strong>, a healthcare company that provides nursing, assisted living and other rehabilitation services, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. ENSG has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.5%, on average.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ensign Group&rsquo;s current financial year sales and EPS implies growth of 14.3% and 10.6%, respectively, from the year-ago period. The stock has risen 5.6% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 20, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Toll Brothers TOL.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Homebuilders Trade Lower After Toll Brothers Disappoints</em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The theme this earnings season has been one of expansion as more sectors experience year-over-year growth. Thus far, the percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks that are outperforming the index is on pace to exceed that of last year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last week was the third consecutive such stretch where we saw markets hit with a sizable morning gap down due to disruptive news. From tariffs and DeepSeek &ndash; to last week&rsquo;s hotter-than-expected inflation data &ndash; the market has faced several major headwinds. Its ability to absorb seemingly negative news and rebound in a strong manner speaks to the underlying demand for stocks in this environment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately for homebuilders, they&rsquo;ve been left in the dust.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Sticky Inflation Casts Doubt on Rate Path</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In general, homebuilders are feeling less optimistic about the housing market amid high costs and elevated mortgage rates. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index registered at 42 in February, a 5-point drop from January and the lowest level in 5 months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Inflation data from January showed part of the Fed&rsquo;s job &ndash; maintaining stable prices &ndash; remains quite difficult. The producer price index (PPI) showed wholesale prices rose 0.4% last month, more than the 0.3% projection. January&rsquo;s PPI rose 3.5% from a year ago.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the consumer end, headline CPI showed prices increased 3% over the prior year in January, an uptick from December&rsquo;s 2.9% annual gain. On a monthly basis, headline inflation rose 0.4%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Excluding food and energy, the &ldquo;core&rdquo; CPI displayed an annual increase of 3.3%, while the core measure rose 0.4% on a monthly basis. All figures were above forecasts and higher than those from December.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Notably, market participants pared back bets on interest rate cuts this year, pricing in just one cut following the data.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Toll Brothers Falls Short of Estimates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Toll Brothers</strong> appears to be the latest victim. Yesterday evening, the luxury homebuilder came out with fiscal first-quarter earnings of $1.75 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99/share by 12.06%. The bottom line plunged 22.2% from the year-ago period. Revenues of $1.86 billion also fell short of projections and decreased 4.6% year-over-year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The important metrics came in light primarily due to impairments and a delayed joint venture property sale. But management noted that affordability constraints and growing inventories are pressuring sales.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The fact that mortgage rates remain high is certainly taking a toll on signing activity in the housing market. A shortage of buildable lots and skilled labor is also limiting home production.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The recent miss was the second such event over the past four quarters. Toll Brothers, a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of -3.2%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TOL stock was down more than 8% early Wednesday morning before paring some of the losses.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Bottom Line</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite weakness from homebuilders, the results out of the Q4 earnings season speak to a resilient corporate backdrop. Total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up 13.3% from the same period last year on 5.5% higher revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nearly 400 companies are set to report quarterly results in the shortened trading week ahead, including more than 40 S&amp;P 500 companies. Be sure to stay abreast of the latest reports as the fourth-quarter earnings season continues to wind down.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+48.4%, +50.2%</strong> and <strong>+56.7%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Media Contact</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">support@zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 20, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Meta Platforms Inc. META and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Buy Meta Platforms Amid Solid Estimate Revisions</em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Global social media behemoth <strong>Meta Platforms Inc. </strong>is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly the Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">META&rsquo;s artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform is enhancing ad delivery efficiency and increasing return on ad spend for advertisers. Solid performance in spaces like e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and media is benefiting Meta Platforms.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strong Business Execution in Fourth-Quarter 2024</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">META has shown strong execution of its businesses as fourth-quarter 2024 earnings results handsomely beat both the top and bottom-line estimates. Family daily active people (DAP) was 3.35 billion versus the average estimate of 3.33 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP) came in at $14.25 compared to the average estimate of $13.85. Advertising revenues were $46.78 billion compared to the consensus estimate of $45.43 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year increase of 20.9%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Instagram has emerged as an important cash cow for META supported by generative AI. The growing popularity of Reels has been a driving force. The company is using AI to recommend roughly 40% of the content that users see on Instagram.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Messenger and WhatsApp are extremely prized possessions of Meta platforms. Ephemerality and end-to-end encryption have driven the popularity of WhatsApp. The rapid adoption of WhatsApp Business by small and mid-sized enterprises is noteworthy. Moreover, increased communication enhances chances of META penetrating the lucrative payments market.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Significant Leverage on Artificial Intelligence</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to effectively connect people through Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. The company is exploring chat experiences in WhatsApp and Messenger, visual creation tools for posts on Facebook and Instagram and ads. Gradually, META is expected to introduce AI for video and multi-modal experiences. Meta believes AI tools will improve business messaging experience and customer support.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On July 24, 2024, META unveiled its Llama 3 AI model. Using NVIDIA&rsquo;s latest HDX H200 chip that supports Meta Platforms&rsquo; Llama 3 AI model, an investment of $1 by an API provider can generate $7 in revenues over the next four years. This mostly free Llama 3 model and its advanced version to be released next year aim to compete with incumbents like Open AI.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">META said that currently 4 million advertisers are using the company&rsquo;s generative AI tools to create ads, up from 1 million six months ago. <strong>NVIDIA Corp.</strong>&rsquo;s next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell, is the upcoming driver. META to get B200 Blackwell chips. Meta Platforms saw higher retention rates among advertisers using generative AI-powered image expansion, and background and text generation tools.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">META is set to spend $60-$65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 compared with $50 billion expected earlier. According to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, &quot;Investing very heavily in capital expenditure and infrastructure is going to be a strategic advantage over time.&quot;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta Platforms is trying hard to ensure that its next-generation open AI platform Lalma 4 becomes the best platform in this space. Zuckerberg said &ldquo;Llama 4 will be natively multimodal &mdash; it&#39;s an omni-model &mdash; and it will have agentic capabilities, so it&#39;s going to be novel and it&rsquo;s going to unlock a lot of new use cases.&rdquo;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Solid Estimate Revisions for META Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For first-quarter 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently shows revenues of $41.44 billion, suggesting an improvement of 13.7% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) of $5.61, indicating an increase of 19.1% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2025 earnings has improved 4.1% over the last 30 days. META reported positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters with an average beat of 13.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year increase of 14.6% and 11.7%, respectively, for revenues and EPS in 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has improved 5.9% over the last 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Even after this upward revision, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 revenues and EPS reflects an upside of 13.3% and 13.2%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 earnings has improved 6% over the last 30 days.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Attractive Valuation of META Shares</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta Platforms currently carries the forward P/E of 27.63X for the current financial year, compared with 29.86X of the industry and 18.88X of the S&amp;P 500. META has a return on equity of 38.17% compared with -0.62% of the industry and 16.94% of the S&amp;P 500 Index. META currently has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 18.3%, well above the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s long-term EPS growth rate of 12.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At present, the short-term average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents an increase of 0.9% from the last closing price of $716.37. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $935-$505. This indicates a maximum upside of 30.5% and a maximum downside of 29.5%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">META Shares Flying High Year to Date</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta Platforms is witnessing an impressive rally in 2025 significantly outperforming other members of the &ldquo;magnificent 7&rdquo; group. Year to date, the stock price of META has jumped 22.2% compared with the 4.5% gain of the S&amp;P 500 and 3.9% of the Nasdaq Composite. The other six stocks have been underperforming these two indexes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta Platforms has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow, which makes it an attractive stock for investors.

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 20, 2025 &ndash; Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, &quot;Total earnings for the 403 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results are up +12.0% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues.&quot;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Retail Earnings: A Closer Look</em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Note: The following is an excerpt from this week&rsquo;s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Here are the key points:</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">With more than 80% of the earnings reports already in, we can safely say that it has been a good reporting cycle, with the growth pace showing a notable accelerating trend and companies comfortably beating consensus estimates.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Total earnings for the 403 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results are up +12.0% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 77.9% beating EPS estimates and 65.8% beating revenue estimates.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">The reporting focus is shifting to the Retail sector, where the brick-and-mortar operators are on deck to report results in the days ahead. However, more than half of the Zacks Retail sector companies have already reported Q4 results.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">For the 54.5% of Zacks Retail sector companies that have reported Q4 results already, primarily comprised of e-commerce operators and restaurant players, total earnings are up +45.9% from the same period last year on +8.5% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% beating revenue estimates. Excluding Amazon&rsquo;s results from the reported Retail sector numbers, the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates adjust down to -0.9% and +6.2%, respectively.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Retail Sector Earnings in Focus</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Q4 reporting focus shifts to the Retail sector in the days ahead as the brick-and-mortar operators start coming out with quarterly results.<strong>Walmart</strong> WMT will kick things off for the space, with the big question on investors&rsquo; minds being the stock&rsquo;s ability to sustain its impressive momentum. The stock is up +15.4% this year, handily outperforming the S&amp;P 500 index&rsquo;s +4.1% gain, <strong>Amazon&rsquo;s</strong> AMZN +3.1% gain, and<strong> Target&rsquo;s</strong> TGT -3.3% decline in that time period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Driving Walmart&rsquo;s stock market momentum has been the company&rsquo;s strong operating performance, reflecting the boost that the business is receiving from its e-commerce unit. The digital offering is allowing the company to offer a variety of convenient delivery and pick-up options, which, combined with Walmart&rsquo;s greater indexing to groceries and reputation for value, is helping it gain market share, particularly among higher-income households.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This seamless integration of Walmart&rsquo;s digital offering with its enormous brick-and-mortar footprint has enabled the company to offer a genuine competitive challenge to Amazon.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike Walmart, Target has a much smaller grocery exposure and indexes far more towards discretionary goods and products, the demand for which has been under pressure in the post-Covid period. While there are some other company-specific headwinds as well, the soft outlook for discretionary merchandise has been the primary reason for Target&rsquo;s underperformance.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Is The Tech Sector&rsquo;s Earnings Outlook Starting to Shift?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Tech sector has been a significant growth driver in recent quarters, and the trend is expected to continue in 2024 Q4 and beyond. For Q4, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +11.0% higher revenues, the 6<sup>th</sup> quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This would follow the sector&rsquo;s +22.7% earnings growth on +11% higher revenues in 2024 Q3.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Tech sector has also been among those few sectors that have steadily enjoyed an improving earnings outlook, with estimates steadily increasing. However, the more recent data on this count appears to show a shift in the revisions trend.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Earnings Big Picture</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Total S&amp;P 500 earnings for the current period (2025 Q1) are currently expected to be up +7.0% from the same period last year on +4.1% high revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The revisions trend is broad-based, with estimates for 15 of the 16 sectors down since the start of January (Medical is the only sector whose estimates have increased). Sectors suffering the most significant cuts to estimates include Conglomerates, Aerospace, Construction, Basic Materials, Autos, and others. Unlike other recent periods, estimates for the Tech sector have also been under pressure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expectation is for double-digit earnings growth in each of the next two years, with the number of sectors enjoying strong growth notably expanding from the narrow base we have been seeing lately.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, 2025 is expected to have nearly all Zacks sectors enjoy earnings growth, with 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to produce double-digit earnings growth. Unlike the last two years, when the Mag 7 group drove all or most of the aggregate earnings growth, we will have double-digit S&amp;P 500 earnings growth in 2025, even without the contribution from this mega-cap group.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+48.4%, +50.2%</strong> and <strong>+56.7%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Media Contact</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">support@zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 20, 2025 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Palomar Holdings PLMR as the Bull of the Day and Diageo DEO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA<strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Bull of the Day:</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In an investing world dominated by AI hype, unprofitable hyper-growth companies, and growing market uncertainty, it can be refreshing to buy stock in a simple, steadily growing business with a proven track record. <strong>Palomar Holdings</strong> is a specialty insurance provider that operates in a sector often overlooked by investors chasing the latest high-flying tech stocks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">No, insurance is not the most exciting or flashy industry, but it quietly boasts one of the most resilient and advantaged business models out there. With strong unit economics, predictable cash flows, and a product that remains essential regardless of market cycles, well-run insurers can be long-term wealth creators.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Palomar stands out with its top Zacks Rank, impressive growth forecasts, reasonable valuation, and strong price momentum, making it a compelling stock to consider in today&rsquo;s market.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Palomar&rsquo;s Impressive Sales and Earnings Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Palomar Holdings boasts exceptional business metrics that highlight its strong growth trajectory and powerful business model. The company is expected to deliver <strong>33.6% revenue growth this year</strong>, followed by another <strong>22.1% increase next year</strong>. On the bottom line, <strong>earnings are projected to climb 25% this year and another 18.3% next year</strong>, reflecting both operational efficiency and disciplined underwriting.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond its impressive top- and bottom-line growth, Palomar also benefits from expanding profitability, with net margins currently sitting at 21.1% and trending higher.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further solidifying its fundamental strength, analysts have been consistently raising earnings estimates for the past year, signaling increasing confidence in Palomar&rsquo;s business prospects. Over the last two months alone, estimates have risen across multiple timeframes, helping Palomar secure a coveted <strong>Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)</strong> rating. This sustained upward trend in earnings expectations suggests continued momentum and a favorable outlook for investors.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PLMR Stock Boast Strong Momentum</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to its impressive growth forecasts and solid business model, PLMR stock price action indicates higher prices may be imminent. After gapping significantly higher following its recent quarterly earnings report<strong>, the stock has been consolidating and forming a compelling bull flag</strong>. As the company continues to put up a truly impressive performance, it seems that more and more investors are accumulating shares, and I would not be surprised to see PLMR stock break higher in the near future.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Palomar Holdings Shares Trade at a Reasonable Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Palomar is currently trading at 22.9x forward earnings, which is below the industry average of 29.8x. The company is also growing faster than the average company in the industry and its stock price is considerably outperforming the industry and sector. These factors together make PLMR&rsquo;s valuation quite attractive.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Should Investors Buy Shares in PLMR?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Palomar Holdings presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong growth trajectory, robust business model, and favorable valuation, distinguishing itself in a market often focused on more volatile sectors. With impressive revenue and earnings growth forecasts, alongside a top Zacks Rank, PLMR is well-positioned for continued success, making it an attractive option for investors seeking stability and long-term wealth creation.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Bear of the Day:</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Diageo</strong>, the global spirits giant behind brands like Johnnie Walker, Guinness, and Tanqueray, has been struggling to keep up with the market. Compounding the challenges, Diageo&#39;s stagnant sales growth over the past three years raises serious concerns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the company has declining earnings estimates over the last year, indicating continued bearishness from analysts and giving it a <strong>Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) </strong>rating. DEO stock has significantly underperformed both its industry peers and the broader market, raising alarms about its near-term prospects.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Diageo Sales Stall and Earnings Estimates Fall</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Diageo&rsquo;s revenue growth has remained sluggish over the past few years, struggling to gain momentum. As shown in the revenue chart, sales have hovered within a narrow range, with no significant growth since 2021. This stagnation is concerning, particularly for a company that relies on premium branding and global expansion to drive revenue.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The weak top-line performance is now reflected in Diageo&rsquo;s earnings outlook. Analysts have unanimously lowered earnings expectations for both this year and next year. Estimates for this year decreased by 4.2% and 3.5% the next year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With falling earnings estimates and a stock price that continues to underperform, Diageo appears to be facing structural challenges that are likely to limit its upside potential in the near term.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Diageo Fights Demographic Shifts</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">One of the biggest headwinds facing Diageo is the changing drinking habits of younger consumers. Simply put, young people are drinking less than previous generations, posing a long-term challenge for alcohol producers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A 2023 Gallup survey highlights this shift, showing that the percentage of adults under 35 who say they drink alcohol has declined from 72% in 2001-2003 to just 62% in 2021-2023. This drop reflects broader lifestyle changes, with younger generations placing a higher emphasis on health and wellness, as well as a greater willingness to experiment with alcohol-free alternatives.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Should Investors Avoid DEO Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">With stagnant sales growth, declining earnings estimates, and shifting consumer trends working against it, Diageo faces significant challenges in the near term. The company&rsquo;s premium branding has historically been a strength, but younger consumers&rsquo; changing drinking habits and increased competition from non-alcoholic alternatives could weigh on long-term growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Until Diageo can reignite sales growth or show a reversal in earnings trends, investors may want to steer clear of DEO stock and look for stronger opportunities elsewhere.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Additional content:</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Should You Buy, Hold, or Sell SMCI Stock Before Filing Deadline? </em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Super Micro Computer, Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s shares have bounced back strongly this year after a weak performance last year. The recent business update has boosted momentum, with investors anticipating no hiccups in the company&rsquo;s highly-anticipated 10-K filing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Is now a good time to bet on the Supermicro stock, or should a wait-and-see approach be considered? Let&rsquo;s find out &ndash;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What Bothered SMCI Stock in 2024?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A plethora of discouraging news impacted the Supermicro stock last year. Supermicro was allegedly involved in accounting violations, per a short seller. The DOJ also investigated Supermicro for accounting irregularities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Supermicro received a non-compliance letter from the Nasdaq, raising the chances of being de-listed from the tech-heavy index. The situation worsened when Supermicro announced a delay in filing its annual 10-K report.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why is SMCI Stock Gaining This Year?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Things are looking brighter for Supermicro this year as management aims to publish last fiscal year&rsquo;s 10-K report before Feb. 25. Supermicro&rsquo;s previous auditor, Ernst &amp; Young, resigned due to management disputes. However, the company now works with reputed accounting firm BDO, ensuring timely SEC report filings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Supermicro&rsquo;s encouraging 2026 revenue growth estimates also boosted the stock price. Supermicro CEO Charles Liang expects revenues of $40 billion next year, way above the current consensus of $29.2 billion. The demand for Supermicro&rsquo;s direct-liquid cooling technology is set to spike next year due to data centers&rsquo; heat issues and likely boost sales.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Supermicro stock has soared 83.5% year to date, breezing past the Computer- Storage Devices industry&rsquo;s gain of 17.3%. The Supermicro stock is now one of the top-performing stocks on the S&amp;P 500, with its shares trading above the 50-day short-term moving average, indicating an imminent uptrend.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How to Trade SMCI Stock Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Considering the robust revenue growth and the expected prompt 10-K filings, it is advisable to hold Supermicro stock for gains in the long run. And why not? Supermicro&rsquo;s synergy with <strong>NVIDIA Corp.</strong> through the Blackwell platform has boosted its artificial intelligence (AI) computing power, trimmed operational expenses, and strengthened its market position.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Supermicro also uses energy-efficient technologies in operations, a boon once global environmental regulations tighten. Moreover, Supermicro&rsquo;s return on equity of 34% is higher than the industry&rsquo;s 23%, signifying strong profitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time, the Supermicro stock remains reasonably priced. This is because, per the price/earnings ratio, SMCI trades at 20.3X forward earnings. In comparison, the industry&rsquo;s forward earnings multiple is 22.05.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, skeptics doubting Supermicro&rsquo;s growth story may prefer to wait until Feb. 25 for a better financial insight before betting on the SMCI stock. For now, SMCI stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+48.4%, +50.2%</strong> and <strong>+56.7%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Media Contact</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

On the bottom line, <strong>earnings are projected to climb 25% this year and another 18.3% next year</strong>, reflecting both operational efficiency and disciplined underwriting.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Beyond its impressive top- and bottom-line growth, Palomar also benefits from expanding profitability, with net margins currently sitting at 21.1% and trending higher.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Further solidifying its fundamental strength, analysts have been consistently raising earnings estimates for the past year, signaling increasing confidence in Palomar&rsquo;s business prospects.

After gapping significantly higher following its recent quarterly earnings report<strong>, the stock has been consolidating and forming a compelling bull flag</strong>. As the company continues to put up a truly impressive performance, it seems that more and more investors are accumulating shares, and I would not be surprised to see PLMR stock break higher in the near future.</span></span></p><p><img alt="TradingView" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/62/94511.jpg?v=1703491982" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: TradingView</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Palomar Holdings Shares Trade at a Reasonable Valuation</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Palomar is currently trading at 22.9x forward earnings, which is below the industry average of 29.8x.

<![CDATA[ <iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VCJHWq-CtSc?rel=0" width="560"></iframe><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Diageo</strong> (</span></span>DEO<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">), the global spirits giant behind brands like Johnnie Walker, Guinness, and Tanqueray, has been struggling to keep up with the market. Compounding the challenges, Diageo&#39;s stagnant sales growth over the past three years raises serious concerns.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Additionally, the company has declining earnings estimates over the last year, indicating continued bearishness from analysts and giving it a <strong>Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) </strong>rating. DEO stock has significantly underperformed both its industry peers and the broader market, raising alarms about its near-term prospects.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/56/94506.jpg?v=1831996272" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Diageo Sales Stall and Earnings Estimates Fall</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Diageo&rsquo;s revenue growth has remained sluggish over the past few years, struggling to gain momentum. As shown in the revenue chart, sales have hovered within a narrow range, with no significant growth since 2021. This stagnation is concerning, particularly for a company that relies on premium branding and global expansion to drive revenue.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The weak top-line performance is now reflected in Diageo&rsquo;s earnings outlook. Analysts have unanimously lowered earnings expectations for both this year and next year. Estimates for this year decreased by 4.2% and 3.5% the next year.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">With falling earnings estimates and a stock price that continues to underperform, Diageo appears to be facing structural challenges that are likely to limit its upside potential in the near term.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/42/94507.jpg?v=1571065129" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Diageo Fights Demographic Shifts</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">One of the biggest headwinds facing Diageo is the changing drinking habits of younger consumers. Simply put, young people are drinking less than previous generations, posing a long-term challenge for alcohol producers.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">A 2023 Gallup survey highlights this shift, showing that the percentage of adults under 35 who say they drink alcohol has declined from 72% in 2001-2003 to just 62% in 2021-2023. This drop reflects broader lifestyle changes, with younger generations placing a higher emphasis on health and wellness, as well as a greater willingness to experiment with alcohol-free alternatives.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Should Investors Avoid DEO Stock?</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">With stagnant sales growth, declining earnings estimates, and shifting consumer trends working against it, Diageo faces significant challenges in the near term. The company&rsquo;s premium branding has historically been a strength, but younger consumers&rsquo; changing drinking habits and increased competition from non-alcoholic alternatives could weigh on long-term growth.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Until Diageo can reignite sales growth or show a reversal in earnings trends, investors may want to steer clear of DEO stock and look for stronger opportunities elsewhere.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2418065/bear-of-the-day-diageo-deo?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-bear_of_the_day-2418065">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 20, 2025 &ndash; Stocks in this week&rsquo;s article are Alcoa Corp AA, Noble Corp. Plc NE, Nextracker NXT, The Greenbrier Companies GBX and EZCORP EZPW.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>5 Low-Leverage Stocks to Buy Amid Weak Market Sentiment</em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The majority of U.S. equities indices finished barely in the green on Feb. 18, following President&rsquo;s Day. This reflected investors&rsquo; skepticism surrounding Trump&rsquo;s tariff policy and hardly any possibility of a Fed rate cut. Notably, President Trump indicated levying a 25% tariff on automobile, semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports yesterday. The general market consensus indicated that the Fed might not cut interest rates anytime soon to tackle inflation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In such a situation, an investor might not feel confident enough to invest in the stock market. However, a prudent investor knows that this is the right time to buy stocks that are safe bets. To this end, we recommend stocks like <strong>Alcoa Corp</strong>, <strong>Noble Corp. Plc</strong>, <strong>Nextracker</strong>, <strong>The Greenbrier Companies</strong> and <strong>EZCORP</strong>. These stocks bear low leverage and, therefore, should be a safer option for investors if they don&rsquo;t want to lose big in times of market turmoil.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let&rsquo;s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s the Significance of Low-Leverage Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to excessive debt financing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The equity market can be volatile at times, and, as an investor, if you don&rsquo;t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks that bear low leverage and are, hence, less risky.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears. The debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Analyzing Debt/Equity</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders&rsquo; Equity</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the fourth-quarter 2024 earnings season in its mid-way, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Alcoa Corp</strong>.: It is a global industry leader in bauxite, alumina and aluminum products. On Jan. 22, 2025, the company reported results for the fourth quarter of 2024. AA&rsquo;s adjusted earnings per share grew 82.5% year over year, while its fourth-quarter revenues improved 20%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AA&rsquo;s 2025 sales suggests a 13.2% improvement from 2024 actuals. The stock boasts a long-term (three-to-five years) earnings growth rate of 40.8%. It currently has a Zacks Rank #2.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Noble Corporation</strong>: It is an offshore drilling contractor in the oil and gas industry. On Feb. 17, 2025, the company released its fourth-quarter 2024 results. NE&rsquo;s adjusted net income grew 63% year over year, while its fourth-quarter revenues improved 44.2%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2025 sales suggests a year-over-year improvement of 18.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2025 earnings suggests a year-over-year improvement of 22%. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nextracker</strong>: It is a provider of intelligent, integrated solar tracker and software solutions used in utility-scale and distributed generation solar power plants. On Jan. 28, 2025, the company reported its third-quarter fiscal 2025 results. NXT registered a record backlog in the fiscal third quarter, which increased to more than $4.5 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 57.44%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2025 sales suggests a 14.2% improvement from the fiscal 2024 reported number. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Greenbrier Companies</strong>: It is a leading supplier of transportation equipment and services to the railroad and related industries. On Jan. 8, 2025, the company reported its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results. It reported net earnings of $55 million, or $1.72 per share, on revenues of $876 million and an operating margin of 12.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GBX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.7%. The stock boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 31.85%. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

On Feb. 5, 2025, the company announced its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results.

<![CDATA[ <div id="article_report"><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><em><strong>Note: The following is an excerpt from this week&rsquo;s Earnings Trends&nbsp;report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods,&nbsp;please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></em></span></p></div><p><strong>Here are the key points:</strong></p><ul><li><span style="font-size:16px;">With more than 80% of the earnings reports already in, we can safely say that it has been a good reporting cycle, with the growth pace showing a notable accelerating trend and companies comfortably beating consensus estimates.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style="font-size:16px;">Total earnings for the 403 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results are up +12.0% from the same period last year on +5.5% higher revenues, with 77.9% beating EPS estimates and 65.8% beating revenue estimates.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style="font-size:16px;">The reporting focus is shifting to the Retail sector, where the brick-and-mortar operators are on deck to report results in the days ahead. However, more than half of the Zacks Retail sector companies have already reported Q4 results.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style="font-size:16px;">For the 54.5% of Zacks Retail sector companies that have reported Q4 results already, primarily comprised of e-commerce operators and restaurant players, total earnings are up +45.9% from the same period last year on +8.5% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% beating revenue estimates. Excluding Amazon&rsquo;s results from the reported Retail sector numbers, the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates adjust down to -0.9% and +6.2%, respectively.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Retail Sector Earnings in Focus</strong></p><p>The Q4 reporting focus shifts to the Retail sector in the days ahead as the brick-and-mortar operators start coming out with quarterly results. Walmart WMT will kick things off for the space, with the big question on investors&rsquo; minds being the stock&rsquo;s ability to sustain its impressive momentum. The stock is up +15.4% this year, handily outperforming the S&amp;P 500 index&rsquo;s +4.1% gain, Amazon&rsquo;s AMZN +3.1% gain, and Target&rsquo;s TGT -3.3% decline in that time period.</p><p>Driving Walmart&rsquo;s stock market momentum has been the company&rsquo;s strong operating performance, reflecting the boost that the business is receiving from its e-commerce unit. The digital offering is allowing the company to offer a variety of convenient delivery and pick-up options, which, combined with Walmart&rsquo;s greater indexing to groceries and reputation for value, is helping it gain market share, particularly among higher-income households.</p><p>This seamless integration of Walmart&rsquo;s digital offering with its enormous brick-and-mortar footprint has enabled the company to offer a genuine competitive challenge to Amazon.</p><p>The chart below shows the one-year performance of Walmart shares relative to the S&amp;P 500 index, Amazon, and Target.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/2a/94530.jpg?v=1021008987" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Unlike Walmart, Target has a much smaller grocery exposure and indexes far more towards discretionary goods and products, the demand for which has been under pressure in the post-Covid period. While there are some other company-specific headwinds as well, the soft outlook for discretionary merchandise has been the primary reason for Target&rsquo;s underperformance.</p><p><strong>Is The Tech Sector&rsquo;s Earnings Outlook Starting to Shift? </strong></p><p>The Tech sector has been a significant growth driver in recent quarters, and the trend is expected to continue in 2024 Q4 and beyond. For Q4, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +11.0% higher revenues, the 6<sup>th</sup> quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth.</p><p>This would follow the sector&rsquo;s +22.7% earnings growth on +11% higher revenues in 2024 Q3. As the chart below shows, the sector&rsquo;s growth trajectory is expected to continue in the coming quarters.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c5/94531.jpg?v=467278330" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The Tech sector has also been among those few sectors that have steadily enjoyed an improving earnings outlook, with estimates steadily increasing. However, the more recent data on this count appears to show a shift in the revisions trend, as the chart below of aggregate 2025 earnings estimates for the sector shows.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/df/94532.jpg?v=1030524897" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong>The Earnings Big Picture </strong></p><p>The chart below shows expectations for 2024 Q4 in terms of what was achieved in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the next three quarters.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/44/94533.jpg?v=1759201955" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>As you can see in the above chart, total S&amp;P 500 earnings for the current period (2025 Q1) are currently expected to be up +7.0% from the same period last year on +4.1% high revenues.</p><p>Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/31/94534.jpg?v=1888404332" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The revisions trend is broad-based, with estimates for 15 of the 16 sectors down since the start of January (Medical is the only sector whose estimates have increased). Sectors suffering the most significant cuts to estimates include Conglomerates, Aerospace, Construction, Basic Materials, Autos, and others. Unlike other recent periods, estimates for the Tech sector have also been under pressure.</p><p>The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/34/94535.jpg?v=1458349276" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>As you can see, the expectation is for double-digit earnings growth in each of the next two years, with the number of sectors enjoying strong growth notably expanding from the narrow base we have been seeing lately.</p><p>In fact, 2025 is expected to have nearly all Zacks sectors enjoy earnings growth, with 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to produce double-digit earnings growth. Unlike the last two years, when the Mag 7 group drove all or most of the aggregate earnings growth, we will have double-digit S&amp;P 500 earnings growth in 2025, even without the contribution from this mega-cap group.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2418227/retail-earnings-a-closer-look?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-earnings_trends-2418227">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

The digital offering is allowing the company to offer a variety of convenient delivery and pick-up options, which, combined with Walmart&rsquo;s greater indexing to groceries and reputation for value, is helping it gain market share, particularly among higher-income households.</p><p>This seamless integration of Walmart&rsquo;s digital offering with its enormous brick-and-mortar footprint has enabled the company to offer a genuine competitive challenge to Amazon.</p><p>The chart below shows the one-year performance of Walmart shares relative to the S&amp;P 500 index, Amazon, and Target.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/2a/94530.jpg?v=1021008987" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Unlike Walmart, Target has a much smaller grocery exposure and indexes far more towards discretionary goods and products, the demand for which has been under pressure in the post-Covid period. While there are some other company-specific headwinds as well, the soft outlook for discretionary merchandise has been the primary reason for Target&rsquo;s underperformance.</p><p><strong>Is The Tech Sector&rsquo;s Earnings Outlook Starting to Shift? </strong></p><p>The Tech sector has been a significant growth driver in recent quarters, and the trend is expected to continue in 2024 Q4 and beyond. For Q4, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +11.0% higher revenues, the 6<sup>th</sup> quarter in a row of double-digit earnings growth.</p><p>This would follow the sector&rsquo;s +22.7% earnings growth on +11% higher revenues in 2024 Q3. As the chart below shows, the sector&rsquo;s growth trajectory is expected to continue in the coming quarters.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c5/94531.jpg?v=467278330" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The Tech sector has also been among those few sectors that have steadily enjoyed an improving earnings outlook, with estimates steadily increasing. However, the more recent data on this count appears to show a shift in the revisions trend, as the chart below of aggregate 2025 earnings estimates for the sector shows.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/df/94532.jpg?v=1030524897" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong>The Earnings Big Picture </strong></p><p>The chart below shows expectations for 2024 Q4 in terms of what was achieved in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the next three quarters.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/44/94533.jpg?v=1759201955" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>As you can see in the above chart, total S&amp;P 500 earnings for the current period (2025 Q1) are currently expected to be up +7.0% from the same period last year on +4.1% high revenues.</p><p>Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/31/94534.jpg?v=1888404332" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The revisions trend is broad-based, with estimates for 15 of the 16 sectors down since the start of January (Medical is the only sector whose estimates have increased). Sectors suffering the most significant cuts to estimates include Conglomerates, Aerospace, Construction, Basic Materials, Autos, and others. Unlike other recent periods, estimates for the Tech sector have also been under pressure.</p><p>The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/34/94535.jpg?v=1458349276" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>As you can see, the expectation is for double-digit earnings growth in each of the next two years, with the number of sectors enjoying strong growth notably expanding from the narrow base we have been seeing lately.</p><p>In fact, 2025 is expected to have nearly all Zacks sectors enjoy earnings growth, with 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to produce double-digit earnings growth. Unlike the last two years, when the Mag 7 group drove all or most of the aggregate earnings growth, we will have double-digit S&amp;P 500 earnings growth in 2025, even without the contribution from this mega-cap group.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2418234/retail-earnings-a-closer-look?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-earnings_outlook-2418234">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 3 REIT Stocks to Buy with Dividends Over 8%: ABR, ALX, NLY ]]>

<![CDATA[ <iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2KMF3I6mRw" width="560"></iframe><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Income investors are drawn to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) as these stocks tend to offer sizable dividends.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Furthermore, REITs offer a cheaper alternative to property ownership without having to break the bank to buy or invest in these expensive tangible assets directly. Outside of a lower capital requirement, investors prefer REITs because of their diversification and tax advantages, such as not being subject to corporate tax in many instances.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Liquidity is also a prime benefit of investing in REITs since they are traded on stock exchanges, making them more liquid than physical properties. Despite the implied volatility of the stock market, REITs are managed by professionals, which alleviates the strains of property management.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Lastly, by law, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders, which is why they tend to have such lofty dividends.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Keeping this in mind, here are three highly ranked REITs to consider with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Arbor Realty Trust - ABR </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Trading under $15 a share, Arbor Realty Trust ABR</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;stock is standing out with the highest dividend yield on the list at 12.46%. Arbor Realty is a specialized real estate finance company that invests in real estate-related-bridge and mezzanine loans, preferred equity, and mortgage-related securities.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Notably, Arbor Realty has increased its dividend 12 times in the last five years with an annualized dividend growth rate of 9.05% during this period. Making its affordable price tag and monstrous dividend more appealing is that ABR trades at 8X forward earnings, which is on par with its Zacks REIT and Equity Trust Industry average and well below the benchmark S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 23.1X.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/92/94525.jpg?v=1936451618" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Alexander&rsquo;s - ALX</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Having a niche in leasing, managing, developing, and redeveloping properties, Alexander&rsquo;s ALX</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;immense profitability is being magnified by its 8.91% annual dividend.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Alexander&rsquo;s generous dividend and earnings potential tend to keep investors engaged with ALX trading around $205 and at 17.8X forward earnings. Trading beneath the benchmark, ALX is near its Zacks REIT and Equity Trust-Other Industry average of 15.3X forward earnings. Most intriguing and indicative of more upside for ALX is that over the last 30 days, fiscal 2025 and FY26 EPS estimates have soared 15% and 27%, respectively.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/32/94526.jpg?v=1308291783" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Annaly Capital Management - NLY</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Rounding out the list is Annaly Capital Management NLY</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">, which manages a portfolio of mortgage pass-through certificates, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), and credit risk transfers. Annaly&rsquo;s holdings may also comprise other securities with interests or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans, residential mortgage loans, and corporate debt.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Hitting a 52-week high of $21 a share, NLY has spiked +17% year to date but still trades at just 7.5X forward earnings.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/41/94527.jpg?v=1011667806" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Even better, the rally could continue with FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates nicely up in the last month for Annaly as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/66/94528.jpg?v=268022048" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Plus, the cherry on top of its strong stock performance is that NLY has a 12.14% annual dividend yield that towers over the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 1.18% average and tops the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust Industry average of 11.47%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ee/94529.jpg?v=2027670425" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Bottom Line </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Considering their reasonable valuations, now appears to be an ideal time to buy these top-rated REITs. To that point, they may be poised to outperform the broader market in the near future, and their sizable dividends make them suitable for long-term investors.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418222/3-reit-stocks-to-buy-with-dividends-over-8-abr-alx-nly?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-video_blog-2418222">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Fed Minutes, Q4 Earnings Keep Market Indexes Alight ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 23:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Wednesday, February 19, 2025</strong><br /><br />Market indexes fought back and closed in the green for today&rsquo;s trading session &mdash; all but the small-cap Russell 2000, which also improved but didn&rsquo;t quite make it into positive territory. The S&amp;P 500 set its second-straight record closing high, at 6144, but ultimately today&rsquo;s gains were modest.<br /><br />The Dow closed up +71 points, or +0.16% on the day. The S&amp;P 500 grew +14 points, +0.24%. The Nasdaq added almost +15 points, +0.075%, while the Russell 2000 was -7.9 points for the session, -0.34%. Bond yields once again appear range-bound, with the 10-year around +4.53% and the 2-year +4.27%.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>Fed Minutes Offer No Surprises</h2><br /><p>As we&rsquo;d expected, the minutes of the latest <strong>Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)</strong> meeting from last month was a firm attitude that inflation metrics will have to once again start coming down before new rate cuts will be considered. The unanimous decision to keep the Fed funds rate between a range of +4.25-4.50%. The FOMC had cut three times in a row between September and December of last year, taking the rate down 100 basis points (bps) in the process. The next Fed meeting concludes a month from today.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>Q4 Earnings Roundup: CVNA, TOST, KVYO</h2><br /><p>Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-rated <strong>Carvana </strong>CVNA far outpaced expectations on both top and bottom lines in its Q4 report out after today&rsquo;s closing bell, with earnings more than doubling estimates to 56 cents per share from 24 cents in the Zacks consensus (and in a completely new orbit from the -$1.00 loss per share in the year-ago quarter). Revenues came in at $3.55 billion, well beyond the $3.33 billion anticipated.&nbsp;<br /><br />This all said, it appears we have a &ldquo;sell the news&rdquo; situation: shares are trading -10% in the after-market, shaving off a good portion of the +328% gains the stock has made year to date, and +440% over the past year. Carvana revenues actually came down quarter over quarter, but had adjusted EBITDA margin growth of +10.1%.<br /><br /><strong>Check out the updated Zacks Earnings Calendar here.</strong><br /><br />A day after a report that point-of-sale service provider <strong>Toast</strong> TOST won a 500-restaurant deal with Huddle House and Perkins parent Ascent Hospitality, Q4 earnings came in slightly mixed this afternoon: earnings of $0.05 per share missed estimates by a penny, on quarterly sales of $1.34 billion, which outperformed the $1.31 billion in the Zacks consensus. Shares had initially zoomed up +10% on the news, but have now come back down near today&rsquo;s closing level.<br /><br />Marketing automation platform <strong>Klaviyo</strong> KVYO is one company whose shares went up on its Q4 report after today&rsquo;s close and stayed there: +7% as of now. This adds to the nearly +14% the stock has gained year to date. Earnings beat by a penny to 7 cents per share, and sales in the quarter strongly outpaced expectations, to $270 million from $257.3 million projected. Big upward moves in revenue guidance for both next quarter and the full fiscal year are helping keep interest in the shares very healthy.<br /><br />Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

<![CDATA[ <iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0wZ6pNalR4?rel=0" width="560"></iframe><p>As the aggressive growth stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research Brian Bolan usually looks for stocks that have a strong Zacks Style Score for Growth and a weak Style Score for Value. This week he is looking at two stocks that are priced under $10. One is an up and coming oil play and the other was founded by none other than Jessica Alba.</p><p>Prairie Operating Company PROP is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a B for Growth and a C for Value in the Zacks Style Scores. The $240M market cap company has inked a deal for $602M, dramatically changing the stock outlook. In the video Brian reviews the dramatic change in revenue growth the company is expected to see.</p><p>The Honest Company HNST is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it has an A for Growth and a D for Value. This company makes beauty products and hand sanitizers and plenty of other consumer goods. It isn&rsquo;t all that often that we hear of an actor/actress starting a company that goes public down the road but that is just what happened for the Honest Company. Brian maintains his delusion that Jessica Alba is going to comment on his video &ndash; but we all know he is barking up the wrong tree. Jessica Alba would never communicate with a guy who has such a hideous freckle under his eye!</p><p>Just as in all of his Aggressive Growth Zacks Rank Buy videos, Brian reviews the earnings history, earnings estimates, growth projections and valuation before taking a look at the chart.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418076/prairie-operating-company-prop-and-the-honest-company-hnst-are-aggressive-growth-stocks?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-video_blog-2418076">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

(PANW), as well as two micro-cap stocks, Seneca Foods Corp. (SENEA) and Crown Crafts, Inc. (CRWS).

The Zacks analyst believes that steady user growth across all regions and increased engagement for its products have been major growth drivers for Meta. The company&rsquo;s growing footprint among young adults, driven by improving recommendations, boosts its competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">(You can&nbsp;read the full research report on Meta Platforms here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>BlackRock&rsquo;</strong>s shares have underperformed the Zacks Financial &ndash; Investment Management&nbsp;industry over the past six months (+13.6% vs. +19.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that higher expenses, owing to higher general and administration costs, are expected to hurt profits. BlackRock&rsquo;s reliance on overseas revenues exposes it to geopolitical tensions, different regulatory/economic environments and exchange rate fluctuation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">Yet planned acquisitions of Preqin and HPS Investment, along with the buyouts of Global Infrastructure Partners and a 75% stake in SpiderRock, have boosted revenues. Efforts to expand into alternatives and private equity, as well as its solid assets under management (AUM) balance, have also aided the firm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">(You can&nbsp;read the full research report on BlackRock here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">Shares of<strong> Palo Alto</strong> have outperformed the Zacks &nbsp;Security&nbsp;industry over the past two years (+146.1% vs. +122.6%). Per the Zacks analyst, the company has been benefiting from continuous deal wins and the increasing adoption of its next-gen security platforms. Product innovation, a shift in its business model to subscription-based services, platform integration and continued investments in the go-to-market strategy have also aided.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">However, softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds may hurt its near-term prospects.

The Zacks analyst believes that strategic inventory reductions and improved cash flow highlight financial discipline, while its diversified product mix, including brands like Libby&rsquo;s and Green Giant, supports market leadership in packaged fruits and vegetables.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">Yet, rising costs from weather impacts, higher LIFO charges, increased interest expenses, competitive pressures, raw material volatility and customer concentration underscore challenges in sustaining growth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">(You can&nbsp;read the full research report on Seneca Foods here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Crown Crafts&rsquo; </strong>shares have outperformed the Zacks Textile &ndash; Home Furnishing industry over the past six months (-8.0% vs. -13.0%). The Zacks analyst believes that the acquisition of Baby Boom Consumer Products in July 2024 has proven immensely profitable for the company. Improved gross margin, manageable debt structure and a strategic initiative to consolidate warehouse operations have also aided.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">Yet, heavy customer concentration poses revenue risks while rising inventory levels and macroeconomic sensitivity expose liquidity pressures. Reliance on China for sourcing increases tariff and supply chain risks. Weak legacy sales signal challenges, despite expanding retail channels and strong licensing opportunities.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;">(You can&nbsp;read the full research report on Crown Crafts here &gt;&gt;&gt;)</span></p><p><b>Today's Must Read</b></p><p>User Growth, Instagram Strength Aids Meta Platforms (META)<br></p><p>Palo Alto (PANW) Rides on Product Strength, Marketing Effort<br></p><p>Buyouts, Solid AUM Aid BlackRock (BLK), Higher Costs a Woe<br></p><p><b>Featured Reports</b></p><p>Investments to Benefit Entergy (ETR), Poor Financials Woe<br>Per the Zacks analyst, Entergy's solid investments are expected to boost its grid upgrades and customer reliability.

A strong emphasis on cost discipline and improving operational efficiency is a tailwind.</p><p>Hormel Foods (HRL) Expands Foodservice with Innovation<br>Per the Zacks analyst, Hormel's Foodservice segment is growing with solution-based innovations and expansion into convenience channels. In the fourth quarter of 2024, sales rose 1.3% year over year.</p><p>Edwards (EW) Rides on Solid TAVR Sales and Global Prospects<br>Per the Zacks analyst, Edwards' strong TAVR sales in the domestic and global markets is a major positive.

<![CDATA[ <iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1YLwau3G9Lc?rel=0" width="560"></iframe><p>Chinese tech stocks have been red hot lately, while the Magnificent Seven have lost some of their shine. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks the 30 largest tech stocks listed in Hong Kong, is up 30% year-to-date.</p><p>Investors have been piling into these stocks since DeepSeek&#39;s breakthrough. While many questions remain about DeepSeek, its AI was likely developed at a fraction of the cost of its U.S. competitors and without access to NVIDIA&rsquo;s NVDA most advanced chips. This suggests that China is not far behind the U.S. in the AI race.</p><p>On Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with tech leaders, signaling that Beijing&rsquo;s regulatory crackdown on the sector&mdash;which began in 2020&mdash;is over. Chinese tech giants lost hundreds of billions in market cap, and despite the recent recovery, their shares remain far below their previous peaks.</p><p>Alibaba BABA stock has surged more than 50% this year, thanks in part to its AI partnership with Apple AAPL to roll out the iPhone maker&rsquo;s AI features in China.</p><p>Goldman Sachs raised its target price for Chinese stocks on Monday, estimating that AI adoption could boost earnings growth and potentially attract $200 billion in inflows.</p><p>Compelling valuations have also drawn some foreign investors to Chinese equities. Some institutional investors have pulled money out of relatively expensive Indian markets and shifted into Chinese stocks.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether this rally can continue. In October last year, Chinese stocks surged after policymakers introduced sweeping stimulus measures to boost growth.</p><p>Billionaire investor David Tepper told CNBC at the time that he was bullish on Chinese equities, saying he had bought &quot;everything&quot; related to China. However, the rally later lost steam.</p><p>Beyond President Trump&rsquo;s tariffs, other macroeconomic and geopolitical risks could present headwinds to this rally.</p><p>The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF KWEB provides exposure to Chinese internet companies listed on Hong Kong or U.S. exchanges.</p><p>The Invesco China Technology ETF CQQQ holds Chinese technology stocks, while the iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI invests in large-cap Chinese equities trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.</p><p>Alibaba (BABA), Tencent Holdings TCEHY, JD.com JD, and Pinduoduo PDD are among the top holdings in these ETFs.</p><p>To learn more, please watch the short video above.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418066/what-s-behind-the-surge-in-chinese-tech-stocks-etfs?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2418066">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Should You Buy, Hold, or Sell SMCI Stock Before Filing Deadline? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Super Micro Computer, Inc</strong>.&rsquo;s SMCI shares have bounced back strongly this year after a weak performance last year. The recent business update has boosted momentum, with investors anticipating no hiccups in the company&rsquo;s highly-anticipated 10-K filing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Is now a good time to bet on the Supermicro stock, or should a wait-and-see approach be considered? Let&rsquo;s find out &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2>What Bothered SMCI Stock in 2024?&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A plethora of discouraging news impacted the Supermicro stock last year. Supermicro was allegedly involved in accounting violations, per a short seller. The DOJ also investigated Supermicro for accounting irregularities.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Supermicro received a non-compliance letter from the Nasdaq, raising the chances of being de-listed from the tech-heavy index. The situation worsened when Supermicro announced a delay in filing its annual 10-K report.</p><h2>Why is SMCI Stock Gaining This Year?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Things are looking brighter for Supermicro this year as management aims to publish last fiscal year&rsquo;s 10-K report before Feb. 25. Supermicro&rsquo;s previous auditor, Ernst &amp; Young, resigned due to management disputes. However, the company now works with reputed accounting firm BDO, ensuring timely SEC report filings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Supermicro&rsquo;s encouraging 2026 revenue growth estimates also boosted the stock price. Supermicro CEO Charles Liang expects revenues of $40 billion next year, way above the current consensus of $29.2 billion. The demand for Supermicro&rsquo;s direct-liquid cooling technology is set to spike next year due to data centers&rsquo; heat issues and likely boost sales.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Supermicro stock has soared 83.5% year to date, breezing past the Computer- Storage Devices industry&rsquo;s gain of 17.3%. The Supermicro stock is now one of the top-performing stocks on the S&amp;P 500, with its shares trading above the 50-day short-term moving average, indicating an imminent uptrend.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/2a/94408.jpg?v=138607951" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p><p><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>How to Trade SMCI Stock Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Considering the robust revenue growth and the expected prompt 10-K filings, it is advisable to hold Supermicro stock for gains in the long run. And why not? Supermicro&rsquo;s synergy with <strong>NVIDIA Corporation </strong>NVDA through the Blackwell platform has boosted its artificial intelligence (AI) computing power, trimmed operational expenses, and strengthened its market position.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Supermicro also uses energy-efficient technologies in operations, a boon once global environmental regulations tighten. Moreover, Supermicro&rsquo;s return on equity of 34% is higher than the industry&rsquo;s 23%, signifying strong profitability.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c5/94409.jpg?v=820265556" /></p><p><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>At the same time, the Supermicro stock remains reasonably priced. This is because, per the price/earnings ratio, SMCI trades at 20.3X forward earnings. In comparison, the industry&rsquo;s forward earnings multiple is 22.05.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/df/94410.jpg?v=2094851420" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p><p><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, skeptics doubting Supermicro&rsquo;s growth story may prefer to wait until Feb. 25 for a better financial insight before betting on the SMCI stock. For now, SMCI stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418064/should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-smci-stock-before-filing-deadline?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|investment_ideas-2418064">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

The figure was within management&rsquo;s guided range of $1.325-$1.365 billion. The top line was driven by broad-based demand for its solutions amid robust design activity and solid execution.<br /><br />CDNS ended the quarter with a backlog of $6.8 billion and current-remaining performance obligations of $3.4 billion.<br /><br />The company highlighted that the AI super cycle was now entering a new phase. The focus on Generative AI, Agentic AI and Physical AI is leading to an exponential increase in computing demand and semiconductor innovation. CDNS has been collaborating with several tech giants including Qualcomm and NVIDIA on their next-generation AI designs across both training and inferencing.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Cadence Design Systems, Inc.

The company is also expanding partnerships with its foundry partners like Taiwian Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel and Arm Holdings.<br /><br />Management initiated its outlook for 2025.

Shares of Cadence have lost 1.9% against the Computer - Software industry&rsquo;s growth of 8.6% in the past year.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f3/94418.jpg?v=2135547880" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>CDNS Business Segment Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Product &amp; Maintenance</strong> revenues (91.4% of total revenues) of $1.239 billion rose 26.2% year over year. <strong>Services </strong>revenues (8.6%) of $117 million increased 34.5% year over year. Our estimate for revenues from Product &amp; Maintenance and Service segments was $1.229 billion and $117 million, respectively. Geographically, the Americas, China, Other Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Japan contributed 49%, 13%, 17%, 15% and 6%, respectively, to total revenues in the reported quarter.<br /><br />Product-wise, <strong>Core EDA, Intellectual Property and Systems Design &amp; Analysi</strong>s accounted for 68%, 13% and 19% of total revenues, respectively.<br /><br />The <strong>System Design &amp; Analysis</strong> business benefited from the multi-physics portfolio along with AI-driven design-optimization platforms, with revenues from this segment increasing 40% in 2024. Acquisition of BETA CAE and higher demand for its Allegro X design and Integrity 3D-IC platform were other tailwinds.<br /><br />CDNS&rsquo; <strong>core EDA business</strong> (constitutes Custom IC, Digital IC and Functional Verification businesses) witnessed 15% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Demand for the new hardware systems was the primary catalyst along with the rapid adoption of digital full-flow solutions, and Virtuoso Studio and Spectre offerings. In 2024, hardware solutions added more than 30 customers and almost 200 repeat customers, especially among AI and hyperscale clients. The digital portfolio had 36 new full-flow customers in 2024, including 17 in the fourth quarter.

<![CDATA[ Airline Stock Roundup: CPA's Q4 Earnings, LUV's Cost-Cut Move & More ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">In the past week, <strong>Copa Holdings</strong> CPA reported mixed results for the fourth quarter of 2024. While earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues lagged the same.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a bid to reduce costs, <strong>Southwest Airlines</strong> LUV announced that it will lay off roughly 1,750 employees in its leadership ranks. This will be the first job cut in the low-cost carrier&rsquo;s history. On a somber note, a <strong>Delta Air Lines</strong> DAL flight crashed in Toronto. At least 18 people were injured due to the mishap. Meanwhile, Mexican carrier <strong>Controladora Vuela Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de Aviaci&oacute;n</strong> or Volaris VLRS reported a year-over-year increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs: a measure of air traffic) for the month of January.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Read the last Airline roundup here.</p><h2>Recap of the Recent Most Important Stories</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">1.&nbsp; Copa Holdings&rsquo;fourth-quarter 2024 earnings per share of $3.99 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.84 but declined 10.7% year over year. Revenues of $877.1 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $880.1 million and fell 4.4% year over year due to a 4.8% decrease in passenger revenue.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CPA&rsquo;s management now expects consolidated capacity to grow 7-8% year over year. Operating margin is expected to be in the range of 20-22%. RASM is now expected to be 11.3 cents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CPA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">2. Southwest Airlines has announced plans to lay off a section of its workforce. The move is part of the company&rsquo;s transformational plan to simplify its organizational structure, stay competitive, reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. LUV&rsquo;s lay-off plans are targeted toward corporate overhead and leadership positions. LUV aims to cut 15% of its corporate positions (which includes senior leadership and directors) by the end of the second quarter of 2025. LUV expects the layoffs to result in cost savings. The company estimates to save about $210 million this year and roughly $300 million in 2026.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3. On Feb. 17, 2025, a Delta plane crash-landed in Toronto. Fortunately, all 80 people on board survived. The incident occurred amid windy conditions following a snowstorm at Toronto Pearson International&nbsp;Airport. The plane flipped upside down during landing. The ill-fated flight took off from Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">4. In January, Volaris reported a 4.7% year-over-year increase in consolidated capacity (measured in available seat miles). The load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) decreased 1.5 percentage points to 86.6%. The load factor fell as the increase in consolidated traffic (2.9%) was less than the increase in consolidated capacity. Volaris expects total capacity to increase in the 13-15% band in 2025 from 2024 levels.</p><h2>Airline Stocks Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The following table shows the stock price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9e/94474.jpg?v=826691783" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The NYSE ARCA Airline Index inched up 1% to $72.59. Over the past six months, the index has risen by 45%.</p><h2>What&rsquo;s Next in the Airline Space?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Latin American carrier <strong>Azul </strong>AZUL is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 24. Upbeat air travel demand is likely to result in higher passenger revenues, boosting the top line. High costs are likely to have hurt bottom-line performance.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418060/airline-stock-roundup-cpa-s-q4-earnings-luv-s-cost-cut-move-more?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|stock_roundup-2418060">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ HSBC's Q4 Pre-Tax Earnings Jump, $1.5B Cost-Savings Plan Revealed ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>HSBC Holdings</strong> HSBC reported a fourth-quarter 2024 pre-tax profit of $2.23 billion, up substantially from $977 million in the prior-year quarter.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em><strong>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks </strong></em><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong>.<br /><br />Results were aided by lower expenses. However, a fall in revenues, higher expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges (ECL) were the undermining factors.</p><h2>HSBC&rsquo;s Revenues Down, Expenses Dip</h2><p>Total revenues were $11.56 billion, down 11.2% year over year. The fall was primarily due to lower other operating income.<br /><br />Operating expenses declined marginally to $8.6 billion.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the quarter under review, ECL was $1.36 billion, up 32.1% year over year.<br /><br />The common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio as of Dec. 31, 2024, was 14.9%, up from 14.8% as of Dec. 31, 2023. The leverage ratio was 5.6%, stable with the prior-year quarter.</p><h2>HSBC&rsquo;s Quarterly Performance by Business Lines</h2><p><em><strong>Wealth and Personal Banking:</strong></em> The segment reported $2.5 billion in pre-tax profit, up significantly from $175 million in the year-ago period. The rise was driven by an increase in total operating income.<br /><br /><em><strong>Commercial Banking: </strong></em>The segment reported a pre-tax profit of $2.4 billion, down 3.9% from the year-ago quarter. Higher ECL charges and a rise in expenses led to the decline.<br /><br /><em><strong>Global Banking and Markets: </strong></em>Pre-tax profit was $1.4 billion, which increased 37.4% year over year. The jump was driven by higher total operating income.<br /><br /><em><strong>Corporate Centre: </strong></em>The segment reported a pre-tax loss of $4 billion, compared with a $2.7 billion loss in the year-ago quarter.</p><h2>Outlook for HSBC</h2><p>For 2025, management expects banking net interest income (NII) of $42 billion.<br /><br />HSBC targets year-over-year operating expense growth of 3% for 2025.&nbsp;<br /><br />HSBC expects to incur $1.8 billion in expenses by 2026-end related to the business overhaul. These efforts are likely to result in annualized cost savings of $1.5 billion by the end of next year.<br /><br />For 2025, ECL charges, as a percentage of average gross loans, are expected to be between 30 and 40 basis points.<br /><br />HSBC expects a return on average tangible equity in the mid-teens from 2025 to 2027, which excludes the impacts of notable items.<br /><br />The company intends to manage the CET1 ratio within its medium-term target of 14-14.5%.<br /><br />HSBC expects a dividend payout ratio of 50% for 2025.<br /><br />The company intends to initiate a share buyback program of up to $2 billion, which will likely be completed by April-end.</p><h2>Our View on HSBC</h2><p>HSBC&rsquo;s strong capital position, initiatives to strengthen digital capabilities, extensive network and efforts to improve operating efficiency through business simplification plan are expected to support its financials. Although the company&rsquo;s initiatives to improve market share in Asia will support financials, these will lead to a rise in expenses.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>HSBC Holdings Stock Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="HSBC Holdings plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/19/1739969754.png" title="" width="568" /> <p>HSBC Holdings plc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | HSBC Holdings plc Quote</p></div><p>Currently, HSBC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&#39;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Performance of HSBC Competitors</h2><p><strong>Barclays </strong>BCS reported fourth-quarter 2024 net income attributable to ordinary equity holders of &pound;956 million ($1.22 billion) against a net loss of &pound;111 million in the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />An increase in revenues (driven by solid investment banking [IB] performance), lower operating expenses (showing the success of cost-efficiency initiatives) and a solid balance sheet supported the results. However, BCS recorded a rise in credit impairment charges in the quarter.<br /><br /><strong>UBS Group AG</strong> UBS reported a fourth-quarter 2024 net profit attributable to shareholders of $770 million against a net loss of $279 million in the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />Results were driven by the strong performances of the Global Wealth Management, Asset Management and Investment Bank divisions. The decrease in operating expenses was another positive for UBS. However, an increase in credit loss expenses was a headwind.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418059/hsbc-s-q4-pre-tax-earnings-jump-1-5b-cost-savings-plan-revealed?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418059">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Alcoa Stock Surges 35% in a Year: Still Worth Buying? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Alcoa Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s AA investors have been witnessing some short-term gains from the stock of late. Shares of the alumina, aluminum and bauxite products provider have surged 35% in the past year, outperforming the industry and S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s growth of 11.9% and 23.2%, respectively. The company has also outperformed its peers like <strong>Constellium SE</strong> CSTM and <strong>Olympic Steel, Inc.</strong> ZEUS, which have declined 51.7% and 48.6%, respectively, over the said time frame.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AA Stock 1-Year Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/eb/94442.jpg?v=1666170120" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Closing at $37.01 on Tuesday, the stock is trading below its 52-week high of $47.77 but higher than its 52-week low of $24.86. The stock is also trading close to its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating stability in the price.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s Behind Alcoa Stock&rsquo;s Momentum?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The strongest driver of Alcoa&rsquo;s business at the moment is solid momentum in the Aluminum segment. An increase in demand for aluminum in both Europe and North America has been supporting the segment&rsquo;s growth of late.<br /><br />Solid momentum in the electrical and packaging markets and recovery in the building &amp; construction sector have been supporting the segment&rsquo;s growth. For 2025, the company expects the Aluminum segment to produce 2.3-2.5 million tonnes, while shipments are anticipated to be in the band of 2.6-2.8 million tonnes.<br /><br />Alcoa&rsquo;s Alumina segment has been reaping the benefits from higher shipments of alumina and increased smelter production. As part of its Sustana line of products, AA recently announced its first sales of EcoSource non-metallurgical alumina. Also, its low-carbon EcoLum primary aluminum currently comprises half of its metal sales in Europe. For 2025, alumina production is anticipated to be in the range of 9.5-9.7 million tonnes, while shipments are likely to be 13.1-13.3 million tonnes.<br /><br />The company has announced several strategic actions over the past year to boost its organic growth and simplify its business portfolio. This includes the acquisition of Alumina Limited in August 2024, which enhanced its position as one of the world&rsquo;s largest bauxite and alumina producers. The buyout is expected to provide Alcoa with long-term value creation with greater financial and operational flexibility.<br /><br />Alcoa initiated the sale of its investment in the Ma&rsquo;aden joint ventures valued at about $1.3 billion. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2024, the company made progress with stakeholders to improve the production capacity and long-term outlook of its San Ciprian site.<br /><br />AA&rsquo;s commitment to rewarding its shareholders through dividends is also encouraging. For instance, in 2024, it paid out dividends of $89 million, representing an increase of 23.6% year over year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Alcoa&rsquo;s Earnings Estimate Revision</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s earnings estimates for 2025 have increased 9.1% to $4.43 per share over the past 30 days. Earnings estimates for 2026 have inched up 1.6% to $3.17 per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks </strong></em><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a2/94449.jpg?v=2000597733" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stretched Stock Valuation Remains an Overhang</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AA&rsquo;s lofty valuation remains a concern. The stock is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.69X, higher than the industry average of 8.14X. This elevated valuation could make the stock vulnerable to further pullbacks if market sentiment sours. However, the stock is undervalued compared with its market peer, <strong>Metallus Inc.</strong> MTUS, which is trading at 14.15X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/95/94444.jpg?v=326945609" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Our Final Take</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Robust momentum across Alcoa&rsquo;s Aluminum and Alumina segments, along with its leading position in the alumina and bauxite markets, positions it favorably for impressive growth in the quarters ahead. The company&rsquo;s strategic acquisitions and collaborations with stakeholders to expand its production capacities should also support its top-line performance.<br /><br />Despite its expensive valuation, positive analyst sentiment and robust growth prospects indicate it is the right time for potential investors to bet on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Datadog</strong> DDOG delivered strong fourth-quarter 2024 results that exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but shares tumbled approximately 9% as the company&#39;s conservative 2025 guidance overshadowed the impressive performance. Investors now face a critical decision: hold their positions or wait for a better entry point in what appears to be a transitional year for the cloud monitoring leader.<br /><br />Datadog has emerged as a formidable leader in the cloud monitoring and security space, with its stock rising 12.5% over the past six months. Despite operating in a competitive landscape with established players like New Relic, Dynatrace and Splunk, DDOG has successfully differentiated itself through its unified platform approach and comprehensive multi-cloud integrations.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">6-Month DDOG Stock Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7a/94427.jpg?v=2047062717" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">At the heart of Datadog&#39;s strategy is its ability to provide comprehensive visibility across multi-cloud infrastructures. By integrating deeply with <strong>Amazon</strong> AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services, <strong>Alphabet </strong>GOOGL-owned Google Cloud and <strong>Microsoft </strong>MSFT Azure, Datadog enables organizations to monitor, analyze and optimize their entire cloud ecosystem from a single platform. This unified approach is particularly valuable as businesses increasingly adopt hybrid and multi-cloud strategies to enhance flexibility and avoid vendor lock-in.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">DDOG Crushes Q4 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The cloud observability platform reported robust fourth-quarter 2024 results with revenue reaching $738 million, up 25.1% year over year and comfortably exceeding analyst expectations of $714 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at 49 cents, which surpassed the consensus mark of 43 cents and increased 11.4% from the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />Datadog&#39;s customer metrics remained strong, with the company reporting approximately 30,000 customers by the quarter&#39;s end, up from 27,300 a year ago. More importantly, customers generating annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 million or more increased to 462, up 17% year over year, while customers with ARR of $100,000 or more grew 13% to about 3,610.<br /><br />The company&#39;s platform strategy continues to resonate with customers. By the end of the fourth quarter, 83% of customers were using two or more products, 50% were using four or more (up from 47% a year ago), and 26% were using six or more (up from 22%). These cross-selling metrics indicate Datadog&#39;s success in expanding within its existing customer base.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Datadog&rsquo;s Concerning 2025 Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the strong fourth-quarter results, Datadog&#39;s guidance for fiscal 2025 disappointed investors. The company projected revenues between $3.175 billion and $3.195 billion, suggesting 18-19% growth, substantially below the 25% growth achieved in fourth-quarter 2024. First-quarter 2025 revenue guidance of $737-$741 million implies just 21% year-over-year growth and minimal sequential growth from the fourth quarter.<br /><br />The decelerating growth trajectory caught investors off guard, especially considering the company&#39;s record bookings quarter with more than $1 billion in bookings for the first time. Management attributed the conservative outlook to their guidance philosophy, which bases projections on recent trends with added conservatism rather than incorporating potential acceleration from increased investments.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues is pegged at $3.19 billion, indicating 18.79% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings has moved south by a penny to $1.93 per share over the past 30 days. The figure indicates growth of 6.04% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/00/94428.jpg?v=1670970100" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar</strong></em>.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AI Impact and Growth Investments</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Datadog&#39;s AI-related business continues to show promise, with AI native customers representing approximately 6% of fourth-quarter ARR and contributing about five percentage points to year-over-year revenue growth. The company noted that while the adoption of AI workloads brings opportunities, the immediate monetization of GPU monitoring remains limited as these workloads are still primarily confined to AI native companies rather than mainstream enterprise adoption.<br /><br />Management remains bullish on long-term prospects, emphasizing its commitment to investing for future growth. The company plans to grow operating expenses in the high 20% range year over year in 2025, with significant investments in both sales and marketing and R&amp;D. This spending strategy aims to capitalize on opportunities in under-penetrated geographies, channel partnerships and enterprise accounts.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strategic Product Developments of DDOG</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company highlighted several strategic product developments, including the general availability launch of Datadog On-Call and strong customer interest in their flex logs solution. Management noted a competitive opening in the log management space due to recent M&amp;A activity among competitors, which could present growth opportunities.<br /><br />Datadog also expanded its security offerings, launching a modern approach to Cloud SIEM that doesn&#39;t require dedicated staff, and enhanced its Kubernetes monitoring capabilities. These developments strengthen the company&#39;s competitive position in observability and adjacent markets.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Investment Perspective: Hold DDOG or Wait?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For current shareholders, maintaining positions may be prudent despite near-term volatility. Datadog&#39;s strong platform adoption metrics, expanding product portfolio, and investments in growth initiatives suggest the company is positioning for long-term success. The 29% free cash flow margin demonstrates financial strength that supports these investments while maintaining profitability.<br /><br />However, new investors might benefit from waiting for a better entry point. The significant disconnect between record bookings and conservative revenue guidance suggests a transitional period as Datadog digests recent customer optimizations and investments take time to yield results. Management explicitly noted that sales and marketing investments typically impact results in one to two years, while R&amp;D investments show returns in two to three years.<br /><br />The stock&#39;s valuation remains pricey despite the post-earnings pullback, reflecting Datadog&#39;s market leadership but offering a limited margin of safety if growth continues to decelerate. The stock trades at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S ratio of 13.54x compared to the broader Zacks Internet - Software industry&rsquo;s 3.15x.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">DDOG P/S Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/79/94429.jpg?v=86795779" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Potential investors should monitor enterprise AI adoption trends, which could accelerate Datadog&#39;s growth beyond conservative projections if mainstream companies begin deploying more AI workloads.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion, while Datadog&#39;s fourth-quarter results demonstrate continued execution excellence, the tempered 2025 outlook warrants caution. Long-term investors should hold positions through this transitional period, while those looking to establish new positions might benefit from patience as the company&#39;s investments mature and growth potentially reaccelerates in late 2025 or 2026. DDOG stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ CRL Stock Up on Q4 Earnings and Revenue Beat, Margins Fall ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:51:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.</strong> CRL reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.66, which rose 8.1% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.4%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss of $4.22 per share against the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s earnings of $3.62 per share.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reported full-year 2024 EPS of $10.32, which decreased 3.3% from the prior-year level. The figure, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Following the earnings announcement, CRL stock rose 1% in pre-market trading today.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CRL&rsquo;s Revenues</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues totaled $1.00 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.7%. However, the top line declined 1.1% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level (down 1.8% organically, excluding the impact of acquisition, divestiture and foreign currency translation).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reported full-year 2024 revenues of $4.05 billion, which decreased 1.9% from the prior-year level. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CRL&rsquo;s Segments in Detail</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reports under three segments &mdash; Research Models and Services (&ldquo;RMS&rdquo;), Discovery and Safety Assessment (&ldquo;DSA&rdquo;), and Manufacturing Solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RMS</strong>&rsquo; revenues in the fourth quarter totaled $204.3 million, up 4.3% year over year (down 0.4% organically). The organic decline in revenues was primarily due to lower revenues from research model services and the Cell Solutions business, as well as lower sales from non-human primates (NHPs) in China. This was partially offset by higher sales of small research models. Our model estimated RMS business revenues to be $203 million in the fourth quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DSA</strong>&rsquo;s revenues in the fourth quarter amounted to $603.3 million, down 3.6% year over year and 3.5% organically. The organic decline in revenues can be attributed to lower sales volume and slightly lower pricing. Our model projected revenues of $563.1 million for this segment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Manufacturing Solutions</strong>&rsquo; revenues in the fourth quarter totaled $194.9 million, up 1.6% year over year (up 2.1% organically). The Microbial Solutions business drives organic revenue growth. Our model projected revenues to be $204.7 million for the fourth quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Margins</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The gross profit in the reported quarter was $284.2 million, down 21.9% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s level. The gross margin of 28.4% contracted 757 basis points (bps) year over year due to a 10.6% rise in the total cost of the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses declined 0.7% year over year to $195.7 million. Adjusted operating income totaled $88.5 million, reflecting a 47% decline from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s level. The adjusted operating margin contracted 764 bps to 8.8%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Liquidity and Cash Position</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Charles River exited 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $194.6 million compared with $276.8 million at the end of 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the fourth quarter was $734.6 million compared with $683.9 million a year ago.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">2025 Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Charles River has provided its 2025 financial guidance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/1e/1739973830.png" title="" width="579" /> <p>Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">It expects total revenues to decline in the range of 4.5-7.0% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues is pegged at $3.89 billion, implying a reported decline of 3.4%. Organically, revenues are expected to decline in the range of 3.5-5.5%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted EPS for 2025 is expected to be in the range of $9.10-$9.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $9.93.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Our Take</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Charles River exited fourth-quarter 2024 with better-than-expected results, wherein both earnings and revenues beat estimates. However, the company registered a year-over-year decline in the top line.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Both RMS and Manufacturing Solutions registered growth year over year. However, the company&rsquo;s largest operating segment, DSA, recorded a significant year-over-year decline due to lower sales volume in Discovery Services and Safety Assessment businesses. Overall, organic revenue growth in the Manufacturing Solutions segment was more than offset by lower revenues from the DSA and RMS segments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Contraction of both margins does not bode well for the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, CRL expects biopharmaceutical demand to be demonstrating early signs of stabilization. The company is currently focused on innovation, enhancing its portfolio to support clients from target discovery to non-clinical development and delivering flexible solutions to respond to changing industry and client needs.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Charles River currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are <strong>Quest Diagnostics</strong> DGX, <strong>ResMed</strong> RMD and <strong>Cardinal Health</strong> CAH.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quest Diagnostics reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $2.23, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%. Revenues of $2.62 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.9%.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DGX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DGX has an earnings yield of 5.9% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 4.1%. It beat on earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ResMed, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, posted second-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS of $2.43, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.6%. Revenues of $1.28 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">RMD has an estimated fiscal 2025 earnings growth rate of 21.9% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 13.2%. Its earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.9%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cardinal Health, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, posted second-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS of $1.93, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.3%. Revenues of $55.26 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CAH has an estimated five-year earnings growth rate of 10.7% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 9.3%. Its earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 9.6%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418056/crl-stock-up-on-q4-earnings-and-revenue-beat-margins-fall?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418056">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ ETFs to Bet Big on China Amid Fund Rotation ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">DeepSeek&rsquo;s breakthrough innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) is driving a resurgence in Chinese equities, prompting hedge funds to reallocate funds from India to China at the fastest pace in months, per Bloomberg, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. The bullish sentiment around China&rsquo;s AI-driven technology rally, coupled with expectations of further economic stimulus, has contributed to this rotation.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Market Movements: China Gains, India Declines</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">China&rsquo;s onshore and offshore equity markets have gained over $1.3 trillion in value in the past month, while India&rsquo;s market has contracted more than $720 billion. The MSCI China Index is set to outperform its Indian counterpart for a third successive month, marking its longest winning streak in two years, per the Bloomberg article.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">China&rsquo;s AI Ecosystem Attracts Investors</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">According to Ken Wong, an Asian equity portfolio specialist at Eastspring Investments, DeepSeek&rsquo;s success highlights China&rsquo;s role in the global AI ecosystem. His firm has been increasing exposure to Chinese Internet stocks while trimming holdings in smaller Indian equities that had become overvalued (read: DeepSeek Buzz Boosts China Tech ETFs).</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Renewed Confidence in China&rsquo;s Investability</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">China&rsquo;s appeal is strengthening as investors reassess its long-term potential, particularly in the technology sector. After previous regulatory crackdowns, Beijing appears to be supporting the AI-driven economic shift, as seen in reports that prominent entrepreneurs, including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, have been invited to meet with top government officials. Alibaba has gained $100 billion in market value over the past five weeks, while the Hang Seng Tech Index has entered a bull market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The DeepSeek buzz made the matter even more appealing. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup developing AI models, grabbed headlines with the release of its new R1 model in late January. According to Yahoo Finance, the company revealed that training the R1 model cost just $5.6 million, significantly less than the $100 million required to train OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4 model.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Stimulus Expectations is Positive for China Investing</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond DeepSeek&rsquo;s influence, expectations of further economic stimulus in China are also attracting investors. &nbsp;Government stimulus measures brought investors back to one of the world&rsquo;s most beaten-down markets. Chinese authorities have implemented some of the most significant economic measures in recent years, including interest rate cuts, home purchase incentives and capital market funding schemes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew Swan, head of Asia ex-Japan equities at Man Group, predicts a policy shift toward boosting consumption and encouraging high savings to flow into the economy. Man Group&rsquo;s Asia Ex-Japan Equity Fund has raised its China exposure from 30% to 40% in the past year, while reducing its India allocation from 21% to 18%, per Bloomberg (read: China May Ease Monetary Policy After 14 Years: ETFs in Focus).</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Valuation Gap Favors China</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">China&rsquo;s cheaper stock valuation is another plus. The MSCI China Index is currently trading at 11 times forward earnings compared to 21 times for the MSCI India Index. Analysis of major active Asian equity funds indicates a steady increase in Chinese holdings while Indian allocations are being reduced.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Which China ETFs Should You Buy?</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Below, we highlight a few China-based exchange traded funds (ETFs) that could gain on compelling valuation, recent winning momentum and news of monetary policy easing. These ETFs have considerably low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, indicating cheaper valuation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>First Trust China AlphaDEX Fund</strong>&nbsp;FCA &ndash; Up 6.4% YTD (as of Feb. 14, 2025); P/E: 4.75X</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>iShares China Large-Cap ETF</strong>&nbsp;FXI &ndash; Up 17.2% YTD (as of Feb. 14, 2025); P/E: 10.62X</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Franklin FTSE China ETF</strong>&nbsp;FLCH &ndash; Up 15.4% YTD; P/E: 10.87X</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>iShares MSCI China ETF</strong>&nbsp;MCHI &ndash; Up 16.2% YTD; P/E: 10.89X</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Any Wall of Worry?</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the surge in interest, a complete reversal of fund flows remains uncertain. Morgan Stanley and other India bulls argue that the recent correction in Indian equities may be overblown, with the country&rsquo;s long-term growth prospects still intact. Meanwhile, an additional 10% tariffs imposed on China by Trump have led some firms, such as Amundi SA, to maintain a neutral stance on Chinese equities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418053/etfs-to-bet-big-on-china-amid-fund-rotation?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2418053">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Here's Why Investors Should Give Werner Enterprises Stock a Miss Now ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 17:36:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Werner Enterprises (</strong>WERN<strong>) </strong>is currently mired in multiple headwinds, which, we believe, have made it an unimpressive investment option.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s delve deeper.</p><h2>WERN: Key Risks to Watch</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Southward Earnings Estimate Revision: </strong>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has moved 31.8% south in the past 60 days. For the current year, the consensus mark for earnings has been revised 22.2% downward in the same time frame. The unfavorable estimate revisions indicate brokers&rsquo; lack of confidence in the stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dim Price Performance: &nbsp;</strong>The company&rsquo;s price trend reveals that its shares have plunged 6.2% over the past six months against the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 11.2% rise.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b9/94496.jpg?v=642951115" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unimpressive Earnings Surprise History: </strong>WERN has a discouraging earnings surprise history, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters. The average miss is 42.45%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Weak Zacks Rank: </strong>WERN currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bearish Industry Rank: </strong>The industry to which WERN belongs currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 195 (out of 250). Such an unfavorable rank places it in the bottom 22% of Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly related to the performance of the industry group it belongs to.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A mediocre stock within a strong group is likely to outclass a robust stock in a weak industry. Reckoning the industry&rsquo;s performance becomes imperative.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Headwinds: </strong>Werner&#39;s top line continues to grapple with weakness across both of its business segments.&nbsp; Notably, WERN reported fourth-quarter 2024 revenues of $754.7 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $772 million and dipped 8.2% on a year-over-year basis due to a $52.8 million or 9% decrease in Truckload Transportation Services revenues and a $13.8 million or 6% decline in Logistics revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The truck industry, of which Werner is an integral part, has been persistently battling a driver shortage for several years. As old drivers retire, trucking companies are finding it difficult to find new drivers to take their place since the low-esteem jobs mostly do not appeal to the younger generation.</p><h2>Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector may also consider <strong>United Airlines</strong> UAL and <strong>SkyWest</strong> SKYW. Each stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see<strong>&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">United Airlines has an expected earnings growth rate of 21.11% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL&rsquo;s 2025 earnings per share has been revised 10.6% upward in the past 60 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has an encouraging track record with respect to the earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters. The average beat is 22.93%. Shares of UAL have surged 161.2% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SkyWest</strong>, founded in 1972, is based in St. George and operates regional jets for major U.S. airlines. SKYW&rsquo;s track record of successfully meeting the requirements of each of its airline heavyweight partners bodes well for the company. Revenues from flying agreements (which account for the bulk of the top line) are impressive owing to SKYW&rsquo;s above ability. Owing to an uptick in air travel demand, passenger volumes have been upbeat and are likely to increase going forward as well. This is likely to keep SKYW&#39;s top line in good shape.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SKYW has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company&#39;s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 16.71%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings per share has been revised 7.9% upward in the past 60 days.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418049/here-s-why-investors-should-give-werner-enterprises-stock-a-miss-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2418049">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sea Limited</strong> SE shares are currently overvalued, as suggested by its Value Score of F.&nbsp;<br /><br />In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, SE is trading at 3.68, higher than its median of 2.62 and the industry&rsquo;s 3.11.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price/Sales (F12M)</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1f/94487.jpg?v=1046357354" style="height: 210px; width: 620px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">SE shares have surged 27.2% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector&rsquo;s return of 3.5% and the Zacks Internet - Software industry&rsquo;s rise of 18.4%.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">SE Beats Sector, Industry</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3f/94486.jpg?v=1224475828" style="height: 210px; width: 620px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">SE shares have also outperformed industry peers, including <strong>HubSpot</strong> HUBS, <strong>Workday</strong> WDAY and<strong> nCino</strong> NCNO, in the year-to-date period. While HUBS and WDAY have gained 15.3% and 2.9%, NCNO shares lost 0.7% over the same time frame.<br /><br />SEA Limited&rsquo;s strong performance is driven by consistent top-line growth, supported by the strength of its core segments, which include e-commerce (Shopee), digital financial services (SeaMoney) and digital entertainment (Garena).</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">SE&rsquo;s Growth Fueled by E-Commerce and Fintech Expansion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Sea Limited&rsquo;s impressive performance is largely driven by substantial growth in its core businesses. These segments are pivotal to the company&rsquo;s success, each addressing critical market needs.&nbsp;<br /><br />Shopee dominates the e-commerce space with rapid gross merchandise value (GMV) growth and operational efficiency. This platform has demonstrated significant improvement, solidifying its position as a leader in Southeast Asia&rsquo;s e-commerce market. This improvement is driven by growth in gross orders, highlighting Shopee&rsquo;s expanding user base and enhanced engagement. Shopee&rsquo;s GMV increased 25% year over year, driving significant revenue growth in the e-commerce segment.<br /><br />Shopee increased its monetization by optimizing market dynamics in Southeast Asia, resulting in higher commission rates across the industry. This strategy has helped improve profitability and revenue per transaction while strengthening its position in the e-commerce market.<br /><br />The third quarter was significant for Shopee, as its loan book grew 70% year over year, and 4 million first-time borrowers were added. Active loan users reached 24 million, up 60% year over year. The non-performing loan ratio was stable at 1.2%. Sea Limited engages first-time borrowers through SPayLater, offering a small credit limit and short tenure on Shopee purchases.<br /><br />SPX Express enhances e-commerce by providing fast delivery and cost efficiency. In Asia, 50% of orders are delivered within two days. Improved costs in Asia and Brazil strengthen logistics. The rise of live streaming boosts the content ecosystem, supporting e-commerce growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">SE Expands Gaming Reach With Garena&rsquo;s Global Success</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Sea Limited&rsquo;s digital entertainment segment demonstrated significant growth potential, with total bookings increasing by more than 24% in the third quarter of 2024.&nbsp;<br /><br />This momentum is driven by the success of Free Fire, one of the world&rsquo;s leading mobile games, which consistently attracts more than 100 million daily active users. Garena Free Fire&rsquo;s user base continued to grow, with a 25% year-over-year increase in new users in the third quarter of 2024.<br /><br />Free Fire is one of the world&rsquo;s largest mobile games and continues to captivate users with high engagement and acquisition. In October 2024, it became the first popular online game to partner with Thailand&rsquo;s Zoological Park Organization, introducing the adorable baby pygmy hippo, Moo Deng, to its virtual world.<br /><br />Garena recently launched Need for Speed Mobile in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau and has become the top racing mobile game in terms of downloads in all locations.<br /><br />Garena is enhancing its partnership with Tencent to bring Delta Force, a first-person tactical shooter, to PC and mobile users across Southeast Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America. This collaboration is set to strengthen Garena&rsquo;s gaming portfolio in these regions.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">SE 2025 Estimate Revisions Show Upward Trend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues is pegged at $21.01 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 24.18%.&nbsp;<br /><br />The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $4.05 per share, which has increased by a couple of pennies over the past 30 days. The figure calls for a year-over-year increase of 81.47%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Sea Limited Sponsored ADR Price and Consensus</h3><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Sea Limited Sponsored ADR Price and Consensus" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/90/1739975822.png" style="width: 620px; height: 210px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Sea Limited Sponsored ADR price-consensus-chart | Sea Limited Sponsored ADR Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What Should Investors Do With SE Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Sea Limited is benefiting from strong growth in e-commerce, digital financial services, and gaming, which is driving profitability and market expansion.<br /><br />However, Sea Limited is continuously facing challenges due to rising competition in e-commerce, particularly in Southeast Asia, and the need for sustained investment in logistics and live streaming. Stretched valuation also remains a concern.<br /><br />Sea Limited currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which implies investors should wait for a more favorable entry point.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>InterDigital, Inc. </strong>IDCC is set to showcase a comprehensive suite of its cutting-edge solutions at the upcoming Mobile World Congress 2025, which will be held from March 3 to March 6, 2025, in Barcelona, Spain. With a focus on the future of 6G and its potential to revolutionize communication and content delivery, these solutions are expected to support growth and diversity of media delivered over wireless networks, ultimately enhancing their networking experiences.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How These Innovations Buoy IDCC?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">One of the highlights of InterDigital&rsquo;s showcase will focus on the future of immersive sports entertainment. The demonstration will highlight innovations designed to enhance XR spatial experiences, particularly in the realm of live sports events. These innovations will deliver the highest quality 2D HDR video for live broadcasts, haptic feedback that amplifies immersive experiences, and developments in volumetric video. This combination is expected to engage audiences more deeply with content, offering them a richer, more interactive viewing experience.&nbsp;<br /><br />With the rising use of smartphones, energy consumption has become a significant concern. To address this, InterDigital will showcase its state-of-the-art Pixel Value Reduction solution, tailored for mobile devices. Traditionally used in televisions, this solution is equipped with AI expertise and saves energy without compromising the video quality.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, InterDigital will present its expertise in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), an essential building block of the 6G technology. In this demo, attendees will witness how the company&rsquo;s ISAC-enabled 6G networks, integrated with AI, can enable seamless navigation of an autonomous robot through a smart factory environment without colliding with obstacles.<br /><br />Moreover, in collaboration with Keysight, InterDigital will showcase a sensing solution that leverages existing 3GPP signals and AI to enhance sensing accuracy in dynamic environments. This combination of AI and sensing is expected to unlock a wide range of new use cases for the upcoming 6G era.<br /><br />Another significant demonstration will center on split squeeze computing, a technique designed to optimize AI applications. By dividing AI/ML models into two distinct components that run locally on devices and remotely on servers, this approach balances conflicting requirements such as latency, bandwidth, power consumption, and accuracy. This technique will likely help optimize the performance of AI applications, making them more efficient and scalable across a variety of devices.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Will IDCC Stock Benefit From the Showcase?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">InterDigital aims to become a leading designer and developer of technology solutions and innovation for the mobile industry, IoT and allied technology areas by leveraging its research and development capabilities, technological knowhow and rich industry experience. Its global footprint, diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate different markets are impressive. Apart from the company&rsquo;s strong portfolio of wireless technology solutions, the addition of technologies related to sensors, user interface and video to its offerings are likely to drive considerable value, considering the massive size of the market it licenses.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the rapidly evolving mobile landscape, the company is at the forefront of innovation, providing critical tools that empower the future of wireless communication. The company&rsquo;s presence at Mobile World Congress 2025 underscores its commitment to helping the industry navigate the complexities of network optimization.&nbsp;<br /><br />These advancements are expected to generate incremental demand for InterDigital&rsquo;s solutions, leading to higher revenues. An improved financial performance is likely to propel the stock upward.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">IDCC&rsquo;s Stock Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of InterDigital have gained 93.5% over the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 28.5%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/38/94464.jpg?v=604764217" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">IDCC&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Other Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">InterDigital currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).&nbsp;<br /><br />Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader industry have been discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Keysight Technologies, Inc.</strong> KEYS carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 5.1%. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />Based in Santa Rosa, CA, Keysight is a provider of electronic design and test instrumentation systems. The company&rsquo;s suite of connected car test solutions includes the Virtual Drive Test Toolset, which facilitates automakers to build virtual test routes in the lab by integrating network and channel emulation capabilities and combining data captured in the field.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Arista Networks, Inc. </strong>ANET, sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 at present, supplies products to a prestigious set of customers, including Fortune 500 global companies in markets such as cloud titans, enterprises, financials and specialty cloud service providers.<br /><br />Arista delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 14.77%.

<![CDATA[ Coca-Cola to Launch Simply Pop Prebiotic Drink, Innovates Offerings ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Coca-Cola Company</strong>&rsquo;s KO strategy of becoming a total beverage company is quite on track. The company is optimistic about its powerful portfolio, supported by system&#39;s unique capabilities and meaningful innovations.<br /><br />We note that the company is foraying in the fast-evolving prebiotic soda market via the launch of Simply Pop. The new beverage, which comes in five fruit flavors, will resonate well with customers&rsquo; demand for gut-health drinks. The flavors include lime, fruit punch, pineapple mango, citrus punch and strawberry.&nbsp;<br /><br />Simply Pop will be available for consumers on Amazon and at national grocery stores in 12-ounce cans. The new beverage will debut under the company-owned and recognized Simply brand in certain regions and online via Amazon Fresh in late February this year. The 12-ounce cans will come at $2.49 each, comprising six grams of prebiotic fiber, zinc and vitamin C for boosting immunity.<br /><br />As the prebiotic soft-drink market is evolving fast, the company&rsquo;s new launch is likely to compete against Olipop and Poppi, which have majorly grabbed consumer interest in gut-health beverages. Per sources, Coca-Cola was earlier exploring Poppi&rsquo;s buyout, however, did not finalize any deal.<br /><br />Simply Pop, a new functional beverage, will be focused on health-conscious consumers and capture extra sales and profits for the company. KO&rsquo;s Simply brand initially came as an orange juice brand and is now expanded into other fruit juices, along with mocktail mixes, cocktails and currently sodas.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Coca-Cola&rsquo;s Other Notable Efforts</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">KO&rsquo;s digital initiatives position it well for growth ahead. The company is accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities, hence evolving into an organization that efficiently executes marketing, commercial, sales and distribution, both offline and online. It is strengthening consumer connections and piloting numerous digital-enabled initiatives through fulfillment methods to capture online demand for at-home consumption.<br /><br />This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is progressing well with the rollout of multi-category eB2B platforms with its bottlers globally. Coca-Cola and its bottling partners have been investing to digitize their customer base by integrating fragmented-trade customers into B2B platforms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c6/94489.jpg?v=1015658989" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of this beverage behemoth have gained 10.4% in the past three months compared with the industry&rsquo;s 2.1% rise.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider in Consumer Staples Space</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Freshpet, Inc.</strong> FRPT, a pet food company, delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 144.5%. FRPT currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Freshpet&rsquo;s current financial-year sales and earnings per share (EPS) indicates growth of 24.2% and 74.2%, respectively, from the prior-year reported levels.<br /><br /><strong>United Natural Foods</strong> UNFI, a key distributor of natural, organic and specialty food and non-food products, presently has a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). The consensus estimate for United Natural Foods&rsquo; current financial-year sales and EPS indicates growth of 0.3% and 442.9%, respectively, from the prior-year reported levels.<br /><br />UNFI delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 553.1%.<br /><br /><strong>McCormick &amp; Company</strong> MKC, a manufacturer and distributor of spices, seasonings, specialty foods and flavors, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. MKC delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 12.9%.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MKC&rsquo;s current financial-year sales and EPS indicates growth of 1.4% and 4.1%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418048/coca-cola-to-launch-simply-pop-prebiotic-drink-innovates-offerings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_corporate_actions-2418048">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Homebuilders Trade Lower After Toll Brothers Disappoints ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 17:23:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>The theme this earnings season has been one of expansion as more sectors experience year-over-year growth. Thus far, the percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks that are outperforming the index is on pace to exceed that of last year.</p><p>Last week was the third consecutive such stretch where we saw markets hit with a sizeable morning gap down due to disruptive news. From tariffs and DeepSeek &ndash; to last week&rsquo;s hotter-than-expected inflation data &ndash; the market has faced several major headwinds. Its ability to absorb seemingly negative news and rebound in a strong manner speaks to the underlying demand for stocks in this environment.</p><p>Unfortunately for homebuilders, they&rsquo;ve been left in the dust.</p><h2><strong>Sticky Inflation Casts Doubt on Rate Path</strong></h2><p>In general, homebuilders are feeling less optimistic about the housing market amid high costs and elevated mortgage rates. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index registered at 42 in February, a 5-point drop from January and the lowest level in 5 months.</p><p>Inflation data from January showed part of the Fed&rsquo;s job &ndash; maintaining stable prices &ndash; remains quite difficult. The producer price index (PPI) showed wholesale prices rose 0.4% last month, more than the 0.3% projection. January&rsquo;s PPI rose 3.5% from a year ago.</p><p>On the consumer end, headline CPI showed prices increased 3% over the prior year in January, an uptick from December&rsquo;s 2.9% annual gain. On a monthly basis, headline inflation rose 0.4%.</p><p>Excluding food and energy, the &ldquo;core&rdquo; CPI displayed an annual increase of 3.3%, while the core measure rose 0.4% on a monthly basis. All figures were above forecasts and higher than those from December.</p><p>Notably, market participants pared back bets on interest rate cuts this year, pricing in just one cut following the data.</p><h2><strong>Toll Brothers Falls Short of Estimates</strong></h2><p>Toll Brothers TOL appears to be the latest victim. Yesterday evening, the luxury homebuilder came out with fiscal first-quarter earnings of $1.75 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99/share by 12.06%. The bottom line plunged 22.2% from the year-ago period. Revenues of $1.86 billion also fell short of projections and decreased 4.6% year-over-year.</p><p>The important metrics came in light primarily due to impairments and a delayed joint venture property sale. But management noted that affordability constraints and growing inventories are pressuring sales.</p><p>The fact that mortgage rates remain high is certainly taking a toll on signing activity in the housing market. A shortage of buildable lots and skilled labor is also limiting home production. &nbsp;</p><p>The recent miss was the second such event over the past four quarters. Toll Brothers, a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of -3.2%.</p><p>TOL stock was down more than 8% early Wednesday morning before paring some of the losses:</p><p><img alt="StockCharts" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/30/94498.jpg?v=962130363" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: StockCharts</span></p><h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><p>Despite weakness from homebuilders, the results out of the Q4 earnings season speak to a resilient corporate backdrop. Total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up 13.3% from the same period last year on 5.5% higher revenues.</p><p>Nearly 400 companies are set to report quarterly results in the shortened trading week ahead, including more than 40 S&amp;P 500 companies. Be sure to stay abreast of the latest reports as the fourth-quarter earnings season continues to wind down.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2418046/homebuilders-trade-lower-after-toll-brothers-disappoints?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-investment_ideas-2418046">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Are Options Traders Betting on a Big Move in Revolve Group (RVLV) Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 17:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>Revolve Group, Inc. </strong>RVLV need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the March 21, 2025 $10 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h2>What is Implied Volatility?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h2>What do the Analysts Think?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Revolve Group shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Revolve Group is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Textile &ndash; Apparel industry that ranks in the Top 15% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 8 cents per share to 9 cents in that period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the way analysts feel about Revolve Group right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing.

<![CDATA[ NIKE & SKIMS Collaborate to Revolutionize Activewear With NikeSKIMS ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 17:15:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <strong>NIKE Inc. </strong>NKE rose 6.2% yesterday, following the announcement of a groundbreaking partnership with SKIMS, the brand co-founded by Kim Kardashian and Jens Grede. This collaboration will introduce NikeSKIMS, an innovative brand that merges performance-driven technology with body-conscious design, aiming to disrupt the global fitness and activewear industry.<br /><br />The long-term partnership seeks to redefine sportswear by making it more inclusive and empowering for athletes of all levels. The first NikeSKIMS collection will launch in the United States this spring, with a global rollout planned for calendar 2026.<br /><br />NikeSKIMS will leverage NIKE&rsquo;s expertise in sport science, innovation and athlete insights, combined with SKIMS&rsquo; focus on body inclusivity and sculpting solutions. Designed for both elite and everyday athletes, the collection will feature apparel, footwear and accessories that enhance performance while embracing all body types.<br /><br />For NIKE, this partnership represents an opportunity to blend function with fashion, inviting more athletes into sport and movement with products that make them feel strong, confident and empowered. Through this partnership, SKIMS&rsquo; management envisions setting a benchmark in activewear, seamlessly integrating body confidence and self-expression with NIKE&rsquo;s pursuit of performance excellence.<br /><br />The meticulous craftsmanship behind NikeSKIMS has been emphasized by SKIMS&rsquo; team, ensuring that every detail has been carefully refined to meet the highest standards of functionality and fashion. This dedication to quality underscores the excitement surrounding the debut collection, marking a new era in inclusive activewear.<br /><br />As anticipation builds for the first collection, NikeSKIMS is expected to deliver industry-leading innovation, reshaping performance wear by offering designs that support, enhance and celebrate movement for everyone&rsquo;s body.</p><h2>What&rsquo;s More on NIKE?</h2><p>The announcement has fueled momentum in NIKE&rsquo;s shares, driving a 9.5% jump in the past month in contrast to the 24.9% decline in the past year. The recent rally has also led NKE to outperform the industry&rsquo;s growth of 0.7% in the past month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/62/94490.jpg?v=2133568757" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>NIKE continues to face headwinds from weak sales in its lifestyle segment, declining digital revenues and ongoing challenges in the Greater China market. These factors have slowed revenue growth and pressured profit margins. The company has been particularly affected by sluggish sales across men&rsquo;s, women&rsquo;s and Jordan categories, prompting adjustments to inventory and product timelines. However, these initiatives are expected to create short-term revenue headwinds throughout fiscal 2025.<br /><br />In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, NIKE accelerated its shift away from classic footwear franchises, which have been declining at a faster rate than the overall business. The Greater China market &mdash; a key region for NIKE &mdash; experienced an 11% revenue drop due to weak consumer traffic and lower sell-through rates, exacerbated by broader macroeconomic challenges. Inventory management is also concerning, with higher-than-expected inventory levels in NIKE Direct, though partner-owned inventory has declined year over year.<br /><br />Despite these challenges, NIKE is aggressively reducing aged inventory, aligning supply with demand in NIKE Digital and ensuring marketplace capacity for new product assortments. While these efforts aim to stabilize sales and improve margins, near-term uncertainties persist, requiring close investor attention as the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company navigates its transition.</p><h2>Stocks to Consider</h2><p>Some better-ranked companies are <strong>Birkenstock Holding PLC </strong>BIRK, <strong>lululemon athletica inc. </strong>LULU and<strong> Ralph Lauren </strong>RL.<br /><br />Birkenstock manufactures and sells footwear products. It currently has a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Birkenstock&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 sales and earnings indicates increases of 15.1% and 27.3%, respectively, from the year-ago period&rsquo;s reported levels. BIRK has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.6%, on average.<br /><br />lululemon is a yoga-inspired athletic apparel company that creates lifestyle components. LULU carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LULU&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 sales and earnings suggests increases of 7.6% and 7.1%, respectively, from the year-ago period&rsquo;s reported levels. lululemon has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 6.7%, on average.<br /><br />Ralph Lauren is a major designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products in North America, Europe, Asia, and internationally. RL carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ralph Lauren&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 sales and EPS indicates growth of 5.8% and 16.2%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures. RL has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.5%, on average.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418044/nike-skims-collaborate-to-revolutionize-activewear-with-nikeskims?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_corporate_actions-2418044">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ RYAM Set to Report Q4 Earnings: What to Expect From the Stock? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rayonier Advanced Materials</strong> RYAM is expected to report improvements in its top and bottom lines when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 results later this month.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RYAM&rsquo;s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $436 million, indicating 3.3% growth from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has been unchanged in the past 60 days at a loss of 12 cents per share, suggesting an improvement from the loss of 22 cents incurred in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f5/94437.jpg?v=1529790212" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">RYAM&rsquo;s Earnings Surprise History</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Rayonier Advanced Materials&rsquo; earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed on two occasions, the average surprise being 9.52%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/cd/94438.jpg?v=224709903" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What the Zacks Model Unveils for Rayonier Advanced Materials</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for RYAM this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here, as you can see below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Earnings ESP</strong>: Rayonier Advanced Materials has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% at present.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank</strong>: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Factors Likely to Have Shaped RYAM&rsquo;s Q4 Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this month, Rayonier Advanced Materials provided an update on preliminary 2024 financial results. This may show how it is likely to have fared in the to-be-reported quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">RYAM&rsquo;s net sales dipped 0.2% to $1.639 billion in 2024. Taking into account the $1.208 billion in sales generated in the first three quarters of 2024, sales are suggested to be $431 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. This indicates 2% year-over-year growth from sales of $422 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rayonier Advanced Materials reported a loss from continuing operations of $43 million in 2024, an improvement from the loss of $102 million incurred in the prior year. Adjusting for the loss of $26 million incurred in the first three quarters of 2024, the loss is anticipated to be $17 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, suggesting a narrower figure than the loss of $61 million incurred in the year-ago quarter.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 was $222 million, up 60% year over year and higher than the company&rsquo;s guidance of $205-$215 million for the year. This implies an adjusted EBITDA of $51 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, suggesting a 38% increase from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s actual.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has been improving its product mix and managing operating costs, delivering improved results.&nbsp; Average sales prices for cellulose specialties were expected to be higher as the company has been prioritizing value over volume. Sales volumes for cellulose specialties are expected to have grown, driven by increased volumes from the closure of a competitor&rsquo;s plant, a modest rise in ethers demand and additional volume sold to customers affected by the indefinite suspension of Temiscaming HPC operations.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lower paperboard prices in the fourth quarter are expected to have been offset by increased sales volumes. High-yield-pulp prices are expected to have been down, while shipments are anticipated to have been higher due to the timing of shipments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On Oct. 11, there had been an isolated fire at the company&rsquo;s plant in Jesup, GA, and the plant was operational in less than two weeks. The company anticipated this to impact earnings by $10 million.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Rayonier Advanced Materials Stock&#39;s Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">RYAM shares have surged 60% in the past year compared with the industry&#39;s 40.1% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d4/94439.jpg?v=1759530561" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Earnings Performance of RYAM&rsquo;s Peers</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Smurfit Westrock Plc</strong> SW reported earnings of 28 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2024 compared with 19 cents in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted for non-recurring costs, earnings were 34 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 68 cents.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Smurfit Westrock&rsquo;s net sales skyrocketed 163.4% year over year to $7.54 billion, aided by the positive impacts of acquisitions and growth in corrugated volumes. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.80 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>International Paper Company</strong> IP reported an adjusted loss of two cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2024, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 7 cents per share. This compares with the company&rsquo;s restated adjusted loss of 51 cents per share for the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">International Paper witnessed lower volumes, higher input, and operation and maintenance outage costs, which were offset by an improved price mix. Earnings in the quarter also included a benefit of 46 cents from accelerated depreciation related to strategic mill actions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">International Paper reported net sales of $4.58 billion, down 0.5% from the year-ago quarter, as lower volumes were offset by higher prices. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.7 billion.</p><h2>Stock That Warrants a Look</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here is a company in the basic materials space, which, according to our model, has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this reporting cycle.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Newmont</strong> NEM, ready to release fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 20, currently has an Earnings ESP of +6.44% and a Zacks Rank of 3.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NEM&rsquo;s fourth-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at 95 cents per share, indicating a 90% surge from the year-ago quarter. Newmont has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 22.16%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418043/ryam-set-to-report-q4-earnings-what-to-expect-from-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2418043">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Implied Volatility Surging for Harrow (HROW) Stock Options ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 17:13:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>Harrow</strong><strong>, Inc. </strong>HROW need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the April 17, 2025 $32 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h2>What is Implied Volatility?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h2>What do the Analysts Think?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Harrow shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Harrow is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical &ndash; Drugs industry that ranks in the Top 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analyst increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, and none dropped the estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of 6 cents per share to loss of 1 cent in that period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the way analysts feel about Harrow right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><h2>Looking to Trade Options?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Click to see the trades now &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418041/implied-volatility-surging-for-harrow-hrow-stock-options?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|options-2418041">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Key Factors to Consider Ahead of Public Storage's Q4 Earnings ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 17:13:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Public Storage</strong> PSA is slated to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results on Feb. 24, after market close. Its quarterly core funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are expected to witness a year-over-year increase.</p><p><em><strong>See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</strong></em></p><p>In the last reported quarter, this self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a miss of 1.18% in terms of core FFO per share. However, the figure declined 3.3% year over year. Quarterly revenues of $1.19 billion increased 3.8% year over year.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, Public Storage surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and missed in the remaining periods, the average miss being 0.06%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise</h2> <img alt="Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise" height="296" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/02/1739980237.png" title="" width="609" /> <p>Public Storage price-eps-surprise | Public Storage Quote</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Factors to Note Ahead of PSA&#39;s Upcoming Results</h2><p>Public Storage is likely to have continued to benefit from its strong presence in major metropolitan markets, well-established brand and technological edge during the fourth quarter.</p><p>The company is likely to have maintained its solid financial position, backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. With sufficient liquidity, it remained well-positioned to capitalize on expansion opportunities through acquisitions and development, a trend that is likely to have persisted in the December-end quarter.</p><p>However, the self-storage industry is continuing to experience a softening in demand and operating trends through 2023 and the first nine months of 2024, and this trend is expected to have continued in the fourth quarter as well.</p><p>High interest expenses are expected to have been a spoilsport during the to-be-reported quarter.</p><h2>PSA&rsquo;s Q4 Projections</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues from self-storage facilities stands at $1.10 billion. This suggests an increase from the $1.09 billion witnessed in the year-ago period.</p><p>The consensus mark for quarterly revenues from ancillary operations is presently projected at $74.6 million, up from the $67.3 million registered in the comparable period last year.</p><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $1.18 billion. This indicates a 1.5% year-over-year increase.</p><p>However, we project the fourth-quarter 2024 weighted average square foot occupancy to be 92.2%, down from 92.7% recorded in the prior quarter.</p><p>Further, we estimate an 8.1% year-over-year increase in interest expenses in the fourth quarter.</p><p>PSA&rsquo;s activities during the quarter under review were not adequate to gain analysts&rsquo; confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter core FFO per share has remained unchanged at $4.23 in the past month. However, it calls for a 0.7% increase year-over-year.</p><h2>2024 Projections</h2><p>For the full year, Public Storage projected core FFO per share in the range of $16.50-$16.85. This is based on the company&rsquo;s expectations for a same-store revenue decline of 1.3-0.5% and a same-store expense increase of 2-3.5%. Consequently, same-store NOI is expected to decrease by 2.7-1.3%.</p><p>For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for core FFO per share is pegged at $4.70, indicating a 1.1% decline from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $4.70 billion, calling for an increase of 4.1% from the year-ago reported number.</p><h2>What Our Quantitative Model Predicts for PSA</h2><p>Our proven model does not conclusively predict a likely surprise in terms of core FFO per share for Public Storage this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.</p><p>Public Storage currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><h2>Stocks That Warrant a Look</h2><p>Here are two stocks from the broader REIT sector &mdash; <strong>Gaming and Leisure Properties</strong> GLPI and <strong>Ryman Hospitality Properties</strong> RHP &mdash; that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.</p><p>Gaming and Leisure Properties, scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Feb. 20, has an Earnings ESP of +0.83% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p>Ryman Hospitality Properties, scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Feb. 20, has an Earnings ESP of +4.91% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.</p><p>Note: <em>Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) &mdash; a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418042/key-factors-to-consider-ahead-of-public-storage-s-q4-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2418042">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MediaAlpha has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Higher Pricing &amp; Volumes to Have Been MAX&rsquo;s Drivers in Q4</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s top line is likely to have been driven by Property &amp; Casualty (P&amp;C) transaction value benefiting from growing pricing and higher volumes as participation in MAX&rsquo;s marketplaces continues to scale. The consensus mark for Transaction value is $488.1 million, suggesting more than 100% year-over-year growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MediaAlpha Stock Declines</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MAX shares have declined 25.1% in the past six months. Its industry has surged 78% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has risen 10.1%. The company&rsquo;s stock has lost its value significantly in comparison with its industry peers, <strong>Agora, Inc.</strong> API and <strong>Outbrain Inc. </strong>OB. API has skyrocketed 163.3% and OB has gained 42.7% over the same period.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Six Months&#39; Price Performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6f/94484.jpg?v=1579562233" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock is looking cheaper and is currently trading at a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 12.8X, well below the industry&rsquo;s 50.9X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/bf/94483.jpg?v=907857135" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MediaAlpha&rsquo;s Investment Considerations</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MediaAlpha operates as the largest insurance customer acquisition media marketplace with strong long-term partnerships. This marketplace model is its key differentiator and provides a competitive edge that establishes the company as a growth partner of choice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MAX&rsquo;s top line is anticipated to have been driven by momentum in the P&amp;C vertical as auto insurance underwriting profitability improves. The multi-year extension with Insurify is instrumental in portraying MAX&rsquo;s market leadership position, which enables it to evaluate opportunities to expand and deepen supply partnerships.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, headwinds in the Medicare payer space are likely to hurt the health vertical despite the fourth quarter being seasonally strongest. The company does not pay or plans to pay dividends, which might raise questions about its cash position.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Final Thoughts: Hold MediaAlpha for Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A robust marketplace model, coupled with healthy performance in the P&amp;C vertical, sets the company for long-term growth. The ability to demonstrate market leadership is another advantage. However, headwinds in the Medicare payer domain and reluctance to pay dividends are concerning.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While MAX remains fundamentally strong and possesses a discounted valuation, a cautious approach is warranted. This is because the steep fall in share prices over the past six months indicates declining investor confidence, which may result in a further price decline, especially if the company fails to beat on earnings.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418037/should-mediaalpha-stock-be-in-your-portfolio-pre-q4-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2418037">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>Wells Fargo &amp; Company </strong>WFC have surged 58% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s rise of 58.5%. It has fared better than its peers <strong>JPMorgan</strong> JPM and <strong>Bank of America</strong> BAC over the same time frame.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Price Performance</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fb/94470.jpg?v=1102354331" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given WFC&rsquo;s impressive rally, investors might wonder if the opportunity to add this stock to their portfolio has passed. However, we believe that Wells Fargo has much going in its favor, and this rally is far from over.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Technical indicators suggest continued strong performance for WFC. The stock trades above its 50-day moving average, signaling robust upward momentum and price stability.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">50-Day Moving Average</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/41/94472.jpg?v=1147512380" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let us find out the reasons behind WFC&rsquo;s solid performance this year and whether this is the right time to buy the stock.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Wells Fargo Progresses to Fix Compliance Problems</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Under the leadership of CEO Charlie Scharf, Wells Fargo is strengthening its compliance framework following the fake account scandal. The bank&#39;s improved risk management techniques have received regulatory approval, with progress closely monitored by their operating committee.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;Building the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work,&rdquo; Scharf stated during the fourth-quarter 2024 earnings call.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last week, WFC&rsquo;s 2018 consent order related to its compliance risk management program was terminated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It dealt with the company&#39;s auto lending and mortgage practices, and its compliance risk management program.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this month, WFC confirmed that the Federal Reserve board of governors terminated two longstanding consent orders &mdash; a 2011 consent order regarding the company&rsquo;s legacy mortgage servicing activities and a 2011 consent order regarding its legacy Wells Fargo Financial business.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In November 2024, Reuters reported WFC to be in the final stages of meeting its regulatory requirements to remove the $1.95-trillion asset cap. This asset cap was imposed in 2018 following the revelation of its fake account scandal. Per the report, the asset cap could be removed in the first half of 2025, provided the bank resolves its risk management and compliance issues. The decision to lift the restriction would require voting from the Federal Reserve&#39;s board of governors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Because of the asset cap, the company is unable to grow to its potential. This is affecting its loan growth. Given that loans are among the largest assets a bank can hold, lifting the asset cap will mark a turning point for Wells Fargo.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">WFC demonstrated that strengthening its risk management and compliance infrastructure continues to be the mainstay of its operational strategy, as seen by the resolution of 10 regulatory consent orders since 2019. This is crucial as the company pursues to strengthen its governance and ensure adherence to regulatory standards.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">WFC to Benefit From Fed Rate Cuts</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s aggressive monetary policy easing is likely to support WFC&rsquo;s NII over time. The Fed lowered the interest rates by 100 basis points in 2024 and indicated two rate cuts for this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The rate cuts are positive developments for WFC, which is reeling under increasing funding cost pressure. While high rates have led to a significant jump in NII, the same has raised funding and deposit costs, thus squeezing the company&rsquo;s net interest margin (NIM).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Wells Fargo&#39;s NII and NIM have been subdued by the increased funding costs as the high-interest rate environment weighed on it. In 2024, NII declined 8% year over year to $47.7 billion. NIM declined to 2.73% in 2024 from 3.06% in 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Management expects 2025 NII to grow 1-3% from the 2024 reported figure.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">NII Outlook</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Wells Fargo &amp; Company" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fb/91667.jpg?v=1051622263" style="width: 500px; height: 315px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Wells Fargo &amp; Company</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">WFC&rsquo;s Branch Network Optimization &amp; Expense Management</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Wells Fargo keeps investing in and optimizing its branch network. It is being more deliberate about branch location strategy, as the number of branches declined 3% year over year to 4,177 in 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As part of its attempts to improve the branch experience, the company is investing more in branch staff and upgrading technology. One such improvement is a new digital account opening process that has proven beneficial for bankers and consumers alike.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Management is keen on updating its branches. It already upgraded 730 of them in 2024. The company plans to update all the branches in the next five years.<br />WFC&#39;s mobile user base is expanding rapidly. It grew mobile active customers by 1.5 million in 2024, up 5% from a year ago. This momentum is expected to continue as the company undergoes improvements to provide clients with more self-service options and value-added information, such as balanced trends and subscription expenditure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Wells Fargo&rsquo;s prudent expense management initiatives have been supporting its financials. The company has been actively engaged in cost-cutting measures, including streamlining organizational structure, branch closure and headcount reductions. By the end of 2024, its headcount declined 3.5% from 2023-end.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Management expects $2.4 billion of gross expense reductions in 2025, driven by efficiency initiatives.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Non-Interest Expense Outlook</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Wells Fargo &amp; Company" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ea/94471.jpg?v=1359010566" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Wells Fargo &amp; Company</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Is It the Right Time to Buy Wells Fargo&rsquo;s Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">WFC&rsquo;s progress in fixing compliance problems will help lift the asset cap. This will allow the company to offer loans without restrictions, supporting the top-line expansion. Its progress on efficiency initiatives, such as branch and footprint reduction, will support cost reduction. The Fed rate cuts will drive NII and NIM growth in the coming period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given favorable factors, the company&rsquo;s earnings for 2025 and 2026 have been revised upward over the past month, indicating a year-over-year rise each for 2025 and 2026.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Estimate Revision Trend</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/63/94467.jpg?v=516727261" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: center;">Earnings Estimates</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/4a/94468.jpg?v=487203301" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From a valuation standpoint, Wells Fargo appears somewhat inexpensive relative to the industry. The company is currently trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 13.41X, below the industry average of 14.59X.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Price-to-Earnings F12M</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/46/94473.jpg?v=710721367" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock is also significantly cheaper than its peer, JPM&rsquo;s current forward 12-month P/E of 15.13X, while trading at a premium compared with BAC&rsquo;s current forward 12-month P/E of 12.41X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given its inexpensive valuation and positive estimate revisions, the stock is worth considering now. Hence, investors should consider investing their cash in WFC at its current price levels for solid long-term returns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Wells Fargo currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Medifast, Inc.</strong> MED delivered fourth-quarter 2024 results, with the bottom and top lines declining year over year. However, both earnings and net revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar</strong></em>.<br /><br />This year was a transformative period for Medifast as the company adapted to the evolving health and wellness market, driven by the growing acceptance of GLP-1 medications. Throughout the year, the team demonstrated resilience and adaptability, ensuring Medifast remains well-positioned as a leader in health and wellness within a GLP-1-driven landscape.<br /><br />Looking ahead, key priorities include reestablishing growth across essential metrics, enhancing coach productivity through accelerated customer acquisition and increasing the number of active earning coaches. These initiatives are expected to expand reach, restore revenue and profitability growth, and create long-term value for all stakeholders.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>MEDIFAST INC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><h2> <img alt="MEDIFAST INC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/67/1739965265.png" title="" width="574" /> </h2><p>MEDIFAST INC price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | MEDIFAST INC Quote</p></div><h2>Medifast&rsquo;s Quarterly Performance: Key Insights</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MED&rsquo;s adjusted earnings were 10 cents per share in the fourth quarter, down from $1.09 in the year-ago quarter. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of an adjusted loss of 27 cents.<br /><br />Net revenues of $119 million declined 37.7% year over year due to lesser active earning OPTAVIA Coaches and reduced productivity per Coach. The average revenue per active earning OPTAVIA Coach was $4,391, down 5.5% year over year from $4,648 million due to lower customer acquisition. The total number of active earning OPTAVIA Coaches fell 34.1% to 27,100 from 41,000 in the year-ago quarter. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus estimate of $111 million.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>MED Stock Past Three-Month Performance</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/af/94420.jpg?v=1907214467" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>MED&rsquo;s Margin &amp; Cost Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Gross profit was $88.2 million, down 37.6% year over year on reduced revenue volume. The gross margin was 74.1%, up 10 basis points year over year. We expected gross profit to be $75.8 million in the fourth quarter.<br /><br />Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) fell 30.1% year over year to $87.5 million. This decrease was primarily driven by reductions in OPTA VIA coach compensation, employee compensation and nonrecurring costs associated with launching the company&#39;s medically supported weight loss initiative, including collaboration costs with LifeMD. There was a reduction in expenses for coach-related events. However, these savings were partially offset by increased spending on company-led marketing efforts.<br /><br />As a percentage of revenues, adjusted SG&amp;A expenses increased 800 basis points (bps) to 73.5%, attributed to higher company-led marketing expenditure and reduced leverage on fixed expenses. These factors were partially offset by the absence of nonrecurring costs from the previous year&rsquo;s weight loss initiative and lower expenses for coach-related events.&nbsp;<br /><br />The adjusted income from operations declined 95.6% to $0.7 million. We note that the adjusted operating margin decreased 790 bps year over year to 0.6%.</p><h2>Medifast&rsquo;s Financial Health Snapshot</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MED concluded the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $162.3 million, no interest-bearing debt (as of Dec. 31, 2024), and total shareholders&rsquo; equity of $210.1 million.</p><h2>Sneak Peek Into MED&rsquo;s 2025 Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company expects first-quarter 2025 revenues between $100 million and $120 million, with earnings per share (EPS) ranging from a loss of 50 cents per share to break-even. This EPS range excludes any gains or losses resulting from changes in the market price of the company&#39;s LifeMD common stock investment.<br /><br />The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company&rsquo;s shares have lost 11.2% in the past three months compared with the industry&rsquo;s 5.9% decline.</p><h2>Some Better-Ranked Staple Bets</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here, we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely <strong>United Natural Foods, Inc.</strong> UNFI, <strong>Freshpet Inc.</strong> FRPT and <strong>US Foods Holding Corp.</strong> USFD.<br /><br />United Natural Foods is the leading distributor of natural, organic and specialty food and non-food products in the United States and Canada. It presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong><br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNFI&#39;s current fiscal-year earnings and sales indicates growth of 442.9% and 0.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures. UNFI delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 553.1%.<br /><br />Freshpet is a pet food company. It has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Freshpet&rsquo;s current financial-year earnings and sales indicates declines of 227.1% and 27.2%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures. FRPT delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 144.5%.<br /><br />US Foods is a food-service distributor. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2.&nbsp;<br /><br />USFD delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.4%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for US Foods&rsquo; current financial-year earnings and sales indicates growth of 21% and 5.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418035/med-q4-earnings-beat-revenues-dip-y-y-on-lower-customer-acquisition?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418035">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nu Holdings Ltd. </strong>NU has delivered impressive performance over the past month. Its stock has surged 19%, significantly outperforming the industry&lsquo;s growth of 7.5%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NU&rsquo;s peers have shown contrasting performances. <strong>Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A.</strong> BSBR gained 12%, while <strong>SoFi Technologies</strong> SOFI declined 2% during the same period.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/be/94492.jpg?v=4484310" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Considering the current strength of NU shares, investors may wonder if now is the right time to invest in the stock. Let&rsquo;s delve deeper.</p><h2>NU: Disrupting Banking Across Latin America</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As a trailblazer in the fintech industry, Nu Holdings leverages a digital-first and scalable business model to drive down operational costs while boosting efficiency. This innovative approach has positioned NU as a disruptor in traditional banking, enhancing financial inclusion and accessibility across its markets. NuBank, NU&rsquo;s flagship platform, has earned recognition as one of Latin America&rsquo;s most trusted and prominent brands</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In Brazil, a market dominated by traditional banking giants, NU has carved out a distinct identity with its innovative cost structure and customer-centric model. Its customer base continues to grow at an impressive pace, propelled by its digital-first strategy. The company is also making substantial strides in expanding its operations across Latin America, particularly in Mexico and Colombia, where adoption is accelerating. With opportunities to penetrate untapped regions, NU&rsquo;s footprint is poised to expand further. During the third quarter of 2024, the company added 5.2 million customers, bringing its global customer count to 109.7 million. The increasing trend toward digitization is expected to sustain and enhance this growth trajectory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NU&rsquo;s revenue model is highly diversified, encompassing streams such as lending, interchange fees and marketplace services. This diversification not only mitigates risks but also provides stability during economic uncertainties. The company has consistently demonstrated robust revenue growth, driven by higher monetization of its platform and increased user engagement. Key areas like credit cards and personal loans have significantly contributed to its financial success. In the third quarter, NU reported a remarkable 56% year-over-year increase in revenues.</p><h2>NU&rsquo;s Strong Returns on Capital</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Return on equity (ROE), a measure of profitability, reflects how effectively a company uses its shareholders&#39; investments to generate earnings. NU&rsquo;s trailing 12-month ROE is 28.7% compared with the industry&rsquo;s average of 10.8%.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a4/94493.jpg?v=1469130068" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">NU has also shown strong returns on invested capital (ROIC), with a trailing 12-month ROIC of 12.5%, well above the industry average of 4%.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/96/94494.jpg?v=1238127457" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>NU&rsquo;s Promising Top and Bottom-Line Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NU&rsquo;s 2024 earnings is pegged at 42 cents, indicating 75% growth from the year-ago level. Earnings in 2025 are expected to increase 39% from the prior-year actuals. The company&rsquo;s sales are expected to grow 47% and 35% year over year, respectively, in 2024 and 2025.</p><h2>NU Looks Pricey</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">NU stock appears significantly overvalued compared to industry peers, currently trading at 22 times forward earnings, more than double the sector&#39;s average of 10 times. This substantial premium reflects the market&rsquo;s optimism about NU&rsquo;s growth potential, driven by its innovative fintech model, expanding customer base, and strong revenue trajectory. However, such a lofty valuation also introduces risks, as any shortfall in earnings or slower-than-expected growth could lead to a sharp correction.</p><h2>High Prospects, But Timing is Key</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Given Nu Holdings&rsquo; recent surge, the stock appears to be trading at a premium compared to industry peers. While NU&rsquo;s innovative fintech model, robust customer growth and strong financial performance justify its valuation, the current price levels may limit near-term upside potential. Investors should consider holding existing positions to capitalize on long-term growth prospects, particularly as NU expands across Latin America and continues to monetize its platform. However, new investors may want to wait for a pullback or consolidation before entering, as the stock&rsquo;s recent rally may have already priced in near-term optimism.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NU currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ 3 Staffing Stocks to Consider Despite Industry Challenges ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:48:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The Staffing Firms industry is anticipated to attain its pre-pandemic levels gradually, allowing companies to pay regular dividends. The rising adoption of remote work and hybrid models, backed by top-notch technological advancements, will drive the demand for staffing agencies. <strong>HireQuest, Inc. </strong>HQI, <strong>Heidrick &amp; Struggles International, Inc.</strong> HSII and <strong>Cross Country Healthcare, Inc. </strong>CCRN are gaining from technological developments that improve efficiency.</p><p><b>Industry Description</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Staffing industry is a diverse sector encompassing companies that offer a range of human resources and workforce solutions. These services cover various aspects of personnel management, including employment screening, recruitment services for both temporary and long-term job placements, retirement planning, human capital management, payroll administration, performance evaluation, organizational planning, and financial management. Some firms within this industry provide specialized services, such as staffing and risk consulting, professional staffing, and global business solutions tailored to the needs of small to medium-sized enterprises. They also offer organizational consulting services with a global reach, catering to a diverse client base, which includes domestic and international businesses across different sectors and industries.</p><p><b>What's Shaping the Future of the Business Services Industry?</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Stable Demand: </strong></em>The industry is mature. The consistency in demand for services despite the economic downturn in the manufacturing sector has been robust for some time now. Revenues, income and cash flows are anticipated to gradually recover to the pre-pandemic level, allowing most industry players to pay out stable dividends.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Rising Adoption of Remote Work &amp; Hybrid Models: </strong></em>A significant rise in remote work has been observed since the pandemic, and it has made staffing agencies focus on flexible staffing solutions, including hybrid and remote work models. These adaptations help meet the desires of clients and job seekers for a better work-life balance. Given the continued demand for remote work, staffing agencies are expected to prioritize and effectively meet evolving workplace preferences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Tech-Driven Staffing Solutions on the Boom: </strong></em>The staffing sector is using technology to optimize operations, increase efficiency and deliver services at their highest quality. The growing adoption of AI-driven tools and platforms makes attracting, evaluating and onboarding IT talents more effective. The rising adoption of social media and Big Data is being witnessed as well. Video-conferencing platforms, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, facilitate remote communication, and cloud and blockchain technologies bolster HR data security. Such technological advancements ensure that the demand for staffing services continues.</p><p><b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Sluggish Near-Term Prospects</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Staffing Firms industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #198. This rank places it in the bottom 20% of 249 Zacks industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a continued outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let us look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock market performance and current valuation.</p><p><b>Industry Lags Sector & S&P 500</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Staffing Firms industry has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the broader sector over the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The industry has declined 17.4% against the S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s growth of 24.2% and the broader sector&rsquo;s rise of 29.5% in the same timeframe.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">One-Year Price Performance</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/price (2).jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 361px;" /></p><p><b>Industry's Current Valuation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the basis of EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), which is commonly used for valuing staffing stocks because of their high debt levels, the industry is currently trading at 7.48X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 17.7X and the sector&rsquo;s 27.05X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 8.92X and as low as 7.28X, with the median being 7.95X, as the charts below show.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">EV-to-EBITDA</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/ev_sp5m.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 235px;" /></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/ev_zs16m.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 236px;" /></p><p><b>3 Staffing Stocks Poised for Growth</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have presented three stocks that are expected to grow in the near term.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Heidrick &amp; Struggles:</strong> This provider of executive search, consulting and on-demand talent services to businesses and business leaders is benefiting from improving segmental performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">HSII&rsquo;s core Executive Search business is benefiting from strong performances in the Americas and the Asia Pacific regions. Increasing average contract values indicating longer duration projects, along with a rising number of extensions with higher values, are aiding the On-Demand Talent business. Surging leadership assessment and development engagements, coupled with purpose-driven change solutions, are boosting organic revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Heidrick &amp; Struggles currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 bottom line has increased from $2.67 to $2.68 in the past 90 days. Its shares have gained 17.5% in the past six months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="pd4ml-display: none; pd4ml-visibility: hidden;">You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong> </span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cross Country Healthcare: </strong>This talent management and other consultative services provider for healthcare clients is improving from the strength in its current relationships, and momentum in home care, physician staffing and education.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CCRN&rsquo;s home care staffing business is benefiting from the rising number of PACE program wins, and the physician staffing business is growing from higher billable days and revenues per day sales. Improving operating leverage from volume growth and proactive cost management are driving the bottom line.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cross Country Healthcare currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 EPS has increased from 52 cents to 53 cents in the past 90 days. CCRN shares have gained 28.6% in the past six months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HireQuest:</strong> This temporary staffing services provider is riding on the strength and versatility of its franchise model. The increasing sales generated by HQI&rsquo;s temporary staffing brands are driving franchise royalty.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">HireQuest is well-positioned to drive improved financial performance, capitalizing on the stabilizing staffing market and employing disciplined expense management across its business. Headcount reductions made during 2023 related to the integration of MRI Network acquisition are instrumental toward lowering expenses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">HQI currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 2024 earnings has been unchanged at 28 cents per share in the past 90 days. The stock has gained 14.4% in the past six months.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417954/3-staffing-stocks-to-consider-despite-industry-challenges?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-industry_outlook-2417954">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Community Health Q4 Earnings Miss on Lower Adjusted Admissions ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:44:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Community Health Systems, Inc.</strong> CYH reported a fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted loss of 42 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a profit of 5 cents. Also, the bottom line deteriorated from the prior-year loss of 41 cents per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Net operating revenues rose 2.6% year over year to $3.27 billion in the quarter under review. The top line beat the consensus mark by 3.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks </em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong> <strong><em>to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The quarterly earnings suffered from lower admissions, patient days and occupancy rate. However, increased same-store volumes, favorable changes in the payor mix and lower expenses for contract laborpartially offset the negatives.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Community Health Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Community Health Systems, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/ea/1739975232.png" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Community Health Systems, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Community Health Systems, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CYH&rsquo;s Full-Year 2024 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Its revenues of $12.63 billion increased from $12.49 billion a year ago. Adjusted loss of $1.03 per share improved from $1.39 in the previous year. Full-year adjusted EBITDA of $1.54 billion increased from $1.45 billion a year ago. Total operating expense of $12.09 billion rose from the 2023 level of $11.53 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CYH&rsquo;s Q4 Operational Update</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">At the fourth-quarter end, the hospital count for Community Health was 76, lower than the year-ago level of 78.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Patient days tumbled 11% year over year and missed our model estimate by a whisker. The average length of stay decreased 4.4% year over year to 4.3 days, while the occupancy rate of 50.5% declined from 53.5% in the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted admissions declined 5.7% year over year in the quarter under review. On a same-store basis, adjusted admissions improved 3.1% from the corresponding prior-year quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Licensed beds of CYH totaled 11,403 as of Dec. 31, 2024, which indicates a decrease of 4.2% from the prior-year quarter. However, the reported figure beat our estimate by 4.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total operating expenses rose 4.6% year over year to $3 billion in the fourth quarter due to higher other operating expenses and were higher than our estimate of $2.9 billion. Meanwhile, net interest expenses of $218 million increased 4.3% year over year. The metric came higher than our estimate of $212.1 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reported a net loss of $28 million in the fourth quarter compared with an income of $85 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted EBITDA improved 10.9% year over year to $428 million in the quarter under review, primarily due to increased same-store volumes, reimbursement rates, favorable changes in payor mix and lower expense for contract labor. The positives were partially offset by a reduction in acuity and non-patient revenue, higher patient claim denials and costs for outsourced medical specialists. The metric came above our estimate of $400.5 million.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Financial Update (as of Dec. 31, 2024)</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Community Health exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $37 million, which decreased from $38 million at 2023 end. Total assets of $14.1 billion decreased from $14.5 billion at 2023-end.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Long-term debt amounted to $11.43 billion, which decreased from $11.47 billion at 2023 end. Current maturities of long-term debt were $20 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2024, CYH generated operating cash flows of $480 million, up from $210 million in the year-ago period.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CYH&rsquo;s 2025 Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company expects net operating revenue between $12.2 billion and $12.6 billion for 2025 compared with the 2024 figure of $12.63 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be in the range of $1.45-$1.60 billion compared with the 2024 level of $1.54 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Net loss per share is expected to be between 55 cents and breakeven in 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Depreciation and amortization is predicted in the range of $425-$445 million for 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Net cash from operating activities is estimated to be between $600 million and $700 million in 2025. Capital expenditures are anticipated in the range of $350-$400 million. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company expects weighted-average shares outstanding to be $134 million for 2025. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How Did Other Healthcare Stocks Perform?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some stocks in the broader Medical space that have also reported earnings for the December quarter: <strong>HCA Healthcare, Inc.</strong>&nbsp;HCA, <strong>The Ensign Group, Inc.</strong> ENSG and <strong>The Cigna Group</strong> CI.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">HCA Healthcare reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $6.22, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.2%, driven byhigher patient volumes giving rise to an increased number of inpatient surgeries and same-facility emergency room visits. However, the upside was partly offset by elevated salaries and benefits expenses. Additional expenses due to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton also impacted the results.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ensign reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $1.49, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4% thanks to improved occupancy rates, higher patient days and higher skilled service revenues. The positives were partly offset by an elevated expense level due to the higher cost of services and rents.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cigna reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $6.64, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% due to a decline in its overall medical customer base and elevated medical costs. Nevertheless, the downside was partly offset by expanding specialty volumes in the Evernorth Health Services segment and new client wins.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418008/community-health-q4-earnings-miss-on-lower-adjusted-admissions?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2418008">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ CL Set to Expand Hill's Pet Nutrition With the Prime100 Acquisition ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:39:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>As part of its expansion strategy, <strong>Colgate-Palmolive Company </strong>CL announced on Tuesday that it has signed an agreement to acquire Care TopCo Pty Ltd, owner of Australian pet food brand Prime100. This move is part of Colgate&rsquo;s plan to grow its Hill&rsquo;s Pet Nutrition division by entering the fresh pet food market. The acquisition will complement Hill&rsquo;s current specialty pet food products and strengthen its presence in Australia.<br /><br />The deal aligns with Colgate&rsquo;s broader strategy of investing in high-growth adjacent categories while reinforcing its science-backed, veterinarian-endorsed pet food portfolio. The acquisition is expected to provide Hill with opportunities for expanded distribution and increased brand awareness, capitalizing on Prime100&rsquo;s premium positioning and veterinary endorsement.<br /><br />While the transaction is not expected to significantly impact CL&rsquo;s 2025 earnings, it reinforces the company&rsquo;s commitment to long-term growth in the pet nutrition sector. The acquisition will be funded through a mix of debt and cash.</p><h2>More Insights Into CL&rsquo;s Strategic Expansion</h2><p>Prime100, based in Melbourne, has been a leading brand in fresh pet food since 2014, offering both refrigerated and shelf-stable products backed by science and recommended by vets. The deal is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2025, pending approval from Australian regulators.</p><p>Prime100 is a trusted, vet-approved premium brand with a unique market position that aligns with our long-term pet nutrition growth strategy. This acquisition brings a high-growth, profitable fresh dog food brand to the Hill&rsquo;s portfolio, offering opportunities for further expansion through increased distribution and brand awareness.</p><p>Per the president of Hill&rsquo;s Pet Nutrition, the company is dedicated to enhancing and extending the special bond between people and their pets. With the addition of Prime100, Hill&rsquo;s will expand its portfolio of science-backed, veterinarian-endorsed nutrition products, helping pet owners meet their pets&rsquo; specific dietary needs. There is excitement about collaborating with the Prime100 team, with confidence that the combined expertise will lead to innovations, support veterinarians and provide more tailored nutritional solutions for pets.</p><p>Beyond immediate financial returns, the acquisition provides Hill&rsquo;s with valuable expertise in fresh pet food manufacturing and distribution, which are the key capabilities as the industry shifts toward fresher, less processed options. This knowledge could support future expansion into other high-growth markets where demand for fresh pet food continues to rise.</p><h2>What&rsquo;s More</h2><p>Colgate, a U.S.-based multinational consumer goods company, continues to execute its strategy of delivering both core and premium innovations, increasing advertising investments and expanding its capabilities to strengthen brand presence and drive household penetration. It remains committed to premiumizing its Oral Care portfolio through major innovations, with products like CO. by Colgate, Colgate Elixir toothpaste and Colgate enzyme whitening toothpaste performing well.</p><p>Strong pricing strategies and productivity initiatives have contributed to Colgate&rsquo;s growth, with the company implementing aggressive price increases over the past few quarters, leading to improved margins in fourth-quarter 2024. During the quarter, pricing rose 1.8% year over year, supported by positive pricing trends across several divisions.</p><p>Additionally, Colgate continues to invest in scaling key capabilities in digital, data and analytics to enhance its competitive edge and drive profitability.<br />However, CL has been witnessing inflationary pressures and a challenging macroeconomic environment for quite some time now. Foreign currency fluctuations are also acting as headwinds. The sales view for 2025 includes a mid-single-digit negative impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates.<br /><br />Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 8.4% in the past three months compared with the industry&rsquo;s decline of 5%.</p><h2>CL Stock&#39;s Price Performance in the Past Three Months</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/52/94481.jpg?v=250416254" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Three Picks You Can&#39;t Miss</h2><p><strong>United Natural Foods, Inc.</strong> UNFI currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). UNFI delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 553.1%, on average. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong><br /><br />The consensus estimate for United Natural&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 sales and earnings indicates growth of 0.3% and 442.9%, respectively, from the year-ago period&rsquo;s reported figure.<br /><br /><strong>TreeHouse Foods </strong>THS, a private brand snacks and beverages company, presently holds a Zacks Rank #2. THS delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 17.8%, on average.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TreeHouse Foods&rsquo; 2025 sales and earnings implies growth of 1.6% and 16.7%, respectively, from the year-ago period&rsquo;s reported figure.<br /><br /><strong>US Foods Holding</strong> USFD, which engages in the marketing, sale and distribution of fresh, frozen, and dry food and non-food products, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. USFD delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.4% in the last reported quarter.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for US Foods&rsquo; 2025 sales and earnings calls for growth of 5.3% and 20.9%, respectively, from the prior-year reported levels.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418005/cl-set-to-expand-hill-s-pet-nutrition-with-the-prime100-acquisition?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_corporate_actions-2418005">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.</strong> EL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the March 21, 2025 $45.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What is Implied Volatility?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What do the Analysts Think?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Estee Lauder shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Estee Lauder is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Cosmetics industry that ranks in the Top 36% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while 10 analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 63 cents per share to 32 cents in that period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the way analysts feel about Estee Lauder right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Looking to Trade Options?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Click to see the trades now &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2418006/implied-volatility-surging-for-estee-lauder-el-stock-options?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|options-2418006">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 4 Electric Power Stocks to Consider Amid Industry Weaknesses ]]>

<![CDATA[ The Zacks Utility &ndash; Electric Power industry players generate and supply electricity to millions of customers across the United States. The utilities have been transitioning toward clean sources of fuel and focusing on carbon emissions reduction. The support from the government is aiding the industry&rsquo;s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid and transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly to customers affected by storms.<br /><br /><strong>Vistra Corp</strong>. VST, with its expanding clean power generation portfolio and customer base, renewable operations, and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio are <strong>Exelon Corporation (</strong>EXC),&nbsp; <strong>Entergy Corporation </strong>ETR and <strong>Ameren Corporation </strong>AEE.<br /><br /><p><b>About the Electric Power Industry</b></p><p>The Utility &ndash; Electric Power industry involves the generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A major portion of utilities&rsquo; earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation, demand for the services provided by utilities remains steady, regardless of economic cycles. A very hot summer and cold winter season increases demand for electricity. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals. The increasing usage of the Internet globally and an expected increase in artificial intelligence (AI) in the future will create a rise in demand for electricity. AI-based queries need substantially higher power than traditional Internet searches, music and photos. The declining interest rate is a tailwind for capital-intensive utilities.</p><p><b>3 Electric Power Industry Trends in Focus</b></p><p><strong><em>Interest Rate Decline is a Tailwind</em></strong>: To maintain, upgrade and expand operations, utilities approach capital markets for loans. Multiple rate hikes by the Federal Reserve took the benchmark rate to the 5.25-5.50% range, adversely impacting utility operators. The U.S. Federal Reserve has finally lowered the benchmark rate, with three rate cuts lowering the existing rates by 100 basis points and bringing down rates to a range of 4.25-4.50%. Capital-intensive domestic-focused utilities will benefit from the Fed&rsquo;s decision to reduce interest rates. The drop in interest rates is a big positive for utility operators planning large investments in infrastructure upgrades.<br /><br /><strong><em>Transition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power</em></strong>: The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 23% in 2024 to 25% in 2025 and touch 27% in 2026 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act should support and accelerate the utilities&rsquo; transition toward clean energy sources. It has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for the use of renewable sources. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.<br /><br /><strong><em>Rising Demand and Price for Electricity</em></strong>: Per EIA, electricity supply volumes in the United States will increase by 2% in 2025 from the 2024 level and further increase by 1% in 2026. A major portion of the electricity will be generated from clean energy sources. The development of large data centers in the United States is also increasing the electricity demand. Data centers consumed 4.4% of the U.S. electricity generation in 2023. Per the U.S. Department of Energy release, data centers will consume between 6.7% and 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028. EIA predicts the price of electricity to U.S. residential customers in 2025 to average 16.94 cents per kWh, about 2.7% higher than the 2024 level and increase further in 2026 by 3.4% from the 2025 levels. Rates are also predicted to increase for industrial and commercial customers. The increase in electricity prices in the near term should favor the utilities.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak Prospects</b></p><p>The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates weak near-term prospects. The 59-stock Utility-Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #146, which places it in the bottom 41% of more than 249 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.<br /><br />The industry&rsquo;s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.<br /><br />Before we present a few Utility - Electric Power stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let&rsquo;s take a look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock-market performance and current valuation.</p><p><b>Electric Power Industry Lags S&P 500 but Beats Sector</b></p><p>The Utility Electric Power industry has lagged the Zacks S&amp;P 500 but outperformed its sector over the past 12 months. The industry has gained 21.6% compared with its sector&rsquo;s 15.7% rally. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has gained 24.2% in the same period.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price Performance (One year)</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/industry price performance one year.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 315px;" /></p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</h2><p><b>Electric Power Industry Trading at a Discount</b></p><p>On the basis of EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) TTM, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing Utility Electric Power companies, the industry is trading at 14.01X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 17.7X and the Utility sector&rsquo;s 14.19X.<br /><br />Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.28X and as low as 10.99X, with the median being 15.38X.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Industry EV/EBITDA TTM vs S&amp;P 500 (5yrs)</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/valution s&amp;p 500.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 313px;" /></p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Industry EV/EBITDA TTM vs Sector (5yrs)<br /><br /><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/valution sector.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 313px;" /><br />&nbsp;</h2><p><b>Electric Power Industry Stocks to Add for Better Returns</b></p><p>Utilities is a mature sector, and all the stocks selected from the Zacks Utility Electric Power industry have a market capitalization of more than $20 billion. The stocks currently have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each and have long-term capital investment plans, so a rate decline will definitely help these utilities. All stocks have returned better than the industry in the past 12 months. <span style="pd4ml-display: none; pd4ml-visibility: hidden;"> You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price Performance (one year)</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/price performance utilities one year.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 315px;" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Vistra Corp</strong>.: Irving, TX-based Vistra, together with its subsidiaries, operates as an integrated retail electricity and power generation company. The company&rsquo;s systematic capital investment plans and expanding customer base should further drive its performance. It expects to invest nearly $2.22 billion in 2025. Vistra&rsquo;s integrated business model provides it with a competitive advantage compared with its non-integrated competitors.<br /><br />VST&rsquo;s long-term (term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is pegged at 23.05%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vistra&rsquo;s 2025 earnings per share has implied growth of 0.95% in the last 60 days.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: VST</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/vst price.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 313px;" /></p><p><pd4ml:page.break> </pd4ml:page.break></p><p><strong>Exelon Corporation</strong>: Chicago-based Exelon Corporation focuses on the transmission and distribution of electricity. EXC has plans to invest $38 billion in different projects in the 2025-2028 period. EXC&rsquo;s current dividend yield is 3.55%. Traditionally, demand for electricity is adversely impacted by weather fluctuation and lower usage by customers. To offset the loss of revenues due to lower customer usage, nearly 78% of Exelon&rsquo;s distribution revenues are decoupled. Decoupling insulates the top line from load fluctuations and leads to stable earnings,<br /><br />EXC&rsquo;s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 5.71%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Exelon&rsquo;s 2025 earnings per share indicates growth of 0.4% in the last 60 days.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: EXC</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/exc price.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 313px;" /></p><p><strong>Entergy Corporation</strong>: New Orleans, LA-based Entergy Corporation is primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power. It expects capital deployment of nearly $37 billion in different projects from 2025 to 2028. These investments will mainly help the company deliver energy efficiently, improve customers&rsquo; experiences and provide environmental and cost-efficiency benefits to its customers.<br /><br />ETR&rsquo;s long-term earnings growth is pegged at 8.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ETR&rsquo;s 2025 earnings is pegged at $4.29 per share, indicating growth of 1.4% in the last 60 days.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: ETR</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/etr price.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 313px;" /></p><p><pd4ml:page.break> </pd4ml:page.break></p><p><strong>Ameren Corporation:</strong> St. Louis, MO-based Ameren Corporation, incorporated in December 1997, is a utility company that generates and distributes electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale end markets in Missouri and Illinois. It expects capital deployment in excess of $26.3 billion in different projects from 2025 to 2029. Ameren&rsquo;s growth has been led by its systematic and consistent investments in growth projects and infrastructural upgrades.<br /><br />AEE&rsquo;s long-term earnings growth is pegged at 6.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AEE&rsquo;s 2025 earnings is pegged at $4.93 per share, indicating growth of 0.2% in the last 90 days.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: AEE</h2><h2 style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/aee price.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 315px;" /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</h2><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417878/4-electric-power-stocks-to-consider-amid-industry-weaknesses?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-industry_outlook-2417878">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqD0GSVjRN0?rel=0" width="560"></iframe><p><strong>NVIDIA Corporation (</strong>NVDA<strong>) </strong>is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU.&nbsp;NVIDIA is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high performance and accelerated computing. The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partner across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds. Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVIDIA&rsquo;s revenues to witness a CAGR of 50.5% through fiscal 2025-2027. &nbsp;NVIDIA boasts a sturdy cash-flow generating ability. The company&rsquo;s accelerated revenue growth along with improving operating efficiency is bringing in higher cash flows. NVIDIA is a cash rich company with a strong balance sheet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(EV) maker </strong><strong>Tesla (</strong>TSLA<strong>)</strong> has evolved into a dynamic technology innovator.&nbsp;Tesla&rsquo;s EV business is under pressure from pricing challenges and fierce competition, with 2024 marking its first-ever annual delivery decline. However, its long-term growth story remains strong, fueled by its booming Energy Generation &amp; Storage segment, expansive Supercharger network, and AI advancements. Energy deployments doubled in 2024, driven by strong demand for Megapack and Powerwall, and this momentum is expected to continue. Tesla is also making strides in autonomous driving, with plans to launch robotaxi services this year. Musk&rsquo;s leadership in Trump&rsquo;s Department of Government Efficiency could help streamline AV regulations, benefiting Tesla&rsquo;s rollout. Backed by a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, Tesla is well-positioned for continued innovation and expansion. We remain bullish on the stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417569/top-stock-picks-for-week-of-february-17-2025?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-video_blog-2417569">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>The Travelers Companies, Inc.</strong> TRV shares lost 3.4% in a month, underperforming the industry, the Finance sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index in the same time frame.<br /><br />TRV, one of the leading writers of auto and homeowners&rsquo; insurance plus commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance, has a market capitalization of $54 billion. The average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 1.3 million.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">TRV vs. Industry, Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500 in a Month</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a1/94475.jpg?v=1065134539" style="height: 200px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The shares are trading at a premium to the industry. Its price-to-book value of 1.94X is higher than the industry average of 1.63X.<br />&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3e/94479.jpg?v=805976120" style="height: 200px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Shares of other insurers like <strong>The Allstate Corporation </strong>ALL, <strong>Chubb Limited </strong>CB and <strong>The Progressive Corporation </strong>PGR are also trading at a multiple higher than the industry average.<br /><br />TRV shares are trading below the 14-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend. The 14-day SMA is a key indicator for traders and analysts to identify support and resistance levels. It is considered particularly important as it is the first marker of an uptrend or downtrend.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">TRV Trading Below 50-Day Moving Average</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/25/94480.jpg?v=93741462" style="height: 200px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Travelers&rsquo; Favorable Return on Capital</h2><p>Return on equity (ROE) for the trailing 12 months was 19.1%, comparing favorably with the industry&rsquo;s 7.6%. This reflects its efficiency in utilizing shareholders&rsquo; funds.&nbsp; Sustained operational excellence helped generate double-digit core ROE in nine out of the last 10 years. Travelers aims to generate mid-teens core ROE over time.<br />&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/08/94477.jpg?v=1490045744" style="height: 200px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Also, return on invested capital (ROIC) has been increasing over the last few quarters, with the company raising its capital investment over the same time frame. This reflects TRV&rsquo;s efficiency in utilizing funds to generate income. ROIC in the trailing 12 months was 10.9%, better than the industry average of 5.8%.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6f/94478.jpg?v=96449522" style="height: 200px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Mixed Analyst Sentiment on TRV</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has moved down 15.4% since it reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings, while the same for 2026 has moved up 4.3% in the same time frame.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/46/94488.jpg?v=1793383979" style="height: 200px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings stands at $17.56, suggesting a decrease of 18.6% despite 7.4% higher revenues of $49.9 billion. The consensus estimate for 2026 earnings stands at $23.09, suggesting an increase of 31.5% on 6.1% higher revenues of $52.9 billion.<br /><br />The long-term earnings growth rate is expected to be 11.2%, better than the industry average of 9.2%.</p><h2>Factors Impacting Travelers</h2><p>Travelers&rsquo; solid retention, better pricing, increased new business and positive renewal premium change poise it well for growth. The insurer&rsquo;s compelling product portfolio consists of coverages across nine lines of business.<br /><br />A solid auto and homeowners business, as well as commercial businesses, banking on the successful execution of growth strategies and stability in the markets where it operates, is set to drive the company&rsquo;s lines of business.<br /><br />Higher returns from the non-fixed income portfolio have been driving investment income over the last four years amid a low-interest rate environment. Travelers estimates fixed-income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, to be $3 billion in 2025, with $710 million in the first quarter of 2025. The metric is expected to grow to approximately $790 million in the fourth quarter. The company hopes that the $100 billion investment portfolio should continue generating a higher level of predictable and reliable net investment income.<br /><br />Travelers has a conservative balance sheet among its peers. The insurer remains focused on keeping the debt-to-capital ratio between 15 and 25 and has been increasing its book value for the past 10 years. TRV had $5.04 billion remaining under repurchase authorization at 2024 end.<br /><br />By its nature of operations, TRV&rsquo;s results are vulnerable to catastrophe loss. The insurer estimates losses stemming from the California wildfire to have a material impact on its first-quarter 2025 earnings.<br /><br />Travelers has been witnessing a rise in expenses over the past many years owing to an increase in claims and claim adjustment expenses as well as general and administrative expenses. The company expects the expense ratio to be around 28.5% in 2025.</p><h2>Average Target Price for TRV Suggests a Solid Upside</h2><p>Based on short-term price targets offered by 22 analysts, the Zacks average price target is $270.73 per share. The average suggests a potential 13.6% upside from Tuesday&rsquo;s closing price.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a0/94476.jpg?v=1053172571" style="height: 200px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Impressive Dividend History</h2><p>Travelers has been hiking dividends for the last 20 years. Its dividend yield of 1.8% appears attractive compared with the industry average of 0.3%, making it an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors.</p><h2>To Conclude</h2><p>Travelers has a strong market presence in auto, homeowners&rsquo; insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth. Strong renewal rate change, retention and increase in new business supported by a compelling portfolio and solid capital position should continue to drive earnings.<br /><br />The company has an impressive VGM Score of B. This style score rates stocks on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth and momentum.<br /><br />However, a premium valuation, price underperformance, a bearish trend and a decline in 2025&#39;s bottom-line projection keep us cautious about this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

<![CDATA[ Here's Why You Should Offload American Axle Stock From Your Portfolio ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>American Axle &amp; Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.</strong> AXL, a leading supplier of driveline and drivetrain systems, modules and components for the light vehicle market, expects declines in North American light vehicle production, massive capital expenditures and high debt level to act as major headwinds.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s see why you should consider offloading this Zacks Ranks #4 (Sell) stock from your portfolio.</p><h2>Lower Expected Vehicle Production to Ail American Axle</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A bleak outlook for 2025 sales clouds AXL&rsquo;s prospects. It expects sales in the range of $5-$6.05 billion compared with $6.12 billion in 2024 due to expected declines in North American light vehicle production.&nbsp;<br /><br />American Axle needs to make massive capital expenditures to develop technologically advanced products to adapt to the changing dynamics of the auto space, which might impact its cash flow. The company expects capital expenditure of $300 million in 2025 compared with $242 million made in 2024.<br /><br />As of Dec. 31, 2024, the company&rsquo;s net long-term debt amounted to $2.58 billion, as compared to cash and cash equivalents of $552.9 million. Its total debt-to-capital ratio stands at 0.81, higher than its industry&#39;s 0.25. Elevated leverage restricts its financial flexibilities to tap onto growth opportunities.<br /><br />AXL relies heavily on GM, Stellantis and Ford. GM accounted for 42% of its 2024 sales, and Stellantis and Ford each contributed 13%. A decline in sales to these automakers or reduced production of supported vehicle programs due to market share losses could significantly impact the company&rsquo;s financial performance.</p><h2>Electrification Strategy &amp; Acquisitions to Aid AXL&rsquo;s Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">American Axle has adopted multiple strategies to stay afloat amid these testing times. It has partnered with Inovance to boost electrification. Recent launches, including eDrive units and EV components, highlight its growth in electric propulsion. While past business quotes focused on electrification, ICE and hybrid applications now dominate. AXL is actively pursuing $1.5 billion in new opportunities. Portfolio optimization efforts, including the Metaldyne acquisition and impending divestiture of its India commercial axle unit, enhance focus. The recent deal to acquire Dowlais is expected to bolster capabilities, drive high-margin growth and improve financial strength, solidifying AXL&rsquo;s leadership in driveline and metal-forming solutions.</p><h2>Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the auto space are <strong>Geely Automobile Holdings Limited</strong> GELYY, <strong>Dana Incorporated</strong> DAN and <strong>Garrett Motion Inc. </strong>GTX. While GELYY &amp; DAN sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, GTX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GELYY&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 sales and earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 66.62% and 149.31%, respectively. EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 and 2026 have improved by 15 cents and 38 cents, respectively, in the past 60 days.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DAN&rsquo;s 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 79.17%. EPS estimates for 2025 have improved by 20 cents in the past 30 days.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GTX&rsquo;s 2025 sales and earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 2.16% and 17.92%, respectively. EPS estimates for 2025 have improved by a penny in the past 30 days.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417975/here-s-why-you-should-offload-american-axle-stock-from-your-portfolio?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2417975">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ ETFs to Watch as Walmart Looks Poised to Beat on Q4 Earnings ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>The world&#39;s largest brick-and-mortar retailer &mdash; Walmart WMT &mdash; is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Feb. 20, before market open. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at its fundamentals ahead of the earnings release.<br /><br />Walmart has gained 23.4% over the past three months, outperforming the Zacks industry average growth of 15.1%. The outperformance is likely to continue given that Walmart has higher chances of beating earnings estimates (read: Retail ETFs in Focus Ahead of Big-Box Q4 Earnings).&nbsp;<br /><br />This has put ETFs having a substantial allocation to the retailer like <strong>Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund </strong>XLP, <strong>Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF </strong>VDC, <strong>Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF</strong> FSTA, <strong>VanEck Vectors Retail ETF</strong> RTH and <strong>iShares Evolved U.S. Discretionary Spending ETF</strong> IEDI in focus ahead of its quarterly earnings.</p><h2>Earnings Whispers</h2><p>Walmart has an Earnings ESP of +2.15% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.&nbsp;<br /><br />The retailer saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth quarter indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 6.7% in earnings and 3.3% in revenues. The company&rsquo;s earnings track record is robust. It delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 9.25%.</p><h2>Strong Growth Trends</h2><p>Walmart relies more on groceries and essential products, which tend to maintain stable demand throughout economic cycles. Its value-driven approach and well-executed digital strategy have helped the retailer capture more grocery market share, particularly by attracting higher-income households.<br /><br />Despite this shift, Walmart still has significant exposure to lower-income consumers, many of whom remain under financial strain due to persistent inflation. However, the company has successfully offset this weakness by drawing in more affluent shoppers through its efficient digital offerings.<br /><br />Beyond attracting higher-income consumers, Walmart&rsquo;s expanding e-commerce business is also unlocking new revenue streams. Its digital platform supports higher-margin opportunities such as advertising and third-party fulfillment, further strengthening its long-term growth prospects.</p><h2>Analysts Are Bullish Ahead of Earnings</h2><p>Analysts are bullish on Walmart, with an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.25 made by 38 brokerage firms. Out of them, 31 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 81.58% and 10.53% of all recommendations. The average price target for Walmart comes to $103.11, ranging from a low of $80.00 to a high of $120.00.<br /><br />Several analysts have lifted their price target on Walmart ahead of earnings, citing expectations of market share gains and outperformance. Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank analysts each recently lifted their price target to $115, while analysts from JPMorgan and Bank of America lifted their targets to $112 and $120, respectively.<br /><br />On its last earnings call, the mega-retailer lifted its fiscal 2025 guidance. It expects revenues to increase 4.8-5.1% compared with the previously mentioned 3.75-4.75% rise. The company anticipates earnings per share of $2.42-$2.47, up from the prior stated $2.35-$2.43.&nbsp;</p><h2>ETFs to Watch</h2><p><strong>Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP)</strong><br /><br />Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund targets the broad consumer staples space and follows the Consumer Staples Select Sector Index. It holds about 38 securities in its basket, with Walmart taking the second spot at 10.8%. XLP has the largest allocation in consumer staples distribution &amp; retail at 32.6%, while household products, beverages, and food products account for a double-digit allocation each. Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund is the most popular consumer staples ETF with AUM of $17 billion and an average daily volume of 9 million shares. XLP charges 8 bps in fees per year and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (read: 4 Safe ETFs to Play as Tariff Tensions Heat Up).<br /><br /><strong>Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC)</strong><br /><br />Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF also targets the broad consumer staples space by tracking the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 25/50 Index. It holds 103 stocks in its basket, with Walmart occupying the second position, with a 13.6% allocation. Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF manages a $7.4 billion asset base and charges a fee of 9 bps per year. VDC trades in a good average volume of around 108,000 shares per day and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.<br /><br /><strong>Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (FSTA)</strong><br /><br />Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF offers broad exposure to the consumer staples sector by tracking the MSCI USA IMI Consumer Staples Index and holds 105 stocks in its basket. Of these, Walmart takes the top spot with a 13.5% share. Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF has amassed $1.3 billion in its asset base while trading in a good volume of around 119,000 shares a day, on average. FSTA charges 8 bps in annual fees from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook (see: all Consumer Staples ETFs here).<br /><br /><strong>VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH)</strong><br /><br />VanEck Vectors Retail ETF provides exposure to the 26 largest retail firms by tracking the MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index, which measures the performance of the companies involved in retail distribution, wholesalers, online, direct mail and TV retailers, multi-line retailers, specialty retailers and food and other staples retailers. Walmart takes the second spot with a 9.4% share. VanEck Vectors Retail ETF has amassed $242.3 million in its asset base and charges 35 bps in annual fees. It trades in a lower volume of 5,000 shares a day on average. VanEck Vectors Retail ETF has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.<br /><br /><strong>iShares U.S. Consumer Focused ETF (IEDI)</strong><br /><br />iShares U.S. Consumer Focused ETF is an actively managed ETF that provides exposure to U.S. companies with a focus on consumer spending and consumer goods. It holds 178 stocks in its basket, with Walmart occupying the fourth position at 8.7% share. iShares U.S. Consumer Focused ETF has accumulated $34.4 million in its asset base and charges 18 bps in fees per year. Volume is paltry for IEDI as it exchanges 6,000 shares a day, on average.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417973/etfs-to-watch-as-walmart-looks-poised-to-beat-on-q4-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2417973">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fluor Corporation</strong> FLR shares dipped 8.4% during yesterday&rsquo;s trading session, post the earnings release. Investors&rsquo; sentiments got hurt after it reported lower-than-expected results for fourth-quarter 2024.<br /><br /><strong><em>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.</em></strong><br /><br />Earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined from the prior year, due to a sharp drop in Urban Solutions&#39; margin despite higher revenues. Revenues also missed the consensus mark but increased from the previous year. The top line of the company grew year over year on the back of solid contributions from the Urban Solutions and Energy Solutions business segments.<br /><br />Fluor&rsquo;s 2024 performance highlights the impact of its four-year strategy focused on expanding a reimbursable backlog, strengthening capital structure and improving project execution.

You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated </strong>LEG reported fourth-quarter 2024 results, with earnings meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues beating the same. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics declined.<br /><br />The quarterly results indicated weak demand in the company&rsquo;s residential end markets, due to a challenging macro environment and soft consumer spending. Softening in Automotive and Hydraulic Cylinders further impacted its performance. Although LEG carried out its restructuring and operating efficiency improvement initiatives, the headwinds mentioned above overshadowed the prospects to a great extent.<br /><br /><strong>Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.</strong> MLM reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2024, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. Both top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis.<br /><br />Despite challenges in 2024, such as bad weather, reduced construction demand and tighter monetary policies, the company still achieved earnings growth and recorded profits in the fourth quarter. This was driven by $6 billion in strategic acquisitions and divestitures, reshaping the portfolio to focus more on aggregates, improving margins and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Looking ahead, MLM is confident that strong infrastructure and data center demand will help meet its 2025 adjusted EBITDA target of $2.25 billion.<br /><br /><strong>Masco Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s MAS fourth-quarter 2024 earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Earnings topped expectations in six of the trailing seven quarters. On the other hand, net sales missed the consensus mark and tumbled year over year.<br /><br />The quarter&rsquo;s top-line results reflected lower sales volume for North America&rsquo;s plumbing products, lower net selling prices of decorative architectural products and an unfavorable sales mix of plumbing products. However, the bottom line was favored by lower selling, general and administrative expenses, favorable net selling prices and strategic cost savings initiatives. Moving into 2025, the company aims to continue maintaining shareholder value through its top-tier repair and remodel-oriented product portfolio, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417957/fluor-stock-down-on-q4-earnings-revenues-miss-backlog-falls-y-y?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2417957">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ ABG to Acquire Herb Chambers: Is the Stock Worth Buying Now? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Asbury Automotive Group</strong> ABG has inked a deal to acquire several automotive dealerships from The Herb Chambers Companies, one of the largest private dealership groups in the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The deal includes 33 dealerships, 52 car franchises and three repair centers. The sale is expected to be completed by late second quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. Asbury will finance the $1.34 billion acquisition via a mix of loans, mortgage funds and cash.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This acquisition will significantly expand ABG&rsquo;s presence in the New England market, strengthen its position as a leading auto retailer in the United States, and is also likely to boost the company&rsquo;s top-line growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the trailing 12-month period, ABG shares have surged 38.7%, outperforming the Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector&rsquo;s appreciation of 31% and the Zacks Automotive &ndash; Retail and Whole Sales industry&rsquo;s return of 23.3%. The S&amp;P 500 index has gained 23.5% in the same time frame.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Asbury shares have also outperformed industry peers like <strong>AutoNation</strong> AN, <strong>Rush Enterprises</strong> RUSHA and <strong>America&rsquo;s CarMart </strong>CRMT in the trailing 12-month period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While AN and RUSHA shares have surged 35.4% and 30.8%, respectively, CRMT shares have plunged 20.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ABG&rsquo;s exceptional performance can be attributed to its strong new vehicle sales, solid Parts &amp; Service growth and rapid digital and technological advancements.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One Year Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9c/94458.jpg?v=737801010" style="height: 270px; width: 620px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">So is this the right time for investors to start accumulating the stock? Let us dig deep to find out.</p><h2>Robust Sales Growth Bodes Well for Asbury</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ABG is benefiting from solid growth in its new vehicle sales and profitability. In the fourth quarter of 2024, same-store new vehicle sales increased 7% year over year and 12% sequentially, with strong demand for its luxury brands as well as Hyundai, Kia, General Motors and Ford. The average new vehicle gross profit per unit was $3,661, helping sustain overall profitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Asbury&rsquo;s Parts &amp; Service segment has been delivering impressive results, with same-store gross profit rising 11% and the high-margin Customer Pay segment up 13% in the fourth quarter of 2024. This segment provides recurring revenues to ABG, making the business more resilient.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ABG&rsquo;s Clicklane is allowing the company to differentiate itself by selling both new and used vehicles online. It has been seeing rapid growth, with 51,000 units sold in 2024, a 13% increase from 2023.</p><h2>ABG Shares Undervalued</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Asbury&rsquo;s shares are undervalued, as suggested by the Value Score of A. In terms of the forward 12-month price/sales, the stock is currently trading at 0.34x, lower than the broader sector&rsquo;s 1.68x.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price/Sales Ratio (F12M)</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/05/94451.jpg?v=1921620918" style="height: 196px; width: 620px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock is trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">ABG Shares Trade Above 50-Day &amp; 200-Day SMA</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/83/94452.jpg?v=1893297840" style="height: 245px; width: 620px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Key Headwinds for Asbury</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the strong performance, ABG is facing several challenges that are likely to pressure its stock. Inventory constraints, especially in the used vehicle segment, remain a concern. The company expects supply challenges to continue throughout 2025, limiting volume growth. The rising new vehicle incentives are also creating downward pressure on used vehicle pricing and are likely to reduce ABG&rsquo;s margins.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Macroeconomic risks, including interest rate fluctuations, tariff hikes and consumer demand uncertainty, are also posing challenges for Asbury. The huge planned capital expenditures for 2025 and 2026 can limit ABG&rsquo;s short-term flexibility and weigh on investor sentiment.</p><h2>ABG&rsquo;s 2025 Earnings Estimates Trend Downward</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ABG&rsquo;s first-quarter 2025 revenues is pegged at $4.3 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 2.44%. The consensus mark for first-quarter EPS is currently pegged at $6.76, down 4.1% over the past 30 days and indicating a decline of 6.24% on a year-over-year basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ABG&rsquo;s full-year 2025 revenues is pegged at $17.21 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 0.13%. The consensus mark for 2025 EPS is currently pegged at $26.80, down 0.7% over the past 30 days and indicating a decline of 1.62% on a year-over-year basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Asbury beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in just one of the trailing four quarters and missed thrice, the average negative surprise being 1.17%.</p><h2>What Should Investors Do With ABG Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">While Asbury&rsquo;s acquisition of The Herb Chambers Companies and strong sales are making the company poised for long-term growth, its ongoing inventory constraints and macroeconomic risks may create headwinds for the stock in the near term.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ABG currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point to accumulate the stock. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417956/abg-to-acquire-herb-chambers-is-the-stock-worth-buying-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_corporate_actions-2417956">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Economic &amp; Earnings Commentary</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">New data on the housing market is out this morning ahead of the opening bell, further illustrating a profounds cooling down in this industry. We also see a slew of new quarterly earnings this morning, most of which are beating expectations but lowering guidance. Thus, we see the Dow -125 points at this hour, the S&amp;P 500 is -15 and the Nasdaq -40.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Housing Starts, Building Permits Mixed in January</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">New <strong>Housing Starts</strong> last month were notably lower than the previous month: January&rsquo;s tally of 1.37 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units was slightly below the 1.4 million expected, but more than 100K under December&rsquo;s 1.51 million. Single-family starts &mdash; where the big profits are made in this industry &mdash; were down -8.4% month over month. Multi-family levels were also lower, but not as drastically.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Building Permits</strong> reached 1.48 million for the month, in-line with December&rsquo;s total and now three-straight months at 1.48 million or higher. This morning&rsquo;s headline was higher than the 1.46 million analysts were looking for. Permits are seen as a proxy for future housing starts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">That said, with mortgage rates moving from +7% to +7.25% last month, the appetite for new housing is suffering. We saw yesterday in the NAHB homebuilders survey that confidence in the industry dropped -5% to a 5-month low. Even being at the foothills of the spring homebuilding season, we remain concerned that prospective homebuyers will remain on the sidelines &mdash; either until rates start coming down or at least some clarity to the future economy starts to appear.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Quarterly Earnings Roundup: ETSY, GRMN, JLL</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Etsy </strong>ETSY shares are down -6.7% this morning, after Q4 earnings beat expectations but quarterly sales came in below estimates. Earnings of $1.03 per share outpaced the 95 cents in the Zacks consensus by +8.4%, while revenues of $852.2 million missed the $861.7 million analysts were projecting. Shares are giving back most of their +8.3% gains made year to date.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GPS products provider <strong>Garmin</strong> GRMN reported outperformance on both top and bottom lines in its Q4 report before today&rsquo;s opening bell: earnings of $2.41 per share came in +24% higher than the anticipated $1.89, and even more than the year-ago&rsquo;s reported $1.72 per share. Revenues of $1.82 billion surged beyond the consensus $1.68 billion, and shares are +10% in today&rsquo;s pre-market on the news.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago-based retail management corporation <strong>Jones Lang LaSalle</strong> JLL outpaced expectations this morning, with earnings of $6.15 per share easily ahead of the $5.79 expected, with revenues of $6.81 billion bettering the $6.48 billion analysts were looking for. Higher transactional growth led the way in the quarter. Shares initially spike on the news, but have come back down to yesterday&rsquo;s close. Shares are up +11.4% year to date.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What to Expect from the Stock Market Today</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest news we&rsquo;re anticipating before the closing bell today is the release of the <strong>Fed meeting minutes</strong> from last month, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) predictably kept interest rates steady at +4.25-4.50%. Based on data and opinion we&rsquo;ve seen lately, we don&rsquo;t expect this to change any time in the near future. Thus, we may seek nuances in the notes today, but feel we are unlikely to be surprised by any particulars.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417955/market-awaits-fed-meeting-minutes?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-economic_highlights-2417955">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ SMTC Stock Plunges 51% in a Month: Hold Tight or Time to Let Go? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Semtech Corporation</strong> SMTC has plummeted 50.6% in the past month, underperforming the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry&rsquo;s decline of 1.5%, Zacks Computer and Technology sector&rsquo;s return of 1.7% and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s appreciation of 1.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Semtech stock has been witnessing a decline following the company&#39;s announcement that net sales of its CopperEdge products are expected to fall below the prior floor estimate of $50 million for fiscal 2026. The downward revision of sales figures is attributed to a change in server rack architecture following unfavorable feedback from NVIDIA, which is SMTC&rsquo;s key customer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In response to this unexpected forecast, several law firms have filed lawsuits against SMTC suspecting a potential securities law breach by Semtech. The culmination of these events caused investors to panic, sending SMTC stock down.</p><h3>One-month Price Return Performance</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/62/94462.jpg?v=427724632" style="height: 383px; width: 620px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>SMTC Faces Economic and Competitive Challenges</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The recent geopolitical tensions pose a substantial threat to Semtech&rsquo;s revenue streams. China and Hong Kong accounted for 32% of SMTC&rsquo;s total revenues in 2024, making this region its highest contributor. However, emerging geopolitical uncertainty, regulatory hurdles and tariffs have the potential to affect future growth in China.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SMTC also faces stiff competition from other semiconductor companies that produce comparable products. SMTC&rsquo;s passive optical network (PON) products compete with those of <strong>Broadcom</strong>&rsquo;s AVGO. In the IoT &amp; Wireless Solutions market, companies like <strong>STMicroelectronics </strong>STM and <strong>ON Semiconductor </strong>ON offer comparable products to those developed by Semtech.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Broadcom produces a range of PONs, including BCM68660 and BCM55050, that are comparable to Semtech&#39;s 50G HS-PON Chipset. Both SMTC and AVGO have PONs dedicated to 10G optical network markets too. ON Semiconductor and STMicroelectronics develop LoRaWAN, power management and transient voltage suppression devices comparable to those of Semtech.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The competition, intensified by these players, gives customers greater leverage in negotiating better pricing, which impacts Semtech&rsquo;s sales volume and compresses its profit margins. Additionally, this competitive pressure limits Semtech&rsquo;s ability to scale its business effectively.</p><h2>Technical Indicator Signals Further Downtrend for SMTC Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Adding to investors&rsquo; pessimism, Semtech shares are trading below the 50-day moving average, a technical indicator often seen as a bearish signal. This movement suggests a potential continuation of the downward trend.</p><h3>SMTC 50-Day Moving Average Chart</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1b/94463.jpg?v=330505385" style="height: 325px; width: 620px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Growing Demand for IoT and AI Keeps SMTC Afloat</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite near-term challenges, SMTC&#39;s commitment to innovation is evident in its continued investment in advanced design solutions and next-generation technologies that position the company to capitalize on emerging trends, such as AI, cloud computing and smart infrastructure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, Semtech&rsquo;s solid pipeline of products and strategic focus on high-demand markets like AI and IoT ensure a sustainable growth trajectory. Semtech&rsquo;s IoT revenues also demonstrated resilience, growing 11% sequentially in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Semtech is gaining from the growing adoption of its LoRa technology and LoRaWAN standards, which enable efficient, long-range and low-power wireless connectivity for a range of industrial applications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">During the last earnings call, management highlighted strong bookings and backlog for IoT solutions, boosting its momentum across end markets, such as smart cities, agriculture and logistics. For Semtech, this segment remains a crucial growth driver as IoT adoption advances globally.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 reflects this optimism, with revenues expected to grow 4.3% and 18.47%, respectively.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Motorola Solutions, Inc. </strong>MSI recently announced that it has received the highest-level security authorization from the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for its federal cloud offering. With the FedRAMP High Authorization, federal agencies, as well as state and local agencies, will be able to deploy Motorola&rsquo;s purpose-built cloud technologies with confidence to meet the highest government standards for managing sensitive, unclassified data.<br /><br />The authorized technologies include Motorola&rsquo;s state-of-the-art APX-series radios, which combine mission-critical Project 25 radio communications with broadband capabilities. The solution boasts high-power speakers, HDR mics, advanced background noise suppression and windporting technology that minimizes noise from wind, crowds and sirens. These radios are designed to extend coverage, enhance situational awareness, and reduce the time and resources required to manage and update radio fleets.&nbsp;<br /><br />The cloud-hosted APX radio applications provide advanced features, such as SmartConnect, which enables seamless switching between land mobile radio and broadband networks, ensuring uninterrupted voice communication. SmartLocate enhances safety by offering real-time location and status updates for officers in the field, while RadioCentral and SmartProgramming allow secure, remote updates to radios, eliminating downtime typically associated with returning radios to the station. &nbsp;<br /><br />These solutions will be integrated with the CommandCentral Aware cloud software that aggregates real-time data and video into a unified, secure operational view, automating data analysis to provide critical insights and inform responders in the field.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Will This Deployment Drive MSI&rsquo;s Share Performance?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As a leading provider of mission-critical communication products and services worldwide, Motorola has ensured a steady revenue stream from this niche market.

It witnessed a healthy demand for video security products and services during the fourth quarter of 2024 and remains well-poised to maintain this growth momentum with a diversified portfolio.<br /><br />This FedRAMP High Authorization is a significant milestone for Motorola, positioning the company as a trusted partner for federal and government agencies. The achievement not only reinforces the company&#39;s commitment to providing secure, scalable, and resilient communication solutions but also expands its market opportunities.&nbsp;<br /><br />All these advancements are expected to generate incremental demand for Motorola&rsquo;s solutions, leading to higher revenues. An improved financial performance is likely to propel the stock upward.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MSI&rsquo;s Stock Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Motorola have gained 35.6% over the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 28.4%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c8/94465.jpg?v=435009243" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MSI&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Motorola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).&nbsp;<br /><br />Some better-ranked stocks in the broader industry have been discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Keysight Technologies, Inc.</strong> KEYS carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Consolidated Edison, Inc.</strong> ED is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 20, after market close.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em><br /><br />Consolidated Edison delivered an earnings surprise of 7.69% in the last reported quarter. The company also holds a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 7.69%.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s discuss the factors that are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.</p><h2>Factors to Note Ahead of ED&rsquo;s Q4 Earnings</h2><p>Consolidated Edison&rsquo;s service territories witnessed above-normal weather patterns for the majority of the fourth quarter. This is likely to have hurt electricity demand from its customers for heating purposes this winter, affecting the company&rsquo;s top-line performance.<br /><br />Adverse weather patterns, including snowfall and storms, affected some parts of ED&rsquo;s service territories during the fourth quarter. This is expected to have disrupted the company&rsquo;s services in those areas and resulted in outages for its customers. ED&rsquo;s overall revenues are likely to have been impacted due to these outages.<br /><br />However, increased revenues from favorable electric rates and gas rate plans must have bolstered the company&rsquo;s quarterly top-line performance.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ED&rsquo;s fourth-quarter sales is pinned at $3.58 billion, which suggests an increase of 3.9% from the year-ago reported number.<br /><br />The aforementioned adverse weather patterns are likely to have damaged ED&rsquo;s utility infrastructure. This is likely to have pushed up the company&rsquo;s operating expenses for repair and restoration of its damaged infrastructure, which, in turn, is expected to have hurt its bottom-line performance to some extent.<br /><br />Nevertheless, solid sales expectations might have contributed favorably to ED&rsquo;s quarterly earnings to some extent.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Consolidated Edison&rsquo;s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 97 cents per share, which implies a decrease of 3% from the year-ago reported number.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Consolidated Edison Inc Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Consolidated Edison Inc Price and EPS Surprise" height="320" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/21/1739971779.png" title="" width="620" /> <p>Consolidated Edison Inc price-eps-surprise | Consolidated Edison Inc Quote</p></div><h2>What the Zacks Model Unveils for ED</h2><p>Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for ED this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here, as you will see below.<br /><br /><strong>ED&rsquo;s Earnings ESP</strong>: ED has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br /><strong>ED&rsquo;s Zacks Rank</strong>: Consolidated Edison currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Another Stock to Consider</h2><p>Investors can consider the following player from the same industry, which also has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their quarterly results.<br /><br /><strong>CenterPoint Energy, Inc.</strong> CNP is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 20, before market open. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.63% and a Zacks Rank of 2 at present.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $2.28 billion, which indicates a 4.6% improvement from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s figure. The consensus estimate for earnings is pinned at 40 cents per share, which indicates year-over-year growth of 25%.</p><h2>Recent Utility Releases</h2><p><strong>NextEra Energy, Inc. </strong>NEE reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of 53 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents by 3.9%. The company reported operating revenues of $5.38 billion, which lagged the consensus estimate of $6.49 billion by 17%.<br /><br /><strong>WEC Energy Group</strong> WEC reported fourth-quarter 2024 earnings of $1.43 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 by 0.7%. The company reported operating revenues of $2.28 billion, which missed the consensus estimate of $2.6 billion by 12.1%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417945/consolidated-edison-to-post-q4-earnings-what-s-in-the-cards?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2417945">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Watsco's Q4 Earnings & Revenues Beat, HVAC Equipment Sales Up Y/Y ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Watsco, Inc.</strong> WSO reported impressive fourth-quarter 2024 results wherein earnings and revenues topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year.<br /><br /><em><strong>See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</strong></em><br /><br />The quarterly results benefited from a robust sales trend in residential equipment and improved commercial equipment sales. Additionally, the recapture of sales and market share of one of WSO&rsquo;s core OEMs, which faced supply chain inefficiencies in 2023, boded well for the quarter.<br /><br />Although increased costs and expenses were restrictive to some extent, the company&rsquo;s focus on capturing growth opportunities, advanced product offerings and growing top line aided the quarter&rsquo;s bottom line during the fourth quarter.<br /><br />WSO stock jumped 9.7% during the trading hours and gained 2.1% in the after-hours trading session on Tuesday post the earnings announcement. Investors&rsquo; sentiments are likely to have been boosted by the 11% hike in the annual dividend payment, along with favorable growth trends across key metrics.</p><h2>Inside Watsco&rsquo;s Headlines</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reported quarterly earnings per share (EPS) of $2.37, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13 by 11.3%. In the year-ago quarter, WSO reported EPS of $2.06.<br /><br />Revenues of $1.75 billion also topped the consensus mark of $1.65 billion by 6.2% and grew 9% year over year.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Watsco, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Watsco, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/19/1739974164.png" title="" width="579" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Watsco, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Watsco, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Sales of HVAC equipment (heating, ventilating and air conditioning, comprising 69% of net sales) were up 14% year over year. Sales of other HVAC products (27% of sales) remained flat year over year. Sales from commercial refrigeration products (4% of sales) grew 4% from the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />Sales trends of Watsco&rsquo;s residential HVAC equipment reflected new customer acquisition, market share gains, price and mix benefits and accelerated growth in e-commerce sales, highlighting double-digit unit growth year over year.<br /><br />E-commerce sales increased 8% to $2.6 billion in 2024 and accounted for 35% of annual net sales. In the fourth quarter, e-commerce sales were up 16% year over year.<br /><br />In 2024, OnCallAir presented quotes to about 313,000 households, marking a 22% increase from last year. Additionally, it generated $1.5 billion in gross merchandise value, a 25% jump year over year.</p><h2>Operating Highlights of WSO</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The gross margin expanded 90 basis points (bps) in the reported quarter to 26.7%. Our model predicted the gross margin to increase year over year to 26.6%. Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, declined 20 bps to 19.3%. We expected SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of sales, to contract 30 bps year over year.<br /><br />The operating margin expanded 110 bps year over year to 7.8%. Our estimate for the metric was on par with the reported value.</p><h2>Watsco&rsquo;s 2024 Highlights</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For the full year, the company reported net sales of $7.62 billion, up 5% year over year.<br /><br />Gross margin was down year over year to 26.8% from 27.4%. The operating margin also contracted 60 bps to 10.3% from the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />WSO reported full-year EPS of $13.30, which was down from $13.67 reported in 2023.</p><h2>WSO&rsquo;s Financial Operations</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, Watsco&rsquo;s cash and cash equivalents totaled $526.3 million, significantly up from $210.1 million at the end of 2023. The company has no borrowings under its revolving credit facility, providing substantial access to capital for new growth opportunities.<br /><br />In 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $773.1 million compared with $562 million last year.</p><h2>WSO&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Watsco currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated</strong> LEG reported fourth-quarter 2024 results, with earnings meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues beating the same. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics declined.<br /><br />The quarterly results indicated weak demand in the company&rsquo;s residential end markets due to a challenging macro environment and soft consumer spending. Softening in Automotive and Hydraulic Cylinders further impacted its performance. Although LEG carried out its restructuring and operating efficiency improvement initiatives, the headwinds mentioned above overshadowed the prospects to a great extent.<br /><br /><strong>Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.</strong> MLM reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2024, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. Both the top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis.<br /><br />Despite challenges in 2024&mdash;such as bad weather, reduced construction demand and tighter monetary policies&mdash;the company still achieved earnings growth and record profits in the fourth quarter. This was driven by $6 billion in strategic acquisitions and divestitures, reshaping the portfolio to focus more on aggregates, improving margins and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Looking ahead, MLM is confident that strong infrastructure and data center demand will help it meet its 2025 adjusted EBITDA target of $2.25 billion.<br /><br /><strong>Masco Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s MAS fourth-quarter 2024 earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Earnings topped expectations in six of the trailing seven quarters. On the other hand, the net sales missed the consensus mark and tumbled year over year.<br /><br />The quarter&rsquo;s top-line results reflect lower sales volume for North American plumbing products, lower net selling prices of decorative architectural products and an unfavorable sales mix of plumbing products. However, the bottom line was favored by lower selling, general and administrative expenses, favorable net selling prices and strategic cost savings initiatives. Moving into 2025, the company aims to continue maintaining shareholder value through its top-tier repair and remodel-oriented product portfolio, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417946/watsco-s-q4-earnings-revenues-beat-hvac-equipment-sales-up-y-y?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2417946">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Builders FirstSource, Inc.</strong> BLDR is slated to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 20, before market open.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em><br /><br />In the last reported quarter, the company&rsquo;s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and net sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7% and 5.2%, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the top and the bottom lines tumbled 6.7% and 27.6%, respectively.<br /><br />BLDR&rsquo;s earnings topped the consensus mark in three of the trailing four quarters and missed on the remaining occasion, with the average surprise being 13%.</p><h2>Trend in BLDR&rsquo;s Estimates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s fourth-quarter EPS has moved south to $2.13 from $2.19 in the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a 40% year-over-year decline from $3.55.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Builders FirstSource, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Builders FirstSource, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/cc/1739973316.png" title="" width="538" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Builders FirstSource, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Builders FirstSource, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus estimate for net sales is pegged at $3.91 billion, indicating a decline of 5.7% from $4.15 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.</p><h2>Factors Likely to Influence Builders FirstSource&rsquo;s Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Revenues</strong><br /><br />The top-line performance of Builders FirstSource is expected to have declined year over year due to softness and uncertainty surrounding the housing market. The affordability concerns due to a still high mortgage rate and persistent sticky inflation are marring the housing start trends, which is directly affecting the company&rsquo;s sales volume. The Value-added product category (represented 49.2% of third quarter 2024 net sales) of BLDR, which includes manufactured products and windows, doors &amp; millwork, is likely to have been adversely impacted by the ongoing market headwinds.<br /><br />On the other hand, improved contributions from the other two reportable product categories of the company, Specialty building products &amp; services (represented 25.5% of third-quarter net sales) and Lumber &amp; lumber sheet goods (represented 25.3% of third-quarter net sales), are likely to have slightly offset the above headwinds during the quarter.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the net sales of the Value-added product category is pegged at $1.73 billion, indicating a decline from $2.16 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />The consensus mark for the net sales of the Specialty building products &amp; services and Lumber &amp; lumber sheet goods are pegged at $996 million and $1.09 billion, implying year-over-year growth of 5%, respectively.<br /><br /><strong>Earnings</strong><br /><br />The bottom line of BLDR is expected to have declined year over year due to increased expenses from higher inorganic activities, reduced operating leverage and a fall in the top line. The uncertainties revolving around the housing market and the inflationary pressures are not only hurting the sales growth trend but also hurting the margins.<br /><br />Although the company is focusing on fostering its growth through a transformed business model and differentiated product portfolio, the lingering macro risks and a gloomy housing demand environment are suppressing the prospects to a great extent.</p><h2>What the Zacks Model Predicts for BLDR</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Builders FirstSource this time around. A combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. Unfortunately, this is not the case here, as you will see below.<br /><br /><strong>Earnings ESP:</strong> BLDR has an Earnings ESP of +12.50%. You can uncover the best stocks before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank:</strong> The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Stocks With the Favorable Combination</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some companies in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector which, per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the respective quarters to be reported.<br /><br /><strong>Urban Outfitters, Inc.</strong> URBN currently has an Earnings ESP of +11.94% and a Zacks Rank of 2.<br /><br />URBN&rsquo;s earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 are expected to grow 29%. The company reported better-than-expected earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed on the remaining occasion, the average surprise being 22.8%.<br /><br /><strong>Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc.</strong> SFM currently has an Earnings ESP of +5.63% and a Zacks Rank of 2.<br /><br />SFM&rsquo;s earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024 are expected to increase 49%. The company reported better-than-expected earnings in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 15.3%.<br /><br /><strong>Costco Wholesale Corporation</strong> COST has an Earnings ESP of +0.14% and a Zacks Rank of 2.<br /><br />COST reported better-than-expected earnings in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 2%. The company&rsquo;s earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 are expected to increase 10.2%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417947/builders-firstsource-set-to-report-q4-earnings-what-s-in-store?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2417947">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Housing Puts Up Mixed Numbers; Earnings for ETSY, GRMN & More ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:18:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Wednesday, February 19, 2025</strong><br /><br />New data on the housing market is out this morning ahead of the opening bell, further illustrating a profounds cooling down in this industry. We also see a slew of new quarterly earnings this morning, most of which are beating expectations but lowering guidance. Thus, we see the Dow -125 points at this hour, the S&amp;P 500 is -15 and the Nasdaq -40.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>Housing Starts, Building Permits Mixed in January</h2><p>New <strong>Housing Starts</strong> last month were notably lower than the previous month: January&rsquo;s tally of 1.37 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units was slightly below the 1.4 million expected, but more than 100K under December&rsquo;s 1.51 million. Single-family starts &mdash; where the big profits are made in this industry &mdash; were down -8.4% month over month. Multi-family levels were also lower, but not as drastically.<br /><br /><strong>Building Permits</strong> reached 1.48 million for the month, in-line with December&rsquo;s total and now three-straight months at 1.48 million or higher. This morning&rsquo;s headline was higher than the 1.46 million analysts were looking for. Permits are seen as a proxy for future housing starts.<br /><br />That said, with mortgage rates moving from +7% to +7.25% last month, the appetite for new housing is suffering. We saw yesterday in the NAHB homebuilders survey that confidence in the industry dropped -5% to a 5-month low. Even being at the foothills of the spring homebuilding season, we remain concerned that prospective homebuyers will remain on the sidelines &mdash; either until rates start coming down or at least some clarity to the future economy starts to appear.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>Quarterly Earnings Roundup: ETSY, GRMN, JLL</h2><br /><p><strong>Etsy</strong> ETSY shares are down -6.7% this morning, after Q4 earnings beat expectations but quarterly sales came in below estimates. Earnings of $1.03 per share outpaced the 95 cents in the Zacks consensus by +8.4%, while revenues of $852.2 million missed the $861.7 million analysts were projecting. Shares are giving back most of their +8.3% gains made year to date. For more on ETSY&rsquo;s earnings, click here.<br /><br /><strong>Check out the updated Zacks Earnings Calendar here.</strong><br /><br />GPS products provider <strong>Garmin</strong> GRMN reported outperformance on both top and bottom lines in its Q4 report before today&rsquo;s opening bell: earnings of $2.41 per share came in +24% higher than the anticipated $1.89, and even more than the year-ago&rsquo;s reported $1.72 per share. Revenues of $1.82 billion surged beyond the consensus $1.68 billion, and shares are +10% in today&rsquo;s pre-market on the news. For more on GRMN&rsquo;s earnings, click here.<br /><br />Chicago-based retail management corporation <strong>Jones Lang LaSalle</strong> JLL outpaced expectations this morning, with earnings of $6.15 per share easily ahead of the $5.79 expected, with revenues of $6.81 billion bettering the $6.48 billion analysts were looking for. Higher transactional growth led the way in the quarter. Shares initially spike on the news, but have come back down to yesterday&rsquo;s close. Shares are up +11.4% year to date.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>What to Expect from the Stock Market Today</h2><br /><p>The biggest news we&rsquo;re anticipating before the closing bell today is the release of the<strong> Fed meeting minutes</strong> from last month, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) predictably kept interest rates steady at +4.25-4.50%. Based on data and opinion we&rsquo;ve seen lately, we don&rsquo;t expect this to change any time in the near future. Thus, we may seek nuances in the notes today, but feel we are unlikely to be surprised by any particulars.<br /><br />Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

<![CDATA[ Are Options Traders Betting on a Big Move in National CineMedia (NCMI) Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:11:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>National CineMedia, Inc.</strong> NCMI need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Mar 21, 2025 $10.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h2>What is Implied Volatility?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h2>What do the Analysts Think?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for National CineMedia shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, National CineMedia is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Advertising and Marketing industry that ranks in the Bottom 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of 18 cents per share to 20 cents in that period.<br /><br />Given the way analysts feel about National CineMedia right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><h2>Looking to Trade Options?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.<br /><br /><strong>Click to see the trades now &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417933/are-options-traders-betting-on-a-big-move-in-national-cinemedia-ncmi-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|options-2417933">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Pitney Bowes Surges 47% in a Month: Time to Buy the Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:08:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pitney Bowes</strong> PBI shares have jumped 46.6% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the broader S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s return of 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively. Pitney Bowes&rsquo; strong rally over the past month highlights the confidence that investors have in PBI&rsquo;s strong foothold in the global logistics and technology space.</p><h2>PBI Grows on the Back of Strong Customer Base and Partners</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Pitney Bowes&rsquo; broad customer base, which includes more than 90% of Fortune 500 companies, is a testament to its market leadership. Its collaboration with industry giants, such as <strong>Amazon </strong>AMZN, <strong>eBay </strong>EBAY, Shopify and <strong>Salesforce </strong>CRM, further strengthens its position in the global logistics and technology space.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, Pitney Bowes provides cross-border e-commerce logistics services to eBay in the U.S. and U.K. markets. Its longstanding partnership with Amazon Web Services (&ldquo;AWS&rdquo;) and membership in the AWS Solution Provider Network highlights its ability to integrate seamlessly with cutting-edge technologies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PBI and Salesforce are connected through the latter&rsquo;s Shipping API Partner Program. These collaborations not only diversify its revenue streams but also position it for long-term growth.</p><h3>One-month Price Return Performance</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/58/94454.jpg?v=1908026100" style="height: 369px; width: 610px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>PBI Accelerates Growth by Divesting Its GEC Business</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Pitney Bowes has long grappled with the underperformance of its Global Ecommerce (GEC) segment. PBI had made significant investments, including the acquisitions of Borderfree in 2015 and Newgistics in 2017 to bolster the GEC business. The segment initially gained traction during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, after the pandemic, declining package volumes and aggressive discounting by competitors dragged down its profitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Recognizing GEC as a liability, Pitney Bowes has divested this segment, with a one-time exit cost of $165 million of which $120 million has already been paid in 2024. This strategic exit allows PBI to focus on its higher-margin businesses, bolstering profitability and enabling a leaner operational structure.</p><h2>PBI Demonstrates Robust Financial Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Pitney Bowes&rsquo; efforts to address its substantial long-term debt and improve liquidity are already bearing fruit. By repatriating $117 million from overseas operations, the company has amassed more than $100 million in excess cash, which will support debt reduction and enhance its financial flexibility.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Pitney Bowes is strongly focusing on debt reduction and financial strengthening. On the fourth-quarter earnings call, PBI reported that it paid off $275 million Oaktree notes with internally generated cash. The company also reduced offshore cash holdings by $90 million, improving cash availability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PBI is demonstrating solid financial recovery as well. The company has witnessed strong improvement in non-GAAP operating profit and margin throughout 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, adjusted operating profit grew 33% year over year to $114 million, while margin expanded 580 basis points to 22.2%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Analysts are also optimistic about Pitney Bowes&rsquo; earnings growth potential. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has moved up by 9 cents to $1.21 in the past seven days, indicating 47.6% year-over-year growth. The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 96.64%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><h2>Pitney Bowes&rsquo; Attractive Valuation Signals Uptrend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the stellar performance, Pitney Bowes still trades at a discounted valuation. Pitney Bowes&rsquo; forward 12-month P/E ratio sits at 8.70X, significantly lower than the Zacks Computer and Technology sector&rsquo;s average of 26.19X and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s average of 22.66X.</p><h3>PBI 12-month P/E Ratio</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/0c/94455.jpg?v=78052224" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Additionally, PBI shares are trading above the 50-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9e/94456.jpg?v=701516515" style="height: 314px; width: 610px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Conclusion: Buy PBI Stock Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Pitney Bowes is at an inflection point, with its strategic realignment and cost-cutting initiatives paving the way for sustainable growth. The divestiture of the GEC segment, coupled with financial discipline and robust partnerships, positions the company for long-term profitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given its strong financial recovery, undervalued stock price and promising growth outlook, PBI offers a compelling investment opportunity. Investors looking to capitalize on this transformation should consider adding the stock to their portfolios now. PBI currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

<![CDATA[ ELTP Stock Falls Following Q3 Earnings Decline, Revenue Down Y/Y ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:05:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </strong>ELTP have lost 3.3% since the company reported its earnings for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2024. This compares to the S&amp;P 500 Index&rsquo;s 1.2% gain over the same time frame. Over the past month, the stock gained 7.6% compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 2% rise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</em></strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Financial Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Elite Pharmaceuticals reported consolidated revenues of $14.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 ended Dec. 31, 2024, reflecting a 7.6% decline from the $15.5 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. The company attributed the decline to timing differences at the end of December, which resulted in shipment delays that pushed revenue recognition into January 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Manufacturing fees, the primary revenue driver, declined 7.1% to $13.7 million from $14.8 million a year earlier. Licensing fees fell 16.3% to $0.6 million from $0.7 million a year earlier, reflecting the company&rsquo;s shift away from third-party licensing agreements in favor of its own branded sales.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Gross profit came in at $6.1 million, down 13.1% from the prior-year period&rsquo;s $7 million. The company&rsquo;s gross margin slipped to 43% from 45% a year ago, impacted by lower revenue levels and an unfavorable product mix.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Operating expenses surged 43.1% to $5 million from $3.5 million a year earlier, primarily due to a 59.2% increase in general and administrative costs to $2.7 million from $1.7 million a year earlier, reflecting higher personnel expenses and regulatory compliance costs. Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses rose 27.8% to $1.8 million from $1.4 million a year earlier as the company expanded its product development efforts. Operating profit declined sharply to $1.1 million from $3.5 million in the prior-year quarter, representing a 68.9% drop.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ELTP reported a net loss of $10.9 million against a net income of $0.7 million in the prior-year quarter. This sharp downturn was primarily driven by a $11.7 million loss related to changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments &mdash; warrants. The company also recorded an income tax expense of $0.2 million against an income tax benefit of $0.8 million in the prior-year quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Elite Pharmaceuticals reported a loss per share of $0.01 for the quarter against breakeven earnings per share in the prior-year period.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Elite Pharmaceuticals Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Elite Pharmaceuticals Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/96/1739970761.png" style="width: 620px; height: 266px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Elite Pharmaceuticals Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Elite Pharmaceuticals Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Key Business Metrics</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Interest expense was $16,088 and $18,200 for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $51,783 and $57,985 for the nine months ended Dec. 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The company did not record any gains from settlement agreements in the quarter, whereas the prior-year period had benefited from a $1.8 million gain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the nine months ended Dec. 31, 2024, total revenues grew 34.6% to $52 million, driven by a 39.2% increase in manufacturing fees to $50.4 million from $36.2 million. However, the company&rsquo;s net loss was $21.3 million against a $16.8 million net income in the same period last year. This was largely due to a $27.3 million loss related to derivative financial instruments.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Management Commentary</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Elite Pharmaceuticals&rsquo; management acknowledged that revenue for the quarter was impacted by shipment delays but noted that these sales were expected to be recognized in the following quarter. The company also highlighted continued progress in developing its product pipeline and expanding its manufacturing capabilities.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Influencing Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">While the company&rsquo;s shift toward self-branded sales is expected to drive long-term growth, the transition has weighed on short-term licensing revenue. Additionally, holiday-related shipping delays affected sales timing, pushing some revenue into the following quarter. Increased investment in R&amp;D and regulatory compliance further contributed to margin compression.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The sharp increase in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, a non-cash charge tied to stock warrants, significantly impacted the bottom line. Given ELTP&rsquo;s capital structure, fluctuations in its stock price could continue to create earnings volatility.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Guidance and Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Elite Pharmaceuticals did not provide specific forward guidance. However, management remains focused on expanding its product portfolio, ramping up manufacturing capabilities and increasing sales under the Elite label.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Developments</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">During the quarter, Elite Pharmaceuticals completed the $900,000 acquisition of three ANDAs from Nostrum Laboratories Inc. These include generic versions of Norco (Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone Bitartrate), Percocet (Oxycodone Hydrochloride and Acetaminophen) and Dolophine (Methadone Hydrochloride) tablets. The acquisition enhances the company&rsquo;s pipeline in the opioid and pain management segment. While the company has commercially launched its Norco generic, the remaining two products have yet to hit the market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company commercially launched its generic version of Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate) for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in December 2024. The product is marketed under the Elite label.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, on Feb. 9, 2025, the FDA approved ELTP&rsquo;s newly constructed facility in Northvale, NJ, as a commercial packaging site. This regulatory milestone enhances the company&rsquo;s ability to scale operations.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417929/eltp-stock-falls-following-q3-earnings-decline-revenue-down-y-y?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-microcap_article-2417929">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ CETX Stock Falls Post Q1 Earnings Decline on Security Segment Weakness ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>Cemtrex, Inc.</strong> CETX have lost 7.9% since the company reported its earnings for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2024. This compares to the S&amp;P 500 Index&rsquo;s 0.02% decline over the same time frame. Over the past month, the stock lost 32.2% versus the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 2% rise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Performance and Segmental Overview</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For the fiscal first quarter of 2025, Cemtrex reported revenues of $13.7 million, marking an 18.6% year-over-year decline from $16.9 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily attributed to the company&rsquo;s Security segment, which saw a sharp 40.5% dip in revenues to $5.5 million from $9.2 million in the prior-year quarter, as demand for security technology products under the Vicon brand weakened. Meanwhile, the Industrial Services segment posted a 7.5% revenue increase to $8.3 million from $7.7 million in the prior-year quarter, benefiting from strong market demand and recent contract wins.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Gross profit for the quarter declined 19.5% to $5.7 million, representing 41.5% of revenues, from $7.1 million, or 41.9% of revenue, in the prior-year period. Operating expenses increased 2.1% to $7.9 million from $7.8 million, primarily due to higher salaries, general and administrative expenses, and research and development (R&amp;D) investments in security technology.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cemtrex reported an operating loss of $2.3 million, widening from $0.7 million a year ago. The net loss increased to $28.9 million from $1.3 million in the previous year&rsquo;s quarter, largely due to $25.8 million in non-cash warrant-related losses.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Cemtrex Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Cemtrex Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/b6/1739970084.png" style="width: 620px; height: 266px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Cemtrex Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Cemtrex Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Key Business Metrics</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $5.5 million as of Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $5.4 million as of Sept. 30, 2024. The company&rsquo;s inventory increased significantly to $11.1 million as of Dec. 31, 2024, from $6.9 million as of Sept. 30, reflecting preparation for anticipated orders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cemtrex&rsquo;s accounts payable declined to $3.5 million as of Dec. 31 from $4.5 million as of Sept. 30, 2024, while the company&rsquo;s revolving line of credit increased to $4.1 million as of Dec. 31 from $3.1 million as of Sept. 30, 2024.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Management Commentary and Market Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chairman and CEO Saagar Govil acknowledged the challenges faced by the Security segment but noted a turnaround in January 2025, with record orders, including a $10.4 million contract for Valerus surveillance system expansion for a state government corrections facility in the mid-Atlantic region. The company expects fiscal second-quarter sales to put it on track for year-over-year growth of 15-20%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Vicon launched the NEXT Modular Camera System, integrating AI analytics and Hailo-15 edge AI processing, a development management believes will strengthen its position in the security industry. Additionally, the segment introduced an AI-driven gun detection feature for its cameras, targeting enhanced public safety.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Industrial Services segment continued to gain traction, securing two wastewater infrastructure projects worth $6.7 million. CETX aims to drive further growth in this segment through additional acquisitions.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Influencing Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The steep net loss was primarily due to a $25.8 million charge related to the excess fair value of exercised warrants, which resulted from CETX&rsquo;s multiple reverse stock splits. Additionally, the decline in security segment revenues was compounded by industry-wide demand softness and uncertainty regarding public-sector contracts amid the federal administration transition.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">While Cemtrex did not provide explicit financial guidance, management reiterated its optimism about both business segments. The Security division anticipates a rebound with growing demand for AI-powered surveillance solutions, while the Industrial Services unit is expected to maintain steady growth through project completions and new contract wins.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Developments</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">During the quarter, Cemtrex executed a 60:1 and a subsequent 35:1 reverse stock split to maintain compliance with Nasdaq&rsquo;s minimum bid price requirements. The company also restructured its royalty agreement related to the divestiture of Cemtrex XR, eliminating a prior $820,000 minimum royalty obligation.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417926/cetx-stock-falls-post-q1-earnings-decline-on-security-segment-weakness?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-microcap_article-2417926">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Is the Options Market Predicting a Spike in ConocoPhillips (COP) Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>ConocoPhillips </strong>COP need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Mar 21, 2025 $60 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What is Implied Volatility?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What do the Analysts Think?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for ConocoPhillips shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, ConocoPhillips is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry that ranks in the Top 15% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.91 per share to $2.06 in that period.<br /><br />Given the way analysts feel about ConocoPhillips right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Looking to Trade Options?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.<br /><br /><strong>Click to see the trades now &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417927/is-the-options-market-predicting-a-spike-in-conocophillips-cop-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|options-2417927">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ ADMA Biologics Gears Up to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">We expect investors to focus on the sales performance of&nbsp;<strong>ADMA Biologics</strong>&rsquo; ADMA portfolio of marketed products and other pipeline updates when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 results.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar </em></strong><strong><em>to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter&rsquo;s revenues is pegged at $112.2 million. The consensus mark for earnings is pinned at 15 cents per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#39;s see how things might have shaped up for ADMA Biologics in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.</p><h2>Factors to Consider Regarding ADMA&rsquo;s Q4 Earnings</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ADMA Biologics markets plasma-derived biologics for the treatment of immune deficiencies and the prevention of certain infectious diseases. The company&rsquo;s top line currently comprises sales of three FDA-approved products, namely &ndash; Bivigam (to treat primary humoral immunodeficiency), Asceniv (to treat primary immunodeficiency disease or PIDD) and Nabi-HB (to treat and provide enhanced immunity against the hepatitis B virus).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues are expected to have jumped year over year in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by increased sales of its immunoglobulin products. The company&rsquo;s commercial specialty biologics product portfolio, especially Asceniv, has been witnessing strong growth and the momentum is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of ADMA Biologics have plunged 24.3% in the past three months against the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 0.8% growth.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/96/94424.jpg?v=376556593" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">ADMA&rsquo;s supplemental biologics license applications (sBLAs) for both Asceniv and Bivigam were approved by the FDA last year. This extended the approved four-week room temperature (25&deg;C) storage conditions during the first 24 months of shelf life to allow for a four-week room temperature storage at any point during the entire 36-month approved shelf life for Asceniv and Bivigam. The FDA nod for the extension of room temperature storage conditions for Asceniv and Bivigam is expected to have boosted their sales in the to-be-reported quarter as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors can also expect an update regarding the company&rsquo;s plans for an sBLA submission seeking label expansion of Asceniv to treat pediatric patients with PIDD in the upcoming earnings release.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last month, ADMA provided its outlook for 2025 and 2026. ADMA now expects to generate revenues of more than $485 million in 2025 and $600 million in 2026 (previous guidance: more than $465 million in 2025). Net income is projected to exceed $170 million in 2025 and $230 million in 2026 (up from the prior guidance of $165 million for 2025).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ADMA Biologics is also looking to advance the pre-clinical work for its&nbsp;<em>S</em>. pneumonia hyperimmune globulin pipeline program in 2025.&nbsp;<em>S</em>. pneumonia is the main cause of community-acquired pneumonia in the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The activities related to pipeline development are most likely to have escalated ADMA Biologics&rsquo; operating expenses in the fourth quarter.</p><h2>Earnings Whispers for ADMA</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for ADMA Biologics this time around. The combination of a positive&nbsp;Earnings ESP&nbsp;and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&#39;re reported with our&nbsp;Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Earnings ESP:</strong>&nbsp;ADMA Biologics has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 15 cents per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Zacks Rank:</strong>&nbsp;ADMA Biologics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>ADMA Biologics Inc Price and Consensus</h2> <img alt="ADMA Biologics Inc Price and Consensus" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/1d/1739968600.png" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" title="" /> <p>ADMA Biologics Inc price-consensus-chart | ADMA Biologics Inc Quote</p></div><h2>Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are a few stocks worth considering from the healthcare space, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pacira BioSciences, Inc.</strong>&nbsp;PCRX has an Earnings ESP of +2.77% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of PCRX have surged 55.3% in the past three months. PCRX beat earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met once and missed the same on the remaining occasion, delivering an average surprise of 7.13%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</strong>&nbsp;MIRM has an Earnings ESP of +24.63% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of MIRM have surged 20.6% in the past three months. MIRM beat on earnings in one of the trailing four quarters while missing the same in the remaining three occasions, delivering an average negative surprise of 26.03%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Viking Therapeutics&nbsp;</strong>VKTX has an Earnings ESP of +1.09% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of VKTX have plunged 43.2% in the past three months.

<![CDATA[ Pick These 4 Stocks With Impressive Interest Coverage Ratios ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">An ill-informed investor can lose cash if he wagers on a stock only based on the numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of a company&rsquo;s financial background is a must for a better investment decision, especially at a time when the stock market is juggling myriad issues.<br /><br />Often, investors evaluate a company&rsquo;s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company&rsquo;s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the coverage ratio comes into play &mdash; the higher the metric, the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.<br /><br /><strong>Deckers Outdoor Corporation</strong> DECK, <strong>Boot Barn Holdings, Inc.</strong> BOOT, <strong>Addus HomeCare Corporation</strong> ADUS and <strong>The Ensign Group, Inc.</strong> ENSG boast an impressive interest coverage ratio.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Interest Coverage Ratio?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay interest charges on its debt.<br /><br />Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. The company&rsquo;s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.<br /><br />Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.&nbsp;<br /><br />The interest coverage ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.<br /><br />An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company&rsquo;s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over time.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Winning Strategy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a <strong>VGM Score</strong> of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.<br /><br /><strong>Interest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry Median</strong><br /><br /><strong>Price greater than or equal to 5:</strong> The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.<br /><br /><strong>5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median:</strong> Stocks with a strong EPS growth history.<br /><br /><strong>Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median:</strong> This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000:</strong> A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2:</strong> Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.<br /><br /><strong>VGM Score of less than or equal to B:</strong> Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.<br /><br />Here are four of the 22 stocks that qualified the screening:<br /><br /><strong>Deckers</strong>, a global leader in designing, marketing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel and accessories, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B.

<![CDATA[ Implied Volatility Surging for Healthcare Services Group (HCSG) Stock Options ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>Healthcare Services Group, Inc.</strong> HCSG need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 20, 2025 $2.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What is Implied Volatility?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What do the Analysts Think?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Healthcare Services Group shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Healthcare Services Group is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Business - Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 20 cents per share to 18 cents in that period.<br /><br />Given the way analysts feel about Healthcare Services Group right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Looking to Trade Options?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.<br /><br /><strong>Click to see the trades now &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417918/implied-volatility-surging-for-healthcare-services-group-hcsg-stock-options?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|options-2417918">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Matador Beats on Q4 Earnings & Revenues, Raises Dividend ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Matador Resources Company</strong>&nbsp;MTDR reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $1.83 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74. The bottom line, however, declined from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level of $1.99.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues of $970.4 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $955 million. The top line also increased from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s figure of $836.1 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The better-than-expected quarterly results were driven by Matador&rsquo;s high total production volume, including higher contributions from its non-operated assets. However, lower commodity prices partially offset the positives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Matador Resources Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Matador Resources Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/98/1739972935.png" title="" width="574" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Matador Resources Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Matador Resources Company Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Dividend Hike</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Matador Resources announced a quarterly cash dividend of 31.25 cents per share (annualized dividend of $1.25), implying a 25% increase from the previous level of 25 cents. The dividend is payable on Mar. 14, 2025, to shareholders of record as of Feb. 28, 2025.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Upstream Business in Q4</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Being primarily involved in oil and gas exploration and production activities, the fate of MTDR&rsquo;s overall business depends on the oil and gas pricing environment. Most of Matador&rsquo;s production comprises oil (58.9% of total production in the fourth quarter), making this commodity&rsquo;s price the prime factor in determining the company&rsquo;s earnings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Matador achieved a record average daily oil production in the fourth quarter of 2024. However, the figure suggested a decline of 1% from the anticipated average.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let us take a look at Matador&rsquo;s average commodity sales price, along with production.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Average Sales Price of Commodities</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MTDR reported the average sales price for oil (without realized derivatives) at $70.66 per barrel, down from $79 a year ago. The commodity price was also lower than our projection of $71.24 per barrel. The price of natural gas was $2.72 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf), down from $3.01 in the year-ago quarter. The figure also came in lower than our estimate of $2.89 Mcf.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Increasing Production</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Matador reported oil production of 118,440 barrels per day (B/D), up from 88,663 B/D in the prior-year quarter. The figure, however, missed our estimate of 119,200 B/D. Natural gas production was recorded at 496.1 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/D), up from 393.6 MMcf/D recorded a year ago. The reported figure outpaced our estimate of 472.8 MMcf/D.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The rise in total average production can be attributed to higher production from the new wells drilled and brought into production in the third quarter of 2024 in MTDR&rsquo;s Rustler Breaks and Ranger asset areas. The stronger-than-expected production from the company&rsquo;s non-operated assets contributed to the increase. Additionally, production from Matador&rsquo;s Ameredev assets exceeded expectations, driving record production volumes in the reported quarter.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total oil equivalent production in the fourth quarter was 201,116 BOE/D, which surged from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level of 154,261 BOE/D. This was also the first time Matador achieved an average production exceeding 200,000 BOE per day in a quarter. The figure was also above our projection of 198,007.7 BOE/D.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Operating Expenses</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MTDR&rsquo;s plant and other midstream services&rsquo; operating expenses increased to $2.75 per BOE from the year-earlier level of $2.56. Our estimate for the same was pinned at $2.56.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lease operating costs increased to $5.37 per BOE from $5.06 a year ago. Our projection for the metric was pinned at $5.76 per BOE. However, production taxes, transportation and processing costs decreased to $4.70 per BOE from $5.31 in the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total operating expenses per BOE were $30.89, higher than the prior-year figure of $30.52 but below our estimate of $30.95.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Balance Sheet &amp; Capital Spending</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, Matador had cash and restricted cash of $94.7 million and a long-term debt of $3,325.4 million. In the fourth quarter, the company spent $317.4 million on well drilling, completion and equipment.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2025, Matador has guided average daily oil equivalent production at 202,000-208,000 Boe/d. This implies a 20% increase from the previous projection. The company also projects average daily total production for the first quarter of 2025 to lie in the range of 195,000 to 197,000 Boe/d.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MTDR&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Other Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MTDR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other top-ranked stocks from the energysector are <strong>SM Energy </strong>SM, <strong>Equinor ASA</strong> EQNR and <strong>Archrock Inc.</strong> AROC. SM Energy currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Equinor and Archrock carry a Zacks Rank #2 each. <strong>You can see&nbsp;</strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here<strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">SM Energy is set to expand its oil-centered operations in the coming years, with an increasing focus on crude oil, especially in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford regions. The increased production, combined with the favorable oil price environment, is expected to positively contribute to its bottom line.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Equinor ASA is one of the leading integrated energy companies globally and the second-largest supplier of natural gas in Europe. The company&rsquo;s expansion in the renewable energy space positions it for long-term growth as more and more countries transition toward cleaner energy solutions to meet their climate goals. Its strategic pivot toward low-carbon energy solutions unlocks new revenue streams in the growing market for clean energy and carbon management solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Archrock is an energy infrastructure company based in the United States, with a focus on midstream natural gas compression. It provides natural gas contract compression services and generates stable fee-based revenues.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417915/matador-beats-on-q4-earnings-revenues-raises-dividend?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2417915">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Lockheed Secures Contract for F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Jet Program ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:56:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Lockheed Martin Corporation&rsquo;s</strong> LMT Aeronautics business segment recently clinched a modification contract to support the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft program. The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.</p><h2>Details of LMT&rsquo;s Deal<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Valued at nearly $28 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2028. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide program management support for special test and tooling equipment, aircraft modifications and flight test instrumentation to aid the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.<br /><br />The contract will serve the U.S. Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Foreign Military Sales customers and non-Department of Defense participants. The work related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX.</p><h2>What&rsquo;s Favoring LMT Stock?<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Aerial security, a critical component of national defense, has seen an increased emphasis on purchasing technologically advanced fighter jets with improved stealth capabilities, such as Lockheed Martin&#39;s F-35.<br /><br />Notably, the F-35&#39;s cutting-edge sensors and communication technologies enable it to operate smoothly across multiple fields, including air, land, sea, space and ground-based platforms.<br /><br />These features must have been driving strong demand for F-35 jets, which can be further gauged from the fact that since its launch, Lockheed has delivered 1,102 units as of Dec. 31, 2024. The latest contract win is another bright example of LMT&rsquo;s F-35 enjoying significant demand in the military aviation space.</p><h2>LMT&rsquo;s Growth Potential<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Rising military conflicts, terrorism and border disputes, along with rapid technological advancements in combat jets, have led nations to increase their defense spending on combat-proven jets, which constitute an integral part of their defense structure.<br /><br />This is likely to have prompted the Mordor Intelligence firm to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 4.7% for the military aviation market during the 2025-2030 period.<br /><br />Such strong market prospects drive growth opportunities for Lockheed, backed by its robust portfolio of combat jets, including F-21, F-2 Support Fighter, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor and F-35 jets.</p><h2>Opportunities for Other Defense Companies<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Other defense companies that are likely to reap the benefits of the military aviation market are listed below:<br /><br /><strong>Northrop Grumman Corp.</strong> NOC: It is a leading provider of manned and unmanned air systems. It builds some of the world&rsquo;s most advanced aircraft like the E-2C Hawkeye 2000, A-10 Thunderbolt II, F-5 Tiger Fighter Jet and a few more.<br /><br />Northrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 4.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC&rsquo;s 2025 sales calls for an improvement of 3.2% from the prior-year reported number.<br /><br /><strong>The Boeing Company</strong> BA: The company offers a comprehensive portfolio of the most advanced aircraft in the combat market, which includes F/A-18 Super Hornet, P-8, F-15EX, CH-47 Chinook, Chinook Block II, EA-18G Growler and a few more.<br /><br />Boeing boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 17.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA&rsquo;s 2025 sales suggests an improvement of 25.4% from the prior-year reported number.<br /><br /><strong>Embraer S.A. </strong>ERJ: The company offers a comprehensive portfolio of the most advanced aircraft in the combat market, which includes the A-29 Super Tucano, P600 AEW&amp;C and the C-390 Millennium military multi-mission aircraft.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ERJ&rsquo;s 2025 sales indicates growth of 17.8% from the prior-year estimated number. The company delivered an average earnings surprise of 127.28% in the last four quarters.</p><h2>LMT Stock Price Movement<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>In the past year, Lockheed shares have fallen 0.3% compared with the industry&rsquo;s decline of 4.8%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b8/94466.jpg?v=1197170236" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>LMT&rsquo;s Zacks Rank<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Lockheed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ Expanding Diabetes Business Supports ABT Stock, FX Issues Stay ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abbott</strong>&rsquo;s ABT diversified business portfolio is well-positioned to drive continued momentum in 2025. Yet, the international business environment continues to be challenging. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><h2>Factors Driving ABT Shares</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Within Abbott&rsquo;s Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business, the company is strategically progressing in biosimilars. Abbott, leveraging on its leading presence in emerging markets, is enjoying a unique opportunity to scale a licensing model that is capital-efficient and can bring access to these life-changing medicines to the emerging market population. The first round of commercialization is on track for 2025. The company is highly optimistic about this initiative, considering the fact that biosimilars represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Abbott continues to expand its Diagnostics business (comprised 23% of the total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2024). Over the past few quarters, the company has been witnessing increased global demand for routine diagnostics (excluding COVID-19&nbsp; testing sales). In the fourth quarter of 2024, rapid diagnostics, excluding COVID-testing sales, increased 16% year over year. Core Laboratory Diagnostics&rsquo; growth of 4% was driven by continued strong demand for Abbott&rsquo;s immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screening testing panels.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Abbott&rsquo;s Diabetes Care business continued to benefit from the growing sales of its flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. In a relatively short span, FreeStyle Libre has achieved global leadership among continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for both Type 1 and Type 2 users.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the fourth quarter, in Diabetes Care, sales of CGM exceeded $1.8 billion and grew 23%. For full-year 2024, sales of CGM were approximately $6.5 billion and grew 22% from 2023. This included growth of 27% in the United States.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Abbott Laboratories Price</h2> <img alt="Abbott Laboratories Price" height="250" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/78/1739970593.png" title="" width="538" /> <p>Abbott Laboratories price | Abbott Laboratories Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past three months, shares of ABT have gained 11.8% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 6.2% growth. The company&rsquo;s consistent efforts to expand in the high-growth areas, as well as its array of new product launches, are expected to help maintain the stock&rsquo;s uptrend in the coming days.</p><h2>Concerns Remain for Abbott</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Abbott due to a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. The strengthening of the euro and some other developed market currencies has constantly been hampering the company&rsquo;s performance in the international markets. In the fourth quarter of 2024, foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on sales.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The challenging macroeconomic scenario in the form of the ongoing complex geo-political situation globally, specifically where Abbott operates, is driving a higher-than-anticipated increase in expenses in terms of raw materials and freight. These could also result in broader economic impacts and security concerns, affecting the company&rsquo;s business in the upcoming months. Industrywide, it has been seen that the deteriorating global economic environment is reducing demand for several MedTech products, resulting in lower sales and lower product prices while increasing the cost of goods and operating expenses of the businesses of the MedTech companies.<br /><br />In the fourth quarter, Abbott incurred an 8.5% increase in the cost of products sold (excluding amortization expense). The gross margin contracted 55 basis points to 55%.

<![CDATA[ Biotech Stock Roundup: MRNA's Q4 Results, GILD's Update & Other News ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:39:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">It was a busy week for the biotech sector. While the fourth-quarter earnings season continues, other pipeline and regulatory updates were also in focus.</p><h2><u>Recap of the Week&rsquo;s Most Important Stories</u>:</h2><h2>MRNA&rsquo;s Q4 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Moderna</strong> MRNA reported a loss of $2.50 per share in the fourth quarter of 2024, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $2.69. In the year-ago period, the company had reported earnings of 55 cents per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues declined 64% year over year to $966 million, primarily due to the declining sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and the soft sales performance of its recently launched RSV vaccine.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MRNA recorded $923 million in Spikevax sales for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with $2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moderna reiterated its total revenue guidance for 2025, which was issued last month. It expects total revenues to be in the range of $1.5-$2.5 billion, mainly from product sales of its COVID-19 and RSV vaccines. Owing to the seasonality of its business, management expects to generate around $0.2 billion in revenues in the first half of the year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moderna currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>GILD&rsquo;s HIV Prevention Treatment Application Accepted</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Gilead Sciences, Inc.</strong> GILD announced that the FDA has accepted its new drug application (NDA) submissions for its twice-yearly injectable HIV-1 capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir, for the prevention of HIV as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The regulatory body will review the applications under priority review and has assigned a target action date of June 19, 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The NDAs are based on data from the late-stage PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2 studies.&nbsp; Data from the PURPOSE I study showed twice-yearly lenacapavir demonstrated zero infections in the lenacapavir group and 100% risk reduction and superiority compared to background HIV incidence for the investigational use of HIV prevention in cisgender women.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The PURPOSE 2 study showed that there were two HIV infections in the lenacapavir group, demonstrating 99.9% of participants in the lenacapavir group did not acquire HIV infection, a 96% risk reduction in HIV infections, and superiority compared to bHIV among a broad and geographically diverse range of cisgender men and gender-diverse people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Gilead also recently submitted applications for lenacapavir for PrEP to the European Medicines Agency that will be reviewed under accelerated assessment review timeline.</p><h2>SEPN Stock Plunges on Trial Update</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Septerna, Inc</strong>. SEPN announced that it will discontinue the phase I single and multiple-ascending dose (SAD/MAD) clinical trial of pipeline candidate SEP-786 in healthy volunteers. SEP-786 is an oral small-molecule agonist of the parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) being developed for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of this clinical-stage biotechnology company plunged 47% on the news.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SEPN decided to discontinue the study following the observation of two unanticipated severe (Grade 3) events of elevated unconjugated bilirubin in the MAD portion of the phase I study, both of which were without elevations in ALT, AST and GGT liver enzyme levels. Dosing was discontinued for both study participants, and the bilirubin elevations were reversible.</p><h2>SLDB Up on Study Data</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Solid Biosciences Inc</strong>. SLDB announced positive initial data from the phase I/II INSPIRE DUCHENNE trial evaluating SGT-003, a next-generation gene therapy product candidate intended for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne). Interim biopsy data reported in the first three participants at day 90 showed an average microdystrophin expression of 110%, as measured by western blot, and improvements in multiple biomarkers that are indicators of muscle health and resilience.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Data also showed encouraging early signals of potential cardiac benefit. SGT-003 has been well-tolerated by the six participants dosed as of Feb. 11, 2025, with no serious adverse events observed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Enrollment is ongoing, and the company expects to dose approximately 20 participants by the fourth quarter of 2025. SLDB plans to request an FDA meeting in mid-2025 to discuss a potential accelerated approval pathway for SGT-003.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of SLDB were up following the announcement. Solid Biosciences Inc. also announced the pricing of an underwritten offering of 35,739,810 shares of its common stock at a price of $4.03 per share.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has gained 3.08% in the past four trading sessions and MRNA&rsquo;s shares have gained 15.6%. In the past six months, shares of MRNA have plunged 60.26%.

<![CDATA[ 5 Low-Leverage Stocks to Buy Amid Weak Market Sentiment ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:39:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The majority of U.S. equities indices finished barely in the green on Feb. 18, following President&rsquo;s Day. This reflected investors&rsquo; skepticism surrounding Trump&rsquo;s tariff policy and hardly any possibility of a Fed rate cut. Notably, the U.S. President indicated levying a 25% tariff on automobile, semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports yesterday. The general market consensus indicated that the Fed might not cut interest rates anytime soon to tackle inflation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In such a situation, an investor might not feel confident enough to invest in the stock market. However, a prudent investor knows that this is the right time to buy stocks that are safe bets. To this end, we recommend stocks like <strong>Alcoa Corp </strong>AA, <strong>Noble Corporation Plc</strong> NE, <strong>Nextracker</strong> NXT, <strong>The Greenbrier Companies</strong> GBX and <strong>EZCORP </strong>EZPW. These stocks bear low leverage and, therefore, should be a safer option for investors if they don&rsquo;t want to lose big in times of market turmoil.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let&rsquo;s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.</p><h2>What&rsquo;s the Significance of Low-Leverage Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to excessive debt financing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The equity market can be volatile at times, and, as an investor, if you don&rsquo;t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks that bear low leverage and are, hence, less risky.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears. The debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.</p><h2>Analyzing Debt/Equity</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Debt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders&rsquo; Equity</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the fourth-quarter 2024 earnings season in its mid-way, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.</p><h2>The Winning Strategy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Considering the factors above, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.</p><h2>Here are the other parameters:</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median</strong>: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Current Price greater than or equal to 10</strong>: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000</strong>: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median</strong>: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock&rsquo;s price appreciation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>VGM Score of A or B</strong>: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5</strong>: This shows earnings growth expectation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Zacks Rank #1 or 2</strong>: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Alcoa Corp</strong>.: It is a global industry leader in bauxite, alumina and aluminum products. On Jan. 22, 2025, the company reported results for the fourth quarter of 2024. AA&rsquo;s adjusted earnings per share grew 82.5% year over year, while its fourth-quarter revenues improved 20%.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AA&rsquo;s 2025 sales suggests a 13.2% improvement from 2024 actuals.

It currently has a Zacks Rank #2.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Noble Corporation</strong>: It is an offshore drilling contractor in the oil and gas industry.

<![CDATA[ ROKU Exceeds $1B Mark in Q4 Platform Revenues: Time to Buy the Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:38:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Roku, Inc.</strong> ROKU delivered a stellar fourth-quarter 2024 results, marking a significant milestone as Platform revenues grew 25% year over year to $1.035 billion. This marks Roku&#39;s first-ever quarter exceeding the billion-dollar threshold for its high-margin Platform segment, demonstrating the company&#39;s successful strategy of monetizing its growing user base through advertising and content distribution.<br /><br />The company reported narrower-than-expected losses and impressive revenue growth, prompting investors to send shares soaring 13% in after-hours trading following the announcement.&nbsp;<br /><br />Roku reported a loss of 24 cents per share in the fourth quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 44 cents. The company had incurred a loss of 55 cents loss in the same quarter last year. Total revenues climbed 22% year over year to $1.2 billion, beating the consensus mark by 4.48%.<br /><br />With the stock already up 42.5% in the past year, many analysts are asking: is it the right time to buy Roku shares?</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">1-Year Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/99/94433.jpg?v=107397839" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Growing User Base and Engagement Metrics of ROKU</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Roku ended 2024 with 89.8 million streaming households globally, adding 4.3 million in the fourth quarter alone and 9.8 million for the full year. The company passed the 90 million milestone in early January 2025, and management anticipates continued strong growth both domestically and internationally.<br /><br />Streaming hours, a key performance indicator of user engagement, increased 18% year over year to 34.1 billion hours in the fourth quarter. For full-year 2024, streaming hours reached 127.1 billion, up 21.1 billion hours compared to 2023.<br /><br />The Roku Channel, the company&#39;s ad-supported streaming service, continues to be a standout performer with streaming hours up 82% year over year. It now reaches U.S. households with approximately 145 million people and remains the #3 app on the Roku platform by both reach and engagement.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Diversified Revenue Streams Bolster Roku&rsquo;s Growth Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Roku&#39;s three-pronged strategy to grow Platform revenues is clearly working. First, the company is effectively leveraging its Home Screen, which serves as the lead-in to TV for U.S. households with more than 125 million people daily. Second, Roku is expanding third-party platform integrations to drive advertising demand. Third, the company is growing subscription revenues through both premium and direct-to-consumer subscriptions.<br /><br />The advertising business performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter, even excluding political ad spending, which represented approximately 6% of Platform revenues. The company is successfully diversifying its advertising base beyond traditional media and entertainment companies, with retail, automotive and other verticals showing strong growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ROKU Positive Financial Trajectory for 2025 and Beyond</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2025, Roku expects total net revenues of $4.61 billion, representing 12% year-over-year growth. Platform revenues are anticipated to reach $3.95 billion, growing 12% year over year. Excluding political ad spending, this represents 15% growth, slightly above the 2024 rate.<br /><br />Perhaps most importantly, Roku projects Adjusted EBITDA of $350 million for 2025, a 35% increase from 2024, demonstrating improving profitability as the company scales. Management has also provided a clear path to operating income positivity in 2026, a significant milestone for long-term investors.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues is pegged at $4.61 billion, suggesting 12.19% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate is pegged at a loss of 80 cents per share. The company had incurred a loss of 89 cents per share in the year-ago period.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ec/94434.jpg?v=700765071" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar</strong></em>.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Challenges and Concerns for ROKU</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The streaming market is becoming increasingly crowded, with major players like <strong>Netflix</strong> NFLX, <strong>Disney</strong> DIS-owned Disney+ and <strong>Amazon</strong> AMZN Prime Video continually expanding their offerings. This intensifying competition raises questions about Roku&#39;s ability to maintain its growth trajectory.&nbsp;<br /><br />Additionally, Roku&#39;s stock might be considered expensive relative to its cash flow generation and industry peers, which could be a concern for investors focused on finding undervalued stocks. Roku&rsquo;s two-year price-to-cash flow ratio of 89.92X is ahead of the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry average of 30.4X.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Roku&rsquo;s Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/e4/94435.jpg?v=1906692068" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Investment Thesis: Why Roku Looks Attractive for 2025</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Roku presents a compelling investment opportunity for 2025 based on several fundamental strengths. The company has firmly established itself as the market leader in streaming, maintaining the #1 position by hours streamed across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Its impressive penetration of over half of U.S. broadband households provides a robust foundation for continued growth. This market dominance gives Roku significant leverage in negotiations with content providers and advertisers alike.<br /><br />The company&#39;s financial trajectory is equally promising, with Platform gross margins expected to hold steady between 52-53% in 2025. Management has demonstrated strong fiscal discipline by projecting only mid-single-digit growth in operating expenses while still investing strategically in growth initiatives. This balanced approach should accelerate the path toward sustainable profitability, with operating income positivity targeted for 2026.<br /><br />Roku&#39;s capital efficiency is another attractive element for potential investors. Management anticipates that free cash flow will exceed Adjusted EBITDA in 2025, providing the company with the flexibility to reinvest in the business, explore strategic acquisitions, or potentially return capital to shareholders in the future. This strong cash generation capability distinguishes Roku from many growth-oriented technology companies that struggle with cash burn even during expansion phases.<br /><br />The international growth story further enhances Roku&#39;s investment appeal. While already dominant in North America, the company is methodically expanding its footprint in Latin America and the United Kingdom. These markets represent significant long-term growth opportunities as global streaming adoption continues to accelerate.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">With streaming adoption continuing to accelerate globally and Roku positioning itself at the center of the streaming ecosystem, the company appears well-positioned to capitalize on both advertising and subscription revenue opportunities.

<![CDATA[ Novavax to Report Q4 Earnings: Here's What You Can Expect ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:36:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Novavax </strong>NVAX is expected to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings later this month. In the last reported quarter, the company&rsquo;s earnings beat estimates by 12.64%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $90.72 million, while that for earnings is pinned at a loss of 67 cents per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks </em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar </em></strong><strong><em>to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Shaping NVAX&rsquo;s Upcoming Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Although Novavax secured the FDA&rsquo;s authorization for an updated version of its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine toward the end of August, it was delayed compared to the approvals/authorizations granted to mRNA-based vaccines marketed by rivals Pfizer and Moderna. This earlier head-start is likely to have benefited both mRNA-based vaccines. Also, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines hold an edge over NVAX&rsquo;s vaccine. The mRNA-based vaccines have been designed to target the virus&rsquo;s KP.2 strain, which is a more advanced strain compared to JN.1, which the Novavax vaccine is designed to target.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the above factors, we expect minimal vaccine sales for the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for product sales is pegged at $82 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In December, Novavax announced that it has started dosing participants in a phase III study evaluating its experimental COVID-19-influenza combination (CIC) and stand-alone influenza vaccine candidates. The study will compare the immunogenicity and safety of the CIC vaccine with separate administrations of Novavax&rsquo;s currently authorized COVID-19 vaccine and a licensed seasonal influenza vaccine. It is also assessing the immunogenicity and safety of the standalone influenza vaccine. Investors will likely be interested in seeking updates from management on this study&rsquo;s progress.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We also expect management to provide an update on the technology transfer related to the company&rsquo;s COVID-19 vaccine to pharma giant <strong>Sanofi </strong>SNY. Per the company&rsquo;s recently signed multi-billion dollar deal, SNY assumed commercial responsibility for marketing the COVID-19 vaccine starting Jan. 1, 2025. The deal terms also allow Sanofi to use this vaccine to develop novel COVID-19-influenza combination vaccines.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors would also seek an update from Novavax on the progress of its preclinical pipeline, which includes vaccines for RSV and H5N1 bird flu. Novavax is also advancing core technology for different uses,like mucosal vaccination and high-density nanoparticles. Management intends to focus on exploring RSV-combination options and new opportunities in diseases like varicella-zoster virus (shingles) and Clostridium difficile (C. Diff.) colitis. It is also planning to expand into the field of oncology.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">NVAX&rsquo;s Earnings Surprise History</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The biotech firm&rsquo;s earnings missed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and met once, delivering a trailing four-quarter average negative surprise of 56.95%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Novavax, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Novavax, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="278" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/c6/1739966753.png" title="" width="561" /> <p>Novavax, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Novavax, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Novavax&rsquo;s shares have risen 3% year to date compared with the industry&rsquo;s 5% growth.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d3/94431.jpg?v=141124620" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What Our Model Predicts for NVAX</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Novavax this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the oddsof an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&#39;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Novavax has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some biotech stocks that have the right combination of elements to beat onearnings in the next quarter:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>argenx </strong>ARGX has an Earnings ESP of +34.55% and a Zacks Rank #1 at present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ARGX&rsquo;s shares have gained about 4% year to date. argenx beat on earnings in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark on the other two occasions, delivering an average surprise of 339.37%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TG Therapeutics </strong>TGTX has an Earnings ESP of +58.54% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date, TGTX&rsquo;s shares have risen nearly 4%.

<![CDATA[ Texas Instruments Down 6% in 3 Months: Buy, Hold or Sell the Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Texas Instruments Incorporated</strong> TXN has had a rough three months, with its stock declining 7.3% and underperforming the Zacks Semiconductor &ndash; General industry. It has also lagged behind major semiconductor players such as <strong>Micron Technology</strong> MU, <strong>Marvell Technology</strong> MRVL and <strong>Broadcom</strong> AVGO. This underperformance is largely due to weaker demand in its key industrial and automotive markets, pressure on margins and elevated capital expenditures.</p><h3>Three-Month Price Return Performance</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/16/94453.jpg?v=1327305847" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite these challenges, TXN remains one of the strongest long-term semiconductor plays, thanks to its dominance in analog and embedded processing, shareholder-friendly capital return policies and strategic investments in advanced manufacturing capacity. While near-term headwinds persist, holding the stock remains the best approach for now.</p><h2>TXN&rsquo;s Revenue Growth Faces Short-Term Challenges</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Texas Instruments&rsquo; fourth-quarter 2024 revenues came in at $4.01 billion, which slightly beat expectations but still reflected a 1.72% year-over-year decline. The company&rsquo;s earnings per share (EPS) of $1.30 also exceeded estimates, but semiconductor demand remains weak, particularly in industrial and automotive markets, which make up 70% of total revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the fourth quarter, industrial revenues declined by a low-single-digit percentage sequentially, while automotive revenues fell by a mid-single-digit percentage. Management&rsquo;s guidance for the first-quarter 2025 revenues of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion suggests another 3% sequential decline, reinforcing concerns about short-term demand weakness.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While these numbers indicate continued softness in Texas Instruments&rsquo; key segments, they also reflect the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. The long-term demand for power management, factory automation and electric vehicles (EVs) remains intact, making TXN well-positioned for future recovery.</p><h2>Technical Weakness Suggests Near-Term Pressure on TXN Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">From a technical standpoint, TXN stock is trading below its 50-day moving average, which is often seen as a bearish signal. This suggests that short-term downward pressure could continue, particularly if broader semiconductor weakness persists.</p><h3>50-Day Moving Average Signals Bearish Trend</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/61/94457.jpg?v=2128615039" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, investors should look beyond short-term technical trends. TXN&rsquo;s long-term fundamentals remain solid, and a rebound is likely once demand in industrial and automotive markets stabilizes.</p><h2>Industrial &amp; Automotive Segments to Fuel TXN&rsquo;s Future Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the current softness, Texas Instruments&rsquo; focus on industrial and automotive markets remains its biggest long-term strength. These sectors require longer product lifecycles and more stable demand compared to consumer electronics, making TXN&rsquo;s revenue base less volatile over time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Texas Instruments sees secular growth opportunities in factory automation, robotics and energy infrastructure, all of which are becoming more reliant on high-performance analog and embedded processing chips. Meanwhile, the automotive segment &mdash; despite a mid-single-digit decline in the fourth quarter &mdash; remains a key driver of future growth, particularly as EV adoption and demand for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) accelerate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While current industrial and automotive demand remains weak, Texas Instruments&rsquo; positioning in these markets ensures it will benefit from the next semiconductor upcycle, expected in late 2025 or early 2026.</p><h2>Capacity Expansion to Strengthen TXN&rsquo;s Competitive Edge</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Texas Instruments is nearing the completion of its six-year capital expenditure (CapEx) cycle, which has focused on expanding low-cost 300mm wafer fabrication capacity. This investment is a strategic move to reduce long-term production costs and strengthen margins.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s new fabrication facilities in Texas and Utah will allow Texas Instruments to increase production at a lower cost, reducing dependence on external suppliers. While the near-term impact on margins is negative due to high CapEx spending, these investments will ultimately enhance TXN&rsquo;s competitive position and improve long-term profitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Texas Instruments secured $1.6 billion in CHIPS Act grants to support its expansion, with total funding expected to reach $7.5 billion to $9.5 billion over the coming years. This will offset some capital expenses and further strengthen its cost advantage.</p><h2>Strong Shareholder Returns Make TXN a Stable Hold</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite ongoing industry headwinds, Texas Instruments remains one of the most shareholder-friendly semiconductor companies. In 2024, TXN increased its dividend by 5% for the 21st consecutive year, underscoring its commitment to returning capital to investors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Texas Instruments returned $5.7 billion to shareholders in 2024 through dividends and stock buybacks, reinforcing its reputation as a reliable income-generating stock. Additionally, TXN generated $6.32 billion in operating cash flow, providing a solid foundation to sustain its dividend and buyback programs even during industry downturns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This focus on consistent capital returns makes TXN an attractive stock to hold, particularly for long-term dividend investors.</p><h2>TXN&rsquo;s Valuation is Becoming More Attractive</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Texas Instruments currently trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.93, slightly below the industry average of 35.54.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While this suggests that Texas Instruments is not significantly undervalued, its stock is now cheaper relative to its historical valuation range. Investors looking for a strong semiconductor stock with long-term stability may find TXN more attractive at these levels.</p><h3>Forward 12-Month P/E Ratio</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/36/94459.jpg?v=699073445" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Conclusion: Hold TXN Stock for Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Texas Instruments&rsquo; 7.3% decline over the past three months reflects short-term semiconductor industry challenges, but it does not change the company&rsquo;s strong long-term fundamentals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With a dominant position in analog and embedded processing, a disciplined capacity expansion strategy and a commitment to shareholder returns, TXN remains one of the best-positioned semiconductor stocks for long-term growth. However, with near-term demand still weak and CapEx spending weighing on margins, the immediate upside may be limited.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For now, investors should hold Texas Instruments stock, waiting for either a better buying opportunity or clearer signs of an industry recovery before adding more exposure. Currently, TXN carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ 5 Best Stocks Powering S&P 500 ETF Midway in Q1 ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>After a stellar 2024, the S&amp;P 500 has been on a bullish trend this year, too. The benchmark hit a new all-time high on Feb. 18. A combination of strong economic indicators, sector diversification, advancements in AI and solid corporate earnings season are driving the rally amid global trade war fears and uncertainty about the Fed&#39;s future rate cut plans (read: ETF Investors Crown a New King). &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust</strong> SPY, the proxy version of the S&amp;P 500 Index, has gained 4% since the start of the year. While many stocks powered the ETF, we have highlighted five that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold). These are <strong>Palantir Technologies Inc. </strong>PLTR, <strong>CVS Health Corporation</strong> CVS, <strong>Constellation Energy Corporation </strong>CEG, <strong>Intel Corporation</strong> INTC and <strong>Tapestry Inc </strong>TPR. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The U.S. economy has demonstrated robust growth, bolstered by strong consumer confidence, declining unemployment rates, rising wages and positive manufacturing surveys. The rally has now broadened beyond the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; to other sectors like financials and industrials.&nbsp;<br /><br />Significant investments in AI and related technologies have spurred optimism about future productivity gains and economic expansion. Companies are allocating substantial capital toward AI, anticipating long-term benefits that justify current valuations.<br /><br />Further, this reporting cycle has been a good one, with the growth pace showing a notable accelerating trend and companies comfortably beating consensus estimates. Total earnings for 74% of the S&amp;P 500 are up 12.1% from the same period last year on 5.6% higher revenues, with 77.8% beating EPS estimates and 64.6% beating revenue estimates. This is notably a better performance relative to other recent periods, particularly in terms of the growth pace.<br /><br />The Fed kept the key interest rate steady in its last meeting following a series of rate cuts since September 2024. The central bank has signaled it&rsquo;s in no rush to lower interest rates further as inflation remains elevated. This reflects looming concerns over future inflation and uncertainty about Trump&rsquo;s trade tariff policies.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.&nbsp;</p><h2>SPY in Focus</h2><p>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 8% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, financials, consumer discretionary and healthcare accounting for a double-digit allocation each.&nbsp;<br /><br />SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust has an AUM of $633.1 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. It trades in an average daily volume of 40 million shares and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).<br /><br />Below, we have highlighted the abovementioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.</p><h2>Best-Performing Stocks of SPY</h2><p><strong>Palantir Technologies</strong> builds and deploys software platforms for the intelligence community, principally in the United States. The stock has soared about 65% since the start of the year and accounts for a 0.5% share in the SPY portfolio.&nbsp;<br /><br />Palantir Technologies has an estimated earnings growth rate of 31.7% for 2025 and a Zacks Rank #2. It has a Growth Score of B.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>CVS Health</strong> (formerly known as CVS Caremark) is a pharmacy innovation company with integrated offerings across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care. The stock has jumped 46% since the start of 2025 and has an estimated earnings growth of 7.9% for this year.&nbsp;<br /><br />CVS Health makes up 0.16% of the assets in SPY and currently has a Zacks Rank #3. It has a Value Score of A.<br /><br /><strong>Constellation Energy</strong> provides electric power, natural gas and energy management services to 2 million customers across the continental United States. The stock has soared 45.5% so far this year and makes up 0.19% of the assets in the SPY portfolio.&nbsp;<br /><br />Constellation Energy has an expected earnings growth rate of 68.3% for this year and a Zacks Rank #2.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Intel</strong>, the world&rsquo;s largest semiconductor company and the primary supplier of microprocessors and chipsets, is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by moving into data-centric businesses &mdash; such as AI and autonomous driving. The stock accounts for a 0.20% share in the ETF and has risen 36.6% so far this year.<br /><br />Intel has an estimated earnings growth rate of 492.3% for this year and a Zacks Rank #3 (read: ETFs in Focus Post Intel&#39;s Q4 Earnings Beat).<br /><br /><strong>Tapestry</strong>, which was formerly known as Coach, is the designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men in the United States and internationally. The stock has gained 36.2% since the start of the year and has an estimated earnings growth of 14.4% for the fiscal year (ending June 2025).<br /><br />Tapestry accounts for 0.04% of SPY&#39;s assets. It currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417884/5-best-stocks-powering-s-p-500-etf-midway-in-q1?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2417884">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ ACGL Trading at a Premium to Industry: How Should You Play the Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>Arch Capital Group Ltd.</strong> ACGL are trading at a premium to the Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry. Its price-to-book value of 1.66X is higher than the industry average of 1.63X. It has a Value Score of B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/17/94421.jpg?v=1573905499" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>The Travelers Companies, Inc</strong>. TRV are also trading at a multiple higher than the industry average, while <strong>NMI Holdings Inc</strong> NMIH and <strong>Cincinnati Financial Corporation</strong> CINF shares are trading at a discount.<br /><br />Arch Capital shares have gained 3.5% in the past year, underperforming its industry, the Finance sector, as well the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s return.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">ACGL Price performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ab/94422.jpg?v=1861532382" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">With a market capitalization of $33.24 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.2 million.<br /><br />Closing at $88.33 on Tuesday, the stock stands 24% below its 52-week high of $116.47. The stock is trading below the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) of $92.95 and $100.44, respectively, indicating downward momentum. SMA is a widely used technical analysis tool to predict future price trends by analyzing historical price data.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Return on Capital of ACGL</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Arch Capital&rsquo;s trailing 12-month return on equity is 17.9%, ahead of the industry average of 7.6%. Return on equity, a profitability measure, reflects how effectively a company is utilizing its shareholders.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, the return on invested capital in the trailing 12 months was 6.9%, better than the industry average of 5.8%. This reflects the company&rsquo;s efficiency in utilizing funds to generate income.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ACGL Growth Projection</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Arch Capital&rsquo;s 2025 revenues is pegged at $18.84 billion, implying a year-over-year improvement of 13.3%.&nbsp;<br /><br />The consensus estimate for 2026 earnings per share and revenues indicates a year-over-year increase of 13.8% and 8.4%, respectively, from the corresponding 2024 estimates. Earnings have grown 33.5% in the past five years, better than the industry average of 19.3%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Surprise History</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Arch Capital surpassed earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 15.53%.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Favoring Arch Capital</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Widespread operations, coupled with a compelling product portfolio provide meaningful diversification and earnings stability to ACGL. These also enable international expansion, enhance operations and diversify business at attractive risk-adjusted returns through strategic buyouts.<br /><br />Its Mortgage Insurance complements the specialty insurance and reinsurance businesses. ACGL&rsquo;s buyout of Allianz&rsquo;s U.S. MidCorp and Entertainment insurance business has expanded its footprint in the middle-market property and casualty segment.<br /><br />A growing base of invested assets, driven by improving cash flows, should drive investment income.<br /><br />Sufficient liquidity, coupled with low leverage, has helped ACGL strengthen its balance. It also shields it from market volatility and supports growth initiatives.&nbsp;<br />Notably, its free cash flow conversion has remained more than 85% over the last many quarters, reflecting its solid earnings.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Wrapping Up: Keep On Holding</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Arch Capital boasts a strong product portfolio and has a solid track record of premium growth, as well as favorable return on capital. Both the Insurance and Reinsurance segments should continue to witness significant growth from increases in most lines of business. A robust capital position over the years reflects its financial flexibility.<br /><br />Given the premium valuation, it is better to stay cautious about this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

<![CDATA[ Micron Stock Soars 26% YTD: Should You Buy More or Book Profits? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Micron Technology, Inc.</strong> MU has been on a strong rally in 2025, with its stock soaring 26.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the Zacks Computer &ndash; Integrated Systems industry and major semiconductor players like <strong>NVIDIA Corporation</strong> NVDA, <strong>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.</strong> AMD and <strong>Broadcom Inc.</strong> AVGO. This impressive surge has been fueled by AI-driven demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and positive news surrounding its strategic partnerships.</p><h3>YTD Price Return Performance</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fa/94440.jpg?v=349035289" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, short-term risks &mdash; including margin contraction, weakening consumer demand and geopolitical uncertainties &mdash; suggest that now may be the right time to book profits rather than chase further upside. Despite the long-term potential, Micron&rsquo;s near-term challenges could lead to volatility, making selling the stock a prudent move for now.</p><h2>Micron&rsquo;s AI Tailwinds Have Driven the Rally</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Micron&rsquo;s rally has been fueled by multiple positive catalysts, particularly in the AI and HBM markets. A major boost came from NVIDIA&rsquo;s announcement during CES 2025, confirming Micron as a key supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs. This partnership solidified Micron&rsquo;s positioning in the HBM market, driving increased investor confidence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Micron revealed plans for a new HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore, set to begin operations in 2026 with further expansions by 2027. This move aligns with Micron&rsquo;s AI-driven growth strategy, ensuring diversified supply chains and increased packaging capacity for high-performance memory chips.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While these announcements bolstered sentiment, the stock&rsquo;s rally now appears stretched, and recent warnings from Micron&rsquo;s management on margin pressures raise concerns about near-term profitability.</p><h2>Micron&rsquo;s Q3 Margin Warning Raises Red Flags</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite maintaining its second-quarter fiscal 2025 guidance, Micron&rsquo;s CFO Mark Murphy recently cautioned that third-quarter gross margins would decline by several hundred basis points sequentially. This caught analysts off guard, as they had previously anticipated stable margins.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expected margin contraction is driven by a shift toward lower-priced consumer products and underutilization of NAND production capacity. While Micron is optimistic about long-term demand, lower profitability in the near term makes the stock less attractive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Reflecting these concerns, analysts have already started lowering their earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter EPS was revised downward by 4 cents to $1.54, while full-year EPS projections for fiscal 2025 were cut from $6.90 to $6.83 over the past week. If margin pressure persists, further downward revisions could weigh on the stock.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/4d/94441.jpg?v=547507579" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the near-term profitability concerns, Micron has a strong history of beating earnings estimates. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 72.3%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><h2> <img alt="Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/10/1739968948.png" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" title="" /> </h2><p>Micron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2>Weak Consumer Demand Poses a Major Risk for Micron</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond AI and data centers, Micron&rsquo;s business is still significantly tied to traditional consumer markets, including personal computers (PCs) and smartphones, both of which are seeing sluggish demand recovery.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Micron&rsquo;s Embedded Business Unit, which includes mobile memory, saw revenues decline 10% sequentially. The company expects low-single-digit growth in smartphone shipments and mid-single-digit growth in PC sales for 2025. These weak projections suggest that a full recovery in Micron&rsquo;s consumer-driven segments is still far off, limiting the upside for its DRAM and NAND sales.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, major PC manufacturers are adjusting their memory purchases downward in response to softening consumer demand, which could weigh on Micron&rsquo;s revenue growth in the coming quarters.</p><h2>Geopolitical Tensions Remain a Major Threat for Micron</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">One of the biggest risks looming over Micron is its exposure to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. The U.S. government, along with Japan and the Netherlands, has placed increasing restrictions on China&rsquo;s ability to develop advanced semiconductors, and China has retaliated by limiting business with certain U.S. chipmakers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Micron generates approximately 11% of its total revenues from China, making it particularly vulnerable to any escalation in trade tensions. If China further restricts U.S. chip imports, Micron could see a meaningful revenue hit, putting additional pressure on its financial performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While Micron has attempted to diversify its supply chain, these geopolitical headwinds remain an unpredictable and uncontrollable risk, making the stock inherently more volatile than some of its peers.</p><h2>Conclusion: Sell Micron Stock for Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Micron&rsquo;s 26.5% YTD rally has been impressive, but the stock now faces multiple near-term risks that could limit further upside. Margin contraction, weakening consumer demand and geopolitical uncertainties all present serious headwinds, making it a good time to lock in profits before potential downside materializes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While Micron&rsquo;s long-term AI-driven growth prospects remain promising, short-term fundamentals suggest that the stock is overextended. Selling the stock now and waiting for a better re-entry point after a potential pullback is the most prudent strategy. Currently, MU carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417862/micron-stock-soars-26-ytd-should-you-buy-more-or-book-profits?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2417862">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ HALO's Q4 Earnings Beat, Higher Royalties Drive Revenue Growth ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 14:20:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Halozyme Therapeutics</strong> HALO reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $1.26 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16. The company had recorded adjusted earnings of 82 cents per share in the year-ago period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues in the fourth quarter increased 30% year over year to $298 million. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $284 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The top-line growth was primarily driven by higher royalty payments from <strong>Roche</strong> RHHBY for Phesgo and <strong>J&amp;J</strong> JNJ for subcutaneous Darzalex (daratumumab) as well as an increase in milestone revenues during the quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Several companies use HALO&rsquo;s Enhanze technology to develop a subcutaneous formulation of their currently marketed drugs. Halozyme now has several marketed partnered drugs based on this technology, including the subcutaneous formulation of J&amp;J&rsquo;s Darzalex and Roche&rsquo;s Phesgo.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Halozyme were up 1.9% in after-hours trading on Feb 18, owing to the better-than-expected results.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past year, shares of Halozyme have rallied 60.8% against the industry&rsquo;s decline of 8.5%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9c/94401.jpg?v=471762300" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">More on HALO&#39;s Q4 Earnings</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Halozyme&rsquo;s top line comprises product sales, royalties and revenues under collaborative agreements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Royalty revenues totaled $170.4 million in the fourth quarter, up 40% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level. This was mainly due to the robust demand for Phesgo, subcutaneous Darzalex and Vyvgart Hytrulo on which it earns royalties. Royalty revenues beat our model estimate of $155.1 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Product sales were $79.4 million, almost in line with the year-ago quarter figure. HALO has two commercial proprietary products, Hylenex and Xyosted, with the latter acquired from Antares Pharma in 2022. Product sales beat our model estimate of $77 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues under collaborative agreements were $48.2 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 69.7% on a year-over-year basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted EBITDA was $195.8 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 60.9% increase from the prior-year quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Halozyme had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $596.1 million as of Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $666.3 million as of Sept. 30, 2024.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">HALO&#39;s Full-Year Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2024, Halozyme generated revenues of $1.02 billion, reflecting a 22% increase year over year. This is the first time that the company has managed to breach the $1 billion mark in total revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the same period, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.23 per share, up from earnings of $2.77 per share in the year-ago period.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">HALO&#39;s 2025 Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reiterated its total revenue guidance for 2025, which it had provided last month.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues are expected in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.22 billion in 2025, implying year-over-year growth of 13% to 21%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues are expected to grow on increased royalty revenues due to the continued strong growth of JNJ&rsquo;s Darzalex SC and RHHBY&rsquo;s Phesgo and higher product sales from Xyosted.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Royalty revenues are anticipated in the range of $725-$750 million, implying year-over-year growth of 27% to 31%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted EBITDA is expected in the band of $755-$805 million, implying year-over-year growth of 19% to 27%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of $4.95-$5.35 per share in 2025, implying growth of 17% to 26% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">HALO&rsquo;s earnings per share guidance does not consider the impact of potential future share repurchases.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.

Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">HALO&#39;s Zacks Rank &amp; A Stock to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Halozyme currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A top-ranked stock in this space is <strong>Pacira BioSciences, Inc.</strong> PCRX, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, estimates for Pacira BioSciences&rsquo; earnings per share have increased from $2.79 to $3.46 for 2025. In the past year, shares of PCRX have decreased 9.1%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PCRX&rsquo;s earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met the same once and missed the same on the remaining occasion, the average surprise being 7.13%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417859/halo-s-q4-earnings-beat-higher-royalties-drive-revenue-growth?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2417859">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

The company&rsquo;s quarterly results are likely to display revenue growth, while adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share may decline year over year.</p><p><strong><em>See the Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;to stay ahead of market-making news</em></strong>.</p><p>In the last reported quarter, this Boca Raton, FL-based communications tower REIT reported an AFFO per share of $3.32, which met the Zacks Consensus Estimate.&nbsp; Results reflected a marginal improvement in domestic cash site-leasing revenues due to increased carrier activity. However, lower revenues clocked by site development hurt the results to some extent.</p><p>Over the preceding four quarters, SBAC&rsquo;s AFFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions, met once and missed in the remaining period, with the average beat being 0.38%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>SBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="SBA Communications Corporation Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/15/1739969842.png" title="" width="538" /> <p>SBA Communications Corporation price-eps-surprise | SBA Communications Corporation Quote</p></div><h2>Factors at Play for SBA Communications</h2><p>With increasing smartphone adoption, greater broadband demand and plans for 5G service worldwide, wireless service providers and carriers have been deploying additional equipment for existing networks to enhance network coverage and capacity. This has been spurring the demand for SBA Communications&rsquo; wireless communications infrastructure, which might have benefited its fourth-quarter performance favorably.</p><p>Moreover,the company&rsquo;s resilient and stable site-leasing business model and portfolio expansion moves, domestically and internationally, to capitalize on the industry&rsquo;s secular trends are encouraging.</p><p>However, the ongoing consolidation in the wireless industry is likely to have impacted the company&rsquo;s fourth-quarter performance. High interest expenses and elevated churn in certain markets where the company operates might have been other deterrents to some extent.</p><h2>Projections for SBA Communications</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter site-leasing revenues, which account for the lion&rsquo;s share of total revenues, is pegged at $639.2 million, indicating a marginal increase from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s $636.1 million. Site-development revenues are also expected to be marginally higher in the fourth quarter, with the consensus mark estimated at $39.7 million, up from $38.9 million reported in the year-ago period.</p><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total quarterly revenues is pegged at $681.7 million, indicating an increase of 1% year over year.</p><p>The company&rsquo;s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to garner analysts&rsquo; confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly AFFO per share has been revised southward at $3.36 over the past week. The figure implies a&nbsp;marginal year-over-year decline.</p><p>For full-year 2024, SBAC expected its AFFO per share in the band of $13.20-$13.45, site-leasing revenues in the band of $2,520-$2,530 million, site-development revenues in the range of $140-$150 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1,890-$1,900 million.</p><p>For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AFFO per share stands at $13.24, indicating a 0.46% increase year over year. For full-year 2024, the consensus estimate for revenues stands at $2.67 billion, suggesting a decline of 1.62% year over year.</p><h2>What Our Quantitative Model Predicts for SBA Communications</h2><p>Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of AFFO per share for SBA Communications this season. The combination of a positive&nbsp;Earnings ESP&nbsp;and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an AFFO beat, which is not the case here.</p><p>SBA Communications currently has an Earnings ESP of -2.38% and a Zacks Rank of 3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our&nbsp;Earnings ESP Filter.</p><h2>Stocks That Warrant a Look</h2><p>Here are two stocks from the broader REIT sector &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>Gaming and Leisure Properties </strong>GLPI and&nbsp;<strong>Ryman Hospitality Properties </strong>RHP&mdash; that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.</p><p>Gaming and Leisure Properties, scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Feb. 20, has an Earnings ESP of +0.83% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p>Ryman Hospitality Properties is slated to report quarterly numbers on Feb. 20. It has an Earnings ESP of +4.91% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3 at present.</p><p>Note:&nbsp;<em>Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417854/what-s-in-the-cards-for-sba-communications-this-earnings-season?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2417854">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ CSCO's Prospects Ride on Strong AI Push: Should You Buy the Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:59:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cisco Systems</strong> CSCO is riding on strong demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure products, with orders worth more than $700 million at the end of the first half of fiscal 2025. CSCO remains on track to surpass $1 billion in AI infrastructure orders in fiscal 2025.&nbsp;<br /><br />Cisco is benefiting from an innovative portfolio. AI-based enterprises have been signing deals to buy integrated systems, including Nexus, UCS and additional solutions to power AI applications. The <strong>NVIDIA</strong> NVDA-based CSCO AI POD product, which comprises hardware and software, is gaining traction. The launch of 800 gig Nexus switches based on Cisco&rsquo;s 51.2 terabit Silicon One chip in April is expected to drive orders from AI-based cloud customers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Increasing deployment of AI-powered robotics and industrial security bodes well for CSCO&rsquo;s industrial Internet-of-Things business. In the first half of fiscal 2025, orders grew more than 40%, with growth of over 50% in the recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2025 alone. Cisco&rsquo;s security orders more than doubled in the fiscal second quarter, driven by the advanced data management, analytics and threat detection capabilities of Splunk. Strong demand for its refreshed firewall solution has been a key catalyst.<br /><br />Overall, product orders jumped 29% year over year (11% organically excluding Splunk) in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Annualized Recurring Revenues (ARR) were $30.1 billion, up 22% on a year-over-year basis, with product ARR growth of 41%. Remaining performance obligations at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were $41.3 billion, up 16% year over year, reflecting strong prospects.</p><h2>CSCO&rsquo;s Expanding AI Business to Drive Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Cisco is benefiting from an expanding portfolio, with the combination of Cisco 8K, Silicon One, optics and optical systems. These solutions are currently being deployed by five of the largest webscalers in their back-end training networks.<br /><br />Strong adoption of Nexus switches, AI servers, AI PODs, and Hyperfabric and AI Defense software is noteworthy. These solutions are designed to simplify and smoothen up AI infrastructure deployment.<br /><br />Cisco&rsquo;s strategy of infusing AI across Security and Collaboration platforms and developing Agentic capabilities across the portfolio is a key catalyst. It is leveraging Agentic AI to improve customer experience (CX). The launch of Renewals Agent, an Agentic AI-driven solution co-developed with Mistral, and a new Assistant to help customers digitize and de-risk Network Change Management have been noteworthy developments in this regard.<br /><br />The acquisition of Deeper Insights is noteworthy as it expands Cisco&rsquo;s CX AI capabilities and services.</p><h2>CSCO Benefits From Strong Security Offerings</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the second quarter fiscal 2025, security revenues jumped 117% year over year to $2.11 billion, driven by Splunk, SASE and Network Security.&nbsp;<br /><br />Cisco&rsquo;s security business is benefiting from strong demand for both Cisco Secure Access and XDR. On a combined basis, both solutions have gained more than 1,000 customers in the trailing 12 months, and each of the products roughly has one million enterprise users. Hypershield is also gaining traction.&nbsp;<br /><br />Cisco integrated Talos into Splunk&rsquo;s newly released Enterprise Security 8.0 solution and AppDynamics into Splunk&rsquo;s on-prem log observer in the fiscal second quarter. The company also launched Splunk on Azure, Splunk Federated Analytics, and AI Assistant for Splunk Observability.<br /><br />Its latest launch, Cisco AI Defense, enables and safeguards AI transformation within enterprises. With the exponential growth of AI, risks like data leaks, misuse of AI tools and sophisticated threats are also on the rise.

<![CDATA[ 3 Film & Television Production Stocks to Buy on Solid Industry Trends ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is witnessing a surge in demand for digital entertainment due to operational constraints faced by movie theaters, theme parks and cruise lines. This increased consumption of online media, music and news, driven by the work-and-learn-from-home trend, has been a boon for industry players like <strong>Live Nation Entertainment</strong> LYV, <strong>TKO Group Holdings, Inc.</strong> TKO and <strong>News Corporation </strong>NWSA. However, as more players enter the field, content costs are skyrocketing, putting pressure on profitability. This trend is forcing companies to spend heavily on original programming and exclusive rights to attract and retain viewers, which can strain financial resources and impact stock performance.</p><p><b>Industry Description</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry encompasses companies engaged in the creation, distribution and exhibition of film and television content. The core activities revolve around producing entertainment for theaters, television networks, video-on-demand platforms, streaming services and other outlets that showcase such works. A notable company like Imax specializes in advanced motion picture technologies and immersive presentation experiences. Industry participants are involved in the production and dissemination of movies destined for theatrical releases and direct-to-video markets, as well as television programming. The financial performance of these entities hinges greatly on the global box office success of their films, coupled with the number of new releases and the viewership ratings garnered by their television shows.</p><p><b>3 Film and Television Production Industry Trends in Focus</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Over-the-Top Services Gain Prominence</strong></em>: Content creators are increasingly distributing through over-the-top streaming services to capitalize on the popularity of their franchises. Their aim is to provide exclusive content and a differentiated viewing experience. However, streaming companies themselves are producing more original, award-winning programming to reduce licensing costs and reliance on third-party providers, which could undermine traditional content distribution strategies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Binge-Watching Drives Consumption</strong></em>: Phenomena like binge-watching, wider Internet adoption, and advancements in mobile, video and wireless technologies have led consumers to frequently view content on smaller screens. To adapt to these new viewing patterns, industry players are pivoting to digital content distribution. The rise of digital capabilities provides easier access to consumer data, allowing production companies to leverage AI tools for better understanding audience preferences and creating resonant content. However, intense competition from streamers is forcing increased spending on content and marketing, hurting profitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Technological Advancement Aids Prospects</strong></em>: Exhibitors are adopting highly efficient, cost-effective laser projection systems to enhance image quality and the overall movie experience. Technologies like motion seating, immersive audio, interactive movies, AR and VR are expected to further elevate the viewing experience. Conversely, the growth of alternative distribution channels like home video, pay-per-view, streaming, VOD, Internet and broadcast TV is challenging traditional exhibitors.</p><p><b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #32, which places it in the top 13% of more than 246 Zacks industries.<br /><br />The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.<br /><br />The industry&rsquo;s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential.<br /><br />Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let&rsquo;s take a look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.</p><p><b>Industry Outperforms the Sector, S&P 500</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.<br /><br />The industry has returned 42.7% in the abovementioned period compared with the broader sector&rsquo;s growth of 19.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has risen 24% during the same time frame.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One-Year Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/1yearperf_20250219.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /></p><p><b>Industry's Current Valuation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the basis of the trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S), a commonly used multiple for valuing Film and Television Production and Distribution stocks, the industry is currently trading at 2.36X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 6.02X and the sector&rsquo;s 2.4X.<br /><br />Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.53X and as low as 0.6X, recording a median of 1.62X, as the chart below shows.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Trailing 12-Month P/S Ratio</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/5yearval_20250219.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /></p><p><b>3 Film & Television Stocks to Buy Right Now</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Live Nation Entertainment</strong>: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company continues to demonstrate robust growth fundamentals across its ecosystem, making it an attractive buy opportunity for 2025. Following record concert profitability in 2024 with third-quarter AOI reaching $474 million (up 39% year over year) and margins expanding to an impressive 7.2%, the company is well-positioned for continued growth. Leading indicators are exceedingly positive with the 2025 large venue pipeline up double-digits versus 2024, including stadiums, arenas and amphitheaters. With more than 20 million tickets already sold for 2025 events (pacing up double-digits) and recent stadium shows delivering double-digit growth in gross revenues, Live Nation&#39;s core business is accelerating post-pandemic. <span style="pd4ml-display: none; pd4ml-visibility: hidden;"> You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. </span><br /><br />The company is strategically expanding its venue footprint, planning to add or refurbish 14 venues through 2025, increasing capacity by eight million fans. Ticket demand remains robust with global ticket sales in September/October up 20% year over year, while sponsorship commitments are pacing up double-digits for 2025. Management demonstrated prudent capital management with $5.5B billion in cash equivalents and $1.7 billion in free cash as of third-quarter 2024. With strong pricing power evidenced by premium offerings (VIP ticket revenue up 20%+ at major festivals), Live Nation has positioned itself to capture significant value from the continued growth in experiential entertainment spending.<br /><br />Live Nation Entertainment shares have gained 65.9% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has moved north by a penny to $2.45 per share over the past 30 days.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: LYV</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/lyv_20250219.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TKO Group Holdings</strong>: This Zacks Rank #2 company holds bright prospects in 2025 demonstrated by robust financial performance and strategic growth initiatives. In third-quarter 2024, the company reported $681.2 million in revenues (up 52% year over year) and adjusted EBITDA of $310 million (up 29%), prompting management to raise full-year guidance to the upper end of their $2.670-$2.745 billion revenue range. The company maintains strong cash generation with $457.4 million in cash and cash equivalents while demonstrating financial discipline through its Free Cash Flow Conversion target exceeding 40%. TKO&#39;s recently announced capital return program, including a $2 billion share repurchase plan and quarterly dividend program beginning March 2025, signals management&#39;s confidence and commitment to shareholder returns.<br /><br />Looking ahead, TKO is excellently positioned for sustained growth through its pending acquisition of Professional Bull Riders, On Location, and IMG in an all-equity transaction valued at $3.25 billion. This strategic expansion will enhance TKO&#39;s sports marketplace position, increase scale and accelerate shareholder returns. The combination of UFC and WWE continues to demonstrate synergistic benefits through cost reduction initiatives, evidenced by WWE&#39;s Adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 54% from 36% year over year. With strong brands reaching over one billion households globally and organizing more than 300 live events annually, TKO represents an attractive investment in the premium sports entertainment sector.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TKO&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has moved north by 1% to $3.15 per share over the past 30 days. TKO shares have surged 100.9% in the past year.</p><p><pd4ml:page.break></pd4ml:page.break></p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: TKO</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/tko_20250219.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>News Corporation</strong>: This Zacks Rank #2 company is a compelling investment opportunity in 2025, demonstrating robust financial performance and strategic execution. The company&rsquo;s second-quarter fiscal 2025 results showcase its strength with a 5% revenue increase to $2.24 billion, a remarkable 58% surge in net income from continuing operations to $306 million, and 20% growth in Total Segment EBITDA to $478 million. The company is successfully executing its digital transformation strategy, with its three core growth pillars &mdash; Digital Real Estate Services, Dow Jones, and Book Publishing &mdash; collectively expanding Segment EBITDA by 16%. The strategic sale of Foxtel to DAZN for A$3.4 billion (7x Foxtel&#39;s FY2024 EBITDA) strengthens the balance sheet while allowing management to focus on high-growth, high-margin businesses.<br /><br />News Corporation is exceptionally well-positioned in the evolving AI landscape, having secured valuable content partnerships with companies like OpenAI while vigorously protecting its intellectual property. With credit rating upgrades to investment grade from both S&amp;P Global and Moody&#39;s, the company maintains financial flexibility for both shareholder returns and strategic investments. Digital revenues now constitute 81% of Dow Jones revenues, while both REA Group and realtor.com demonstrate strong performance despite challenging housing markets. The company&#39;s diversified portfolio, deliberate simplification strategy, and increasing digital penetration make NWSA an attractive growth investment with significant upside potential through 2025.<br /><br />News Corporation shares have gained 15.1% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings has moved north by 9.3% to 94 cents per share over the past 30 days.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: NWSA</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/nwsa_20250219.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417700/3-film-television-production-stocks-to-buy-on-solid-industry-trends?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-industry_outlook-2417700">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ What's in Store for These Three Restaurant Stocks in Q4 Earnings? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant industry continues to navigate a dynamic environment shaped by digital transformation, shifting consumer preferences and economic headwinds. Companies in the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, such as <strong>Shake Shack Inc. </strong>SHAK, <strong>BJ&#39;s Restaurants, Inc.</strong> BJRI and <strong>Texas Roadhouse, Inc.</strong> TXRH, are set to report their fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 20.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant industry is likely to have experienced notable gains from marketing initiatives, service digitization, new store openings and menu offerings. Also, strategic investments in staffing and deployment, processes and algorithm technology bode well. Industry players are piloting a new in-store prioritization algorithm and exploring other technology investments to improve order sequencing and efficiency behind the counter. Also, refinement of pricing strategies and identification of key category pricing thresholds are likely to have positioned the respective company at the top of the consumer&#39;s consideration, thereby aiding its top line.<br /><br />However, companies continue to navigate several macroeconomic challenges that have influenced their performance. Global economic uncertainties, including shifts in consumer sentiment, are likely to have weighed on companies&rsquo; performance, particularly in regions affected by geopolitical conflicts. Pressure on spending persists, in particular, with two significant cohorts of consumer base, low-income and families, particularly in Europe. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates remain headwinds.<br /><br />Per the latest Earnings Outlook, total earnings of the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are expected to rise 23.6% year over year. In the third quarter of 2024, the sector&rsquo;s earnings were up 17% year over year. Meanwhile, revenues for the sector are expected to rise 4.6% year over year. In the previous quarter, the sector&rsquo;s revenues gained 5% year over year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Sneak Peek Into Upcoming Earnings Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Amid a number of stocks, to identify those with the potential to beat earnings estimates, the following Zacks methodology can be exercised. The Zacks model suggests that a company needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients &mdash; a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) &mdash; to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />Here are three bundled stocks that are set to report their fourth-quarter earnings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BJ&#39;s Restaurants</strong> is scheduled to report results after the closing bell.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>BJ&#39;s Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h2> <img alt="BJ's Restaurants, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/f5/1739966351.png" title="" width="533" /> <p>BJ&#39;s Restaurants, Inc. price-eps-surprise | BJ&#39;s Restaurants, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from solid Pizookie Meal Deal performance and loyalty program membership expansion. Also, higher guest traffic and average checks, resulting from menu price increases, changes in mix and a higher level of promotions are likely to have added to the positives. Cost-saving and margin expansion plans bode well.<br /><br />The company rolled out a specialized disposables distributor, for which it will begin to realize the full savings in the fourth quarter of 2024. However, increased food cost inflation and other related expenses like labor and benefits, along with uncertainty regarding discretionary spending, are likely to have negatively impacted the company&rsquo;s fourth-quarter bottom line.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BJRI&rsquo;s fourth-quarter 2024 revenues and earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $337.4 million and 35 cents, indicating growth of 4.3% and 2.9%, respectively, from the year-ago figures.<br /><br />The company has an Earnings ESP of -2.06% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Shake Shack</strong> is scheduled to report results before the opening bell.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Shake Shack, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h2> <img alt="Shake Shack, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/d0/1739966432.png" title="" width="537" /> <p>Shake Shack, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Shake Shack, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">SHAK&rsquo;s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from robust same-shack sales, digital initiatives and unit expansion. Also, the emphasis on innovative menu offerings, targeted promotions and expanded digital bodes well. In the first nine months of 2024, same-shack sales rose 3.4% year over year, driven by a 4.2% increase in price mix. It has also been making more investments in digitization to sustain its digital guest enhancement strategies.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s efforts to enhance guest engagement and brand visibility through effective marketing strategies are likely to have supported its performance in the fourth quarter. However, challenges with respect to rising beef costs and macroeconomic and geopolitical issues in licensed markets like China and the Middle East are likely to act as a headwind.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SHAK&rsquo;s fourth-quarter 2024 revenues and EPS is pegged at $328.6 million and 25 cents, indicating growth of 14.8% and 1,150%, respectively, from the year-ago figures.<br /><br />The company has an Earnings ESP of -0.29% and a Zacks Rank #2.<br /><br /><strong>Texas Roadhouse</strong> is scheduled to report results after the closing bell.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Texas Roadhouse, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h2> <img alt="Texas Roadhouse, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/48/1739966535.png" title="" width="538" /> <p>Texas Roadhouse, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Texas Roadhouse, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">TXRH is expected to maintain strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, supported by continued positive traffic trends. The company reported an 8.3% same-store sales increase in the first four weeks of the fourth quarter, reflecting sustained demand across its restaurants. This momentum follows an 8.5% comparable sales gain in the third quarter, driven by a mix of traffic growth and pricing adjustments.<br /><br />The additional 14th week in the fourth quarter (due to TXRH&rsquo;s 53-week fiscal year) is expected to boost overall revenues. Emphasis on the rollout of new menus, store expansions and digital initiatives is likely to have aided the company&rsquo;s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. However, commodity and labor inflation are likely to have hurt the bottom line in the fourth quarter.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXRH&rsquo;s fourth-quarter 2024 revenues and EPS is pegged at $1.42 billion and $1.66, indicating growth of 21.6% and 53.7%, respectively, from the year-ago figures.<br /><br />The company has an Earnings ESP of -0.86% and a Zacks Rank #2.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417805/what-s-in-store-for-these-three-restaurant-stocks-in-q4-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview_esp-2417805">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ HSBC to Sell Bahrain Retail Banking Operations Amid Restructuring ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:48:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HSBC Holdings PLC</strong> HSBC has agreed to sell its retail banking operations in Bahrain to the Bank of Bahrain and Kuwait (BBK) in light of the ongoing global restructuring plan. The deal excludes its corporate and private banking businesses in Bahrain.<br />&nbsp;<br />The deal will comprise a transfer of retail loans, deposits and accounts of nearly 76,000 customers to BBK. Financial details of the deal, which is anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025, were kept under wraps.<br /><br />This move aligns with HSBC&rsquo;s transformation plan to improve operating efficiency and a strategic shift toward the Asian region. In 2020, the company announced its transformation plan to reshape its underperforming businesses, simplify complex organizations and reduce costs.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Restructuring Efforts by HSBC</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">HSBC has been scaling back its operations in underperforming regions to reduce costs and accelerate its shift toward the Asian region.<br /><br />In sync with this, last week, a person with direct knowledge of the matter reported to Reuters that HSBC has axed nearly 40 investment bankers in Hong Kong.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Big Data refers to the vast and complex information generated daily from various sources, including social media, business transactions, sensors and online searches. This data can be structured (organized in databases), unstructured (such as emails, videos, and images), or semi-structured (a mix of both). Companies leverage Big Data to analyze trends, make predictions and enhance decision-making using advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To fully understand Big Data and its impact, it is essential to consider the six key factors that define it, known as the &quot;six V&rsquo;s.&quot; Volume refers to the massive amount of data produced daily, such as social media posts and online purchases. Velocity is the speed at which data is generated and processed, allowing businesses to respond in real-time, like Google search results appearing instantly. Variety highlights the different formats of data, from structured spreadsheets to unstructured videos and text. Value focuses on extracting meaningful insights to support better business decisions. Variability refers to how data patterns shift over time, such as changing social media trends. Finally, Veracity ensures data accuracy and reliability, preventing incorrect information from leading to poor decisions. These six V&rsquo;s help businesses process and analyze data efficiently, enabling smarter strategies and innovation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With these foundational elements in place, the Big Data industry is poised for remarkable growth. As technology evolves, the demand for robust data analytics solutions is surging across industries, from healthcare and finance to retail and manufacturing. According to MarketsandMarkets, the global Big Data market is expected to reach $401.2 billion by 2028.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This surge in demand has given tech companies a significant advantage as they develop the tools and infrastructure needed to harness Big Data&rsquo;s potential. For instance, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> NVDA powers Big Data with advanced chips, while <strong>Salesforce</strong> CRM transforms raw data into insights, helping businesses better understand and serve customers. Even <strong>Alphabet</strong> GOOGL and <strong>Apple</strong> AAPL rely on Big Data to enhance user experience and streamline business operations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#39;re looking to capitalize on this trend, our Big Data Screen makes it easy to identify high-potential stocks at any given time. Leveraging advanced tools, our thematic screens identify companies shaping the future, making it easier to capitalize on emerging trends.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Explore 30 cutting-edge investment themes with&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Zacks Thematic Screens</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;and discover your next big opportunity. </em></strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">4 Big Data Stocks to Buy Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NVIDIA</strong> has evolved significantly with the Big Data revolution, starting with the introduction of its CUDA programming model in 2006. CUDA unlocked the parallel processing power of GPUs for various data-intensive tasks, laying the foundation for NVIDIA&#39;s growth in Big Data. This breakthrough enabled researchers and companies to use NVIDIA&rsquo;s GPUs beyond gaming, especially in areas like AI model training and scientific computing???.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2012, NVIDIA GPUs powered the AlexNet neural network, which won the ImageNet competition, marking a pivotal moment in AI development. This event highlighted the capabilities of NVIDIA&#39;s hardware in processing massive datasets, helping Big Data applications in industries like healthcare, automotive and finance. Over the years, NVIDIA continued to enhance its data center offerings, introducing the Tensor Core GPU in 2017 and acquiring Mellanox in 2020 to improve high-performance networking capabilities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By 2023, NVIDIA had launched the DGX Cloud, an AI-training-as-a-service platform, further cementing its role in Big Data and AI infrastructure. Its GPUs became essential for training modern AI models, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to generative AI content creation. Looking ahead to 2025, NVIDIA, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), anticipates continued strong demand for its AI-optimized data center solutions, particularly with the introduction of its new Blackwell architecture. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Salesforce</strong> began leveraging Big Data in a transformative way around 2016 when businesses increasingly needed real-time customer insights. As data generation skyrocketed, traditional customer relationship management (CRM) solutions became inadequate, prompting Salesforce to expand its AI and analytics capabilities. The introduction of Einstein AI in 2016 marked a major milestone, enabling companies to analyze vast amounts of customer data for predictive insights. Over the years, Salesforce evolved from a cloud-based CRM platform into a comprehensive AI-driven enterprise solution, integrating Big Data across sales, marketing and customer service operations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By 2024, Salesforce had fully embraced AI-powered automation, leveraging its extensive data cloud to process trillions of Einstein transactions weekly. The company&#39;s latest innovation, Agentforce, represents a major step forward, allowing businesses to deploy AI agents that can autonomously handle customer interactions, sales processes and marketing campaigns. This shift toward digital labor has already gained traction, with major enterprises like FedEx and IBM integrating Agentforce into their operations. Additionally, Salesforce&#39;s investments in AI-driven analytics and workflow automation have significantly improved business efficiency, making it an essential platform for enterprises navigating the data-driven economy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Salesforce expects continued growth in AI-driven automation in 2025, with Agentforce playing a central role in reshaping customer interactions. The company anticipates that AI agents will handle a significant portion of service requests, reducing human workload while improving response times and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, Salesforce is preparing for the launch of Agentforce 2.0, which is expected to bring even greater accuracy and efficiency to AI-driven processes. As businesses increasingly adopt AI-driven solutions, the #2 Ranked company is positioning itself as the leader in enterprise AI, driving digital transformation across industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Palantir Technologies</strong> began leveraging the Big Data revolution as early as 2010 when its Gotham platform became a crucial tool for intelligence agencies dealing with large-scale, complex datasets. Over the years, the company expanded its capabilities beyond government contracts, introducing Foundry, a platform designed to help commercial enterprises integrate, analyze and derive insights from vast amounts of data. This shift allowed Palantir to capitalize on the growing demand for data-driven decision-making, particularly in industries like finance, healthcare and manufacturing, where real-time analytics became essential.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By the early 2020s, Palantir had fully embraced AI and machine learning as key components of its platforms. The integration of AI into its Foundry and Gotham platforms, along with the introduction of Apollo for continuous software deployment, positioned the company as a leader in operational intelligence. In 2023, Palantir launched the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which further enhanced its ability to process large datasets using advanced AI models. This evolution allowed organizations to automate workflows, predict outcomes and optimize complex operations, reinforcing Palantir&rsquo;s role in the AI-driven Big Data landscape.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By 2024, Palantir&#39;s growth had accelerated significantly due to the widespread adoption of AI in business and government. The company reported record revenues and customer expansions, with its AI-powered solutions driving efficiency gains across multiple sectors. Companies and government agencies sought Palantir&rsquo;s platforms to harness the power of AI for data processing, automation and strategic decision-making. The Zacks Rank #2 company&rsquo;s commitment to integrating AI with Big Data positioned it as a key player in the digital transformation era, solidifying its dominance in both commercial and government markets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Moody&rsquo;s</strong> has undergone a significant transformation with the rise of Big Data, integrating advanced analytics and AI to enhance its risk assessment capabilities. Over the last decade, the company has leveraged AI and machine learning to provide more precise insights into credit markets and financial risks. This shift has allowed Moody&rsquo;s to offer more comprehensive risk solutions, using vast datasets to assess interrelated risks such as supply chain disruptions, cyber threats and extreme weather events. The expansion of its data-driven approach has positioned the company as a leader in financial analytics, helping clients navigate complex economic landscapes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company began significantly benefiting from Big Data in 2014, marking the start of a deeper integration of data-driven technologies into its services. Since then, Moody&rsquo;s has continually modernized its infrastructure, including acquisitions that have strengthened its analytics capabilities, such as the purchase of RMS, which expanded its climate risk data. The introduction of cloud-based intelligent risk platforms has further enhanced the company&rsquo;s ability to process massive datasets efficiently, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making for clients in banking, insurance and capital markets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By 2024, Moody&rsquo;s had fully embraced AI, particularly Generative AI, to further enhance its analytics and research solutions. The company integrated AI-powered tools into its workflow, allowing for automation in risk assessments and financial modeling. This has led to substantial improvements in efficiency, enabling Moody&rsquo;s to process trillions of dollars in rated debt while maintaining high analytical accuracy. As the demand for sophisticated risk assessment continues to grow, the #2 Ranked company remains at the forefront of financial technology, continuously investing in data innovation to provide cutting-edge insights for its clients.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417795/4-top-big-data-stocks-to-add-to-your-portfolio-right-away?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|investment_ideas-2417795">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Why Coterra Energy Stock Is a Buy Ahead of Its Q4 Earnings ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:41:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Coterra Energy</strong> CTRA is slated to release fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 24, after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter&rsquo;s earnings per share (EPS) and revenues is pegged at 42 cents and $1.4 billion, respectively.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em><br /><br />The earnings estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have been revised downward by a penny over the past 30 days. The bottom-line projection indicates a decline of 19.2% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues, meanwhile, suggests a year-over-year decrease of 12.3%.<br /><br />For full-year 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CTRA&rsquo;s revenues is pegged at $5.5 billion, implying a drop of 7.4% year over year. The consensus mark for 2024 EPS is pegged at $1.60, indicating a contraction of around 29.2%.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/31/94430.jpg?v=35164216" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the trailing four quarters, the Houston, TX-based gas exporter surpassed EPS estimates once and missed in the other three, as reflected in the chart below.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Coterra Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Coterra Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/28/1739966451.png" title="" width="541" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Coterra Energy Inc. price-eps-surprise | Coterra Energy Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Coterra Energy Profile</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Coterra Energy is an independent upstream operator engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Headquartered in Houston, TX, the firm is focused on the Permian Basin, Marcellus Shale and Anadarko Basin. The company got its current form following the October 2021 merger between Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Corporation and Cimarex Energy Co.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Whispers</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Coterra Energy this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.<br /><br />You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />CTRA has an Earnings ESP of +0.89% and a Zacks Rank #2. <strong>You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s Shaping Q4 Results?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Coterra&#39;s $3.95 billion acquisition of Franklin Mountain Energy and Avant Natural Resources strengthens its position in New Mexico&rsquo;s lucrative Permian Basin. This consolidation allows for longer, more efficient wells and reduces location costs, increasing overall profitability. With a higher percentage of oil in production, the newly acquired acreage diversifies revenue streams, enabling the company to perform under varying commodity price scenarios. Importantly, this allows CTRA to compensate for the weakness in natural gas prices that has affected its revenue stream.<br /><br />Coterra&rsquo;s strategic shift toward its oil-rich assets in the Delaware Basin, while reducing capex on natural gas, is expected to have positioned it to capitalize on robust oil prices. In the third quarter, the company&rsquo;s oil volumes surpassed the guidance. We expect this uptick to have continued in the third quarter.<br /><br />Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s fourth-quarter crude volume is pegged at 110 thousand barrels (MBbl) per day, down from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level of 105 MBbl per day. In the Permian, improved drilling efficiencies have driven well costs down significantly. This focus on capital efficiency positions Coterra for consistent oil growth and robust returns.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Price Performance &amp; Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The market appears to have taken a strong liking to the company over the past six months. During this time, the energy explorer&#39;s stock has risen 16%, outpacing the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 10% gain. Coterra has also outperformed the broader Oil/Energy sector, its subindustry, and competitors like <strong>Ovintiv</strong> OVV. This momentum reflects growing investor confidence, fueled by the company&rsquo;s strategic expansion efforts, strong operational execution, and well-planned acquisitions.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">CTRA, OVV 6 Month Stock Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/e7/94432.jpg?v=1501045490" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">CTRA looks appealing from a valuation standpoint, confirmed by a Zacks Value Score of B. When comparing its EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) &mdash; a common measure of a company&rsquo;s worth &mdash; it stands out as competitive against its peers. Even if we look at the price/earnings ratio, Coterra&rsquo;s shares currently trade at around 9X forward earnings multiple. This is in line with the subsector.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/89/94436.jpg?v=2053316297" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Assessing Coterra Energy&rsquo;s Prospects: Buy the Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Coterra Energy is positioning itself for long-term growth with strategic acquisitions and operational efficiency. The company&rsquo;s asset purchase in late 2024 is set to boost production significantly through 2025, strengthening its foothold in the Permian Basin. Financially, Coterra remains robust, generating in excess of $ billion in free cash flow in the most recent quarter, with a low debt-to-capitalization of 13.7%, ensuring stability. Additionally, Coterra Energy secured NGL export contracts to Europe and Asia from 2027 to 2038, providing revenue diversification and insulation from domestic market fluctuations. The company&rsquo;s cost-cutting initiatives, including a 12% reduction in drilling expenses, further enhance profitability.<br /><br />Investors have taken notice &mdash; CTRA has outperformed the broader energy sector, gaining 16% in six months. With strong financials, expanding production, and strategic international deals, Coterra remains well-positioned for future growth. In other words, the stock presents a compelling investment opportunity.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417790/why-coterra-energy-stock-is-a-buy-ahead-of-its-q4-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2417790">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Huntsman's Q4 Earnings Miss, Revenues Surpass Estimates ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:28:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Huntsman Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s HUN fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted loss per share was 25 cents, compared with a loss of 21 cents in the year-ago quarter. It was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss per share of 12 cents.</p><p><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p>Revenues were $1,452 million, up around 3.5% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,447 million.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Huntsman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Huntsman Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/3a/1739966601.png" title="" width="568" /> <p>Huntsman Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Huntsman Corporation Quote</p></div><h2>HUN&rsquo;s Segment Highlights</h2><p><strong>Polyurethanes:</strong> Revenues from the segment rose 8% year over year to $970 million. The figure beat our estimate of $886.1 million. The revenue increase was primarily due to increased sales volumes. Sales volumes increased predominantly owing to increased demand and market share gains in specific markets. Segment-adjusted EBITDA rose on higher volumes, better margins, and lower fixed and variable costs, which were partly offset by reduced equity earnings from its minority-owned joint venture in China.</p><p><strong>Performance Products:</strong> Revenues moved down 8% to $239 million, which was below our estimate of $253.2 million. The decrease was primarily caused by lower sales volumes, which were partly offset by higher average selling prices. Sales volumes fell primarily owing to extended Maleic Anhydride outages during the quarter and slow construction activity. The drop in segment-adjusted EBITDA was mainly caused by lower sales volume, which was slightly offset by an improved mix and lower fixed costs.</p><p><strong>Advanced Materials:</strong> Revenues from the unit increased 1% to $254 million but fell short of our estimate of $264.2 million. Sales rose mostly due to higher sales volumes, which were slightly masked by lower average selling prices which fell essentially due to an unfavorable sales mix. Sales volumes rose in the infrastructure and general industry segments. The segment-adjusted EBITDA was flat due to higher sales volumes offset by higher fixed costs.</p><h2>HUN&rsquo;s Financials</h2><p>Free cash flow from continuing operations was $108 million compared with $83 million in the prior-year quarter. The company had approximately $1.7 billion combined cash and unused borrowing capacity as of Dec. 31, 2024.</p><p>The company spent $51 million on capital expenditures from continuing operations compared with $83 million in the prior-year quarter.</p><p>Net cash generated by operating activities from continuing operations was $159 million in the quarter.</p><h2>HUN&rsquo;s 2025 Outlook</h2><p>In 2025, Huntsman expects capital expenditures to be between $180 million and $190 million. The adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 35%.</p><h2>HUN&rsquo;s Stock Price Performance</h2><p>Shares of Huntsman have lost 26.9% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s 1.2% decline.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ee/94419.jpg?v=1128249209" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>HUN&#39;s Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h2><p>HUN currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).</p><p>Some better-ranked stocks in the Basic Materials space are <strong>Gold Fields Limited</strong> GFI, <strong>ICL Group Ltd.</strong> ICL and <strong>Fortuna Mining Corp.</strong> FSM. While GFI sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, ICL and FSM carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see<strong> the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><p>GFI is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 27. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gold Fields&rsquo; fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 46 cents per share. Its shares have gained 40.1% in the past year.</p><p>ICL is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ICL Group&rsquo;s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 6 cents per share. ICL beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 18.1%. Its shares have soared 23.6% in the past year.</p><p>FSM is slated to report fourth-quarter results on March 5. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fortuna&rsquo;s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 16 cents per share. FSM surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing it in the rest, with an average surprise of 53.6%.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Toll Brothers, Inc.</strong> TOL reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 (ended Jan. 31) results, with earnings and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and decreasing on a year-over-year basis, respectively. Shares of this leading luxury homebuilder plunged 5.6% in the after-hour trading session yesterday following the earnings release.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em><br /><br />The company&rsquo;s net income and earnings per share (EPS) fell short due to impairments and a delayed joint venture property sale. Toll Brothers highlighted that while demand remained solid, the spring selling season has been mixed, with affordability constraints and growing inventories pressuring sales, especially at the lower end. Toll Brothers is adjusting pricing, incentives, and spec starts at the community level to maintain balance.<br /><br />Looking ahead, Toll Brothers remains optimistic about the long-term housing market, citing favorable demographics, a housing shortage, and rising home values. With a luxury niche and well-located communities, the company believes it is positioned for continued success.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Toll Brothers Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Toll Brothers Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/a8/1739966082.png" title="" width="579" /> <p>Toll Brothers Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Toll Brothers Inc. Quote</p></div><h2>TOL&rsquo;s Quarterly Earnings &amp; Revenue Discussion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reported adjusted EPS of $1.75, which fell short of the consensus estimate of $1.99 by 12.1% and declined 22.2% from the year-ago period.<br /><br />Total revenues (including Home sales and Land sales and others) of $1.86 billion lagged the consensus mark of $1.9 billion by 2.1% and decreased 4.6% year over year. Growth was attributable to higher deliveries.</p><h2>Inside Toll Brothers&rsquo; Q1 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s total home sales revenues dipped 5% (below our projection of a 2% year-over-year decline) from the prior-year quarter to $1.84 billion. Homes delivered were up 3% (below our expectation of 4.6% growth year over year) from the year-ago quarter to 1,991 units. The average price of homes delivered was $924,700 for the quarter, down 7.8% from the year-ago level of $1,002,600. We had expected ASP to be down 6.3% year over year to $939,243.<br /><br />Net-signed contracts for the quarter were 2,307 units, up 13% year over year. The value of net signed contracts was $2.31 billion, reflecting a rise of 12% year over year. We had projected net-signed contracts to be up 19.9% in units and 19.4% in value for the quarter.<br /><br />At the fiscal first-quarter end, Toll Brothers had a backlog of 6,312 homes, representing a year-over-year decrease of 6%. Potential revenues from backlog declined 2% year over year to $6.94 billion. The average price of homes in the backlog was $1,099,200, up from $1,058,000 a year ago.<br /><br />The cancelation rate (as a percentage of signed contracts) for the reported quarter was 5.8% compared with 8.6% in the prior-year period.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s adjusted home sales gross margin was 26.9%, which contracted 200 basis points (bps) for the quarter. SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of home sales revenues, were 13.1%, which increased 120 bps from the year-ago quarter.</p><h2>Toll Brothers&rsquo; Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">TOL had cash and cash equivalents of $574.8 million at the fiscal first-quarter end compared with $1.3 billion at the fiscal 2024-end. The debt-to-capital ratio improved to 26% from 27% at the end of fiscal 2024. The net debt-to-capital ratio was 21.1% compared with 15.2% at the fiscal 2024-end. At the close of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company had $1.77 billion available on its $1.96 billion revolving credit facility, set to mature in February 2030.<br /><br />During the fiscal first quarter, the company bought back approximately 0.2 million shares at an average price of $127.02 per share, totaling $23.7 million.<br /><br />It controls 77,700 lots, 56% of which are under control rather than owned outright, ensuring sufficient land for future expansion. In February, it strengthened its balance sheet by extending loan maturities to 2030 and increasing credit facility capacity by $400 million.</p><h2>TOL&rsquo;s Fiscal Q2 Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Toll Brothers expects home deliveries of 2,500-2,700 units (compared with 2,641 units delivered in the prior-year quarter) at an average price of $940,000-$960,000 (suggesting a decline from $1,002,600 a year ago).<br /><br />Adjusted home sales gross margin is expected to be 27.25%, implying a decline from 28.2% in the year-ago period. SG&amp;A expenses are estimated to be 10.3% of home sales revenues, indicating a rise from 9% in the year-ago period. The company expects the effective tax rate to be 26%.</p><h2>What TOL Expects for Fiscal 2025</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For fiscal 2025, home deliveries are anticipated to be in the range of 11,200-11,600 units. The estimated range reflects growth from the fiscal 2024 level of 10,813. It expects the period-end community count to be 440-450.<br /><br />The average price of delivered homes is now expected to be $945,000-$965,000, indicating a decline from $976,900 in fiscal 2024.<br /><br />Toll Brothers expects an adjusted home sales gross margin of 27.25%. This reflects a decline from 28.4% reported in fiscal 2024.<br /><br />SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of home sales revenues, are now projected to be 9.4%-9.5%, still an increase from 9.3% reported in fiscal 2024. The company expects the effective tax rate to be 25.5%.</p><h2>TOL&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Peer Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Toll Brothers currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).<br /><br />You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.<br /><br /><strong>NVR, Inc. </strong>NVR reported impressive fourth-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and Homebuilding revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both metrics increased on a year-over-year basis. The quarterly performance showed strong growth in settlements. Although new orders decreased in the quarter, the average selling price increased.<br /><br />NVR&rsquo;s new orders decreased 8% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s level to 4,794 units. However, the ASP of new orders increased 4% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s figure to $469,000. On a unit basis, backlog at the end of Dec. 31, 2024, decreased 3% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s figure to 9,953 homes but rose 1% on a dollar basis to $4.79 billion.<br /><br /><strong>D.R. Horton, Inc.</strong> DHI reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 (ended Dec. 31, 2024) results, with earnings and revenues beating Zacks Consensus Estimate but decreasing on a year-over-year basis. Despite rising home inventories, the supply of affordable homes remains constrained, while favorable demographics continue to drive housing demand.<br /><br />To address affordability challenges and stimulate sales, the company leveraged incentives such as mortgage rate buydowns. Additionally, D.R. Horton focused on offering smaller, affordable floor plans to align with the needs of cost-conscious homebuyers. DHI expects consolidated 2024 revenues to be in the range of $36-$37.5 billion compared with $36.8 billion in fiscal 2023. Homes closed are anticipated to be within 90,000-92,000 units.<br /><br /><strong>KB Home</strong> KBH reported impressive fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein both revenues and earnings surpassed expectations. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics increased, highlighting its resilience in a fluctuating housing market.<br /><br />KBH&rsquo;s results underscore the effectiveness of its strategy, which is driven by faster build times and a strong appetite for homeownership despite mortgage rate pressures. However, challenges such as mortgage rate headwinds and potential regulatory shifts could temper the pace of growth. While challenges remain, its strong order book and expanded community count suggest a solid growth trajectory for 2025.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417771/toll-brothers-stock-down-on-q1-earnings-revenues-miss?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2417771">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 19, 2025 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Roku ROKU as the Bull of the Day and Constellation Brands STZ as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), The Progressive Corp. PGR and The Allstate Corp. ALL<strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Bull of the Day:</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">I could get used to a market like this. All-time highs nearly every day? Yes, please! But, we can&rsquo;t rest on our laurels around here. The market has a funny way of surprising us the most when everyone is starting to get a little too greedy and a little too complacent.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">That doesn&rsquo;t mean that we can&rsquo;t celebrate the big winners we see them. There are a ton of stocks out there that are rallying for good reasons, and are seeing their earnings move instep with those stock prices. The Zacks Rank helps us uncover those stocks with the strongest earnings trends. Trends like we see in today&rsquo;s Bull of the Day.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today&rsquo;s Bull of the Day is Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) <strong>Roku</strong>. Roku is a leading company in the streaming media industry, primarily known for its digital media players and smart TV operating system. The company&rsquo;s business is centered around three key areas, Streaming devices and Smart TVs, advertising and content distribution, as well as platform services and subscriptions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is that Roku&rsquo;s last earnings report prompted several analysts around Wall Street to increase their earnings estimates for the current year and next year. On February 13<sup>th</sup>, the company reported a beat on both top and bottom lines, while guiding initial FY25 revenues of $4.61 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As a result, analysts bumped up their expectations for both the current year and next year. Our current year Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for a loss of 80 cents, up from a loss of 93 cents sixty days ago. Next year&rsquo;s number has pushed up to a profit of a dime versus expectations for a nickel loss.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A quick look at the Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart shows the consistency recently in Roku&rsquo;s earnings. Five consecutive quarterly earnings beats for the company now. Estimates continue to start lower and spend the year ticking higher. That&rsquo;s exactly what you want to see from a long-term winner. Roku is still well off its all-time highs which sit over $450. The stock is currently trading below $100.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Bear of the Day:</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Markets are rocking and rolling, up at all-time highs with no signs of stopping. Of course, we all know that it can&rsquo;t last forever. And when it comes time to pay the piper, the brutality will be swift. During that time, it&rsquo;s best to find stocks with strong earnings trends which have retreated in price. You won&rsquo;t want to be left holding the bag in a stock that&rsquo;s down in price, and has seen its earnings move in the wrong direction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today&rsquo;s Bear of the Day is a stock that has seen its earnings estimates move in the wrong direction. I&rsquo;m talking about Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) <strong>Constellation Brands. </strong>Constellation Brands is a leading producer and marketer of alcoholic beverages, specializing in beer, wine, and spirits. The company owns popular beer brands like Corona, Modelo, and Pacifico in the U.S., along with a premium wine and spirits portfolio that includes Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, and Svedka Vodka. Constellation focuses on brand innovation, strategic acquisitions, and premiumization to drive growth in the beverage alcohol industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Constellation Brands is not in the good graces of our Zacks Rank. The reason is that nine analysts have cut their earnings expectations for the current year over the last sixty days, while eight have done so for next year. The bearish moves have dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $13.72 to $13.50 while next year&rsquo;s number is off from $15.02 to $14.44.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From a valuation perspective, the good news for investors is that Constellation is trading at 12x earnings. That&rsquo;s cheaper than the industry average of 12.8x. If the company can right the ship and hold earnings steady, there&rsquo;s a real chance at recovery.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Constellation is in the Beverages &ndash; Alcohol industry which ranks in the Bottom 10% of our Zacks Industry Rank.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Additional content:</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Berkshire Hathaway Pre-Q4 Earnings Analysis: Time to Sell the Stock?</em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Berkshire Hathaway </strong>is expected to witness a decline in its top line when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 results. However, the bottom line is expected to improve.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BRK.B&rsquo;s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $88.3 billion, indicating 5.4% decline from the year-ago reported figure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $4.43 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BRK.B&rsquo;s fourth-quarter earnings witnessed no movement in the past 30 days. The estimate suggests a year-over-year increase of 13%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BRK.B&rsquo;s Decent Earnings Surprise History</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Berkshire Hathway&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 45.28%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">What the Zacks Model Unveils for Berkshire Hathaway Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Berkshire this time around. This is because a stock needs to have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case, as you can see below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Earnings ESP</strong>: BRK.B has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $4.43.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Berkshire Hathaway Inc. price-eps-surprise | Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Quote</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Zacks Rank</strong>: BRK.B currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Likely to Shape BRK.B&rsquo;s Q4 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Better pricing, solid retention, higher average premiums per auto policy, increased exposure and favorable reserve development are likely to have benefited its insurance business. Continued insurance business growth is expected to have increased float.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, high catastrophe losses are likely to have been a drag on underwriting profitability. The fourth quarter faced the wrath of Hurricane Milton. CoreLogic estimated losses from Hurricane Milton to be about $34 billion, with insured losses between $17 billion to $28 billion. Thus, the combined ratio is likely to have deteriorated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GEICO, its private passenger automobile insurance business, is expected to have delivered an improved performance, banking on higher average premiums per auto policy as well as lower claims frequencies, coupled with improved operating efficiencies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investment results are likely to benefit from higher yields and a larger investment asset base.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Unfavorable changes in business mix and lower fuel surcharge revenues are likely to have weighed on the railroad business. However, car/unit volumes are likely to have increased.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Earnings of BNSF are likely to reflect higher unit volume, improvements in employee productivity and lower other operating costs. However, higher litigation charges are likely to have been a partial offset.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Improved earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities, natural gas pipeline and other energy businesses are likely to have benefited the utilities and energy business. However, lower earnings from the real estate brokerage business are expected to have dampened the upside.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Manufacturing, service and retailing businesses are likely to have benefited from higher customer demand for products and services in many businesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Share buybacks are likely to have provided an additional boost to the bottom line.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BRK.B&rsquo;s Price Performance &amp; Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock outperformed the industry, sector and S&amp;P 500 in 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock is trading at a price-to-book value of 1.64X, slightly higher than the industry&rsquo;s 1.63X. It is attractively valued compared with other insurers like <strong>The Progressive Corp. </strong>and <strong>The Allstate Corp.</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Investment Thesis</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Among its diverse business activities, the most important is its insurance operations. The insurance business is exposed to the vagaries of nature, which induces volatility in the company&rsquo;s underwriting profitability and weighs on its combined ratio. An extremely active 2024 hurricane season with 25 named storms, including 12 hurricanes and six major hurricanes as predicted by the Colorado State University, are likely to have diluted the bottom line of this insurer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, this company creates tremendous value for shareholders, given its dominant market presence, diverse business activities and, above all, the name Warren Buffett.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What Should Investors Do Now With BRK.B Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A better-than-expected private passenger automobile insurance business will limit the downside arising from catastrophe losses. Also, better performance from other businesses should offer respite.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, an unfavorable return on capital, a likely decline in the fourth-quarter top line, lowered times interest earned, and contracting margins make the stock vulnerable. The company&rsquo;s exposure to catastrophes tends to make its underwriting results volatile. Notably, insurance operations contribute around one-fourth of Berkshire&rsquo;s top line. Also, given its premium valuation, investors should stay away from the stock for now.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+48.4%, +50.2%</strong> and <strong>+56.7%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Media Contact</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lucid Group</strong>&nbsp;LCID is slated to release&nbsp;fourth-quarter 2024 results&nbsp;on Feb. 25, after market close. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at a loss of 26 cents a share on revenues of $225.5 million.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The loss per share estimate for the fourth quarter of 2024 has remained unchanged over the past 90 days. The bottom-line projection indicates a year-over-year improvement of 10.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests year-over-year growth of 43.5%.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/42/94413.jpg?v=104533304" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for LCID&rsquo;s revenues is pegged at $1.34 billion, implying a rise of 67.4% year over year. The consensus mark for the 2025 bottom line is pegged at a loss of 90 cents per share, indicating an improvement from a loss of $1.25 per share projected for 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the trailing four quarters, this California-based electric vehicle (EV) startup missed EPS estimates on all occasions, with the average negative earnings surprise being 14.8%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Lucid Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Lucid Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/1e/1739960868.png" style="width: 600px; height: 296px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Lucid Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Lucid Group, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2>Q4 Earnings Whispers for LCID</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Lucid this earnings season. The combination of a positive&nbsp;Earnings ESP&nbsp;and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That&rsquo;s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our&nbsp;Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">LCID has an Earnings ESP of +3.85% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Factors Shaping Lucid&rsquo;s Q4 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Lucid sold 3,099 vehicles in the December quarter, a record for the company. Deliveries rose 79% on a yearly basis and 11.4% on a sequential basis. A boost in deliveries is likely to drive revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Production in the fourth quarter of 2024 came in at 3,386 units, up from 1,805 units in the third quarter of 2024 and 2,391 units in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the flip side, Lucid is spending heavily on research and development expenses. R&amp;D expenses flared up 40.5% in the third quarter of 2024. In the first nine months of 2024, R&amp;D expenses totaled $896 million, up from $694 million in the corresponding period of 2023. Selling, general and operating expenses have also been rising. Lucid&rsquo;s operating expenses significantly exceed its revenues and the trend is expected to have continued, limiting the company&rsquo;s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter as well.</p><h2>LCID Stock Price Performance &amp; Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past six months, shares of Lucid have risen more than 7%, underperforming the industry, sector and the S&amp;P 500 index. Its close competitor <strong>Rivian</strong> RIVN has seen its stock price rise roughly 9% in the same timeframe.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">6-Month Price Performance</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/26/94412.jpg?v=107567993" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">LCID is currently trading at a forward sales multiple of 6.5X. In comparison, Rivian is trading at a forward sales multiple of 2.65X.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a2/94414.jpg?v=1210687919" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>How Should You Play Lucid Before Q4 Results?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Lucid made progress in 2024, achieving its production targets and delivering a record number of vehicles. The company is expanding its lineup beyond the Lucid Air with the Gravity SUV. Gravity Grand Touring, priced at C$134,500, is available for order, while Gravity Touring, starting at C$113,500, is expected in late 2025. These new models could help drive future growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lucid benefits from strong financial backing from the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia, which has invested $8.9 billion since 2018. Subsequent to the third quarter of 2024, LCID raised $1.75 billion in capital, which further bolsters its cash reserves, extending its financial runway into 2026. However, these capital raises have resulted in significant shareholder dilution, which remains a key risk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company also faces major challenges in scaling production while maintaining its luxury EV positioning. The high-end EV market is highly competitive, with both established automakers and new entrants increasing pressure. Additionally, Lucid&rsquo;s cash burn remains high. Its reliance on equity raises a red flag.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Political and macroeconomic uncertainties also add to the concerns. A potential shift in U.S. EV policies under the Trump administration could impact demand. Moreover, looming tariffs could disrupt supply chains and increase costs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While Lucid has taken steps to control costs, substantial external funding is still required. Investors should watch for improvements in production efficiency, deliveries and financial performance before investing in the stock. Until there is clear progress, investment in LCID stock should be avoided.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417772/lucid-stock-ahead-of-q4-earnings-to-buy-or-not-to-buy?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2417772">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks Worthy of Value Investors' Attention ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Value investors actively look for stocks that they think the market has undervalued. It is their belief that the market overreacts to good and bad news, which results in stock price movements that do not correspond with a company&#39;s long-term fundamentals. This, according to them, creates an opportunity to profit when the price of the stock goes down. Value investors turn to&nbsp;financial ratios&nbsp;to&nbsp;help analyze a company&#39;s fundamentals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The price-to-book (P/B) ratio is widely favored by value investors for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. The ratio is used to compare a stock&rsquo;s market value/price to its book value.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The P/B ratio is calculated as below:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per share</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The P/B ratio helps identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. <strong>General Motors Company </strong>GM, <strong>KT Corporation </strong>KT, <strong>The Greenbrier Companies </strong>GBX, <strong>USANA Health Sciences</strong> USNA and <strong>Enersys </strong>ENS are some such stocks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now, let us understand the concept of book value.</p><h2>What is Book Value?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">There are several ways by which book value can be defined.&nbsp;Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company&rsquo;s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders&rsquo; equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company&rsquo;s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.</p><h2>Understanding P/B Ratio</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock&rsquo;s price may be significantly high &mdash; thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one &mdash; in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.</p><h2>Screening Parameters</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median:</strong> A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median:</strong> The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company&rsquo;s sales/revenues &mdash; a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: </strong>The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share &mdash; a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PEG less than 1:</strong> PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued, and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Current Price greater than or equal to $5: </strong>They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000:</strong> A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2:</strong> Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.</p><h2>5 Low Price-to-Book Stocks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Headquartered in Detroit,&nbsp;<strong>General Motors</strong> is one of the world&rsquo;s largest automakers.

<![CDATA[ Buy 4 Low-Beta Stocks BJ, VIRT, TXO & FCCO to Beat Market Volatility ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:20:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The U.S. stock market is expected to remain volatile due to several factors. While indexes like the S&amp;P 500 have hit record highs, market movements have been choppy due to concerns over global trade policies, inflation trends and the Federal Reserve&#39;s actions on interest rates. Tariff uncertainties and shifting economic policies add to unpredictability, while sector-specific pullbacks, like in consumer discretionary and communication services, create further fluctuations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Against this backdrop, creating a curated portfolio of low-beta stocks is a wise move. This offers a safeguard against heightened market fluctuations and positions investors to navigate volatility with greater resilience and foresight.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, stocks like <strong>BJ&rsquo;s Wholesale Club </strong>BJ, <strong>Virtu Financial Inc</strong> VIRT, <strong>TXO Partners LP</strong> TXO and <strong>First Community Corporation</strong> FCCO are worth betting on.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What Does Beta of a Stock Measure?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Beta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset compared to the market. In other words, beta measures the extent of a security&rsquo;s price movement relative to the market. In this article, we are considering the S&amp;P 500 as the market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If a stock has a beta of 1, then the price of the stock will move with the market. So, the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1. In the same way, the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For example, if the market offers a return of 20%, a stock with a beta of 3 will return 60%, which is overwhelming. Similarly, when the market slips 20%, the stock will sink 60%, which is devastating.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Screening Criteria Using Research Wizard:</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">We have taken&nbsp;a <strong>beta between 0 and 0.6</strong>&nbsp;as our prime criterion for screening stocks that are less volatile than the market. However, this should not be the only factor to be considered while selecting a winning strategy. We need to take into account other parameters that can add value to the portfolio.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks Greater Than Zero:</strong>&nbsp;This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last month.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Average 20-Day Volume Greater Than 50,000:</strong>&nbsp;A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Price Greater Than or Equal to $5:</strong>&nbsp;They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Zacks Rank Equal to 1:</strong>&nbsp;Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are four of the 11 stocks that qualified for the screening:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BJ&rsquo;s Wholesale Club </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">BJ&rsquo;s Wholesale Club presents a compelling investment opportunity as a leading membership-based warehouse retailer with a strong value proposition. The company continues to expand its footprint, as seen in its latest club opening in Brooksville, FL, reinforcing its commitment to providing unbeatable savings&mdash;up to 25% off grocery store prices&mdash;to budget-conscious consumers. BJ&rsquo;s diversified product offerings, including fresh foods, household essentials and gas, enhance its competitive positioning, while digital innovations like ExpressPay and same-day delivery cater to evolving consumer preferences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Virtu Financial</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Virtu Financial is making great progress with its Virtu Technology Solutions, which is becoming more popular. This service helps other companies, like broker-dealers, use advanced tools for trading and analyzing financial data. By offering these high-tech solutions, Virtu is setting itself up for long-term growth and success in the market. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TXO Partners</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">TXO Partners has a strong footprint in the oil-rich Permian &ndash; the most prolific basin in the United States. Being involved in exploration and production activities, the master limited partnership may continue to gain from a favorable commodity pricing environment. Notably, TXO&#39;s Mancos Shale project, with 58,500 contiguous acres holding nearly 3 Tcfe of natural gas potential, is set to be a game-changer by potentially increasing reserves fivefold, with Phase I targeting a 3,520-acre block estimated to hold 200-300 Bcf of natural gas, nearly doubling existing reserves.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>First Community </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">First Community presents a strong investment case as a well-managed community bank with consistent earnings, solid loan and deposit growth, and disciplined capital management. The company maintains excellent asset quality, a diversified revenue stream from banking and investment advisory services and a longstanding dividend history. Its focus on core deposits and prudent risk management positions it for sustainable long-term growth???.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

<![CDATA[ Live Nation Gears Up for Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:19:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.</strong> LYV is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 20, after market close. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 5.1%.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><h2>Q4 Estimates of LYV</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter loss has widened to $1.19 per share from $1.18 in the past 30 days. In the prior-year quarter, the company reported an adjusted loss per share of $1.22. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $5.54 billion, indicating a 5.1% year-over-year decline.</p><h2>Factors to Note Ahead of LYV&rsquo;s Q4 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Live Nation is anticipated to have experienced a year-over-year decrease in fourth-quarter revenues, owing to dismal Concerts revenues. However, strong ticket sales, robust sponsorship growth and a rise in average per-fan spending are likely to have positively aided the company&rsquo;s results. The company continues to expand the industry&rsquo;s infrastructure with music-focused venues to support artists and meet untapped fan demand globally.<br /><br />For fourth-quarter 2024, our model predicts Concerts revenues to have decreased 8.3% year over year to $4.47 billion. However, we expect Sponsorship and Advertising as well as Ticketing revenues to have increased 9.4% and 3%, respectively, year over year to $279.5 million and $762.1 million.<br /><br />However, increased labor-hiring costs, artist activation costs and other operational expenses are likely to have hurt LYV&rsquo;s bottom line in the quarter to be reported. The company is cautious of cost overruns related to the development and expansion of live music venues.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3><h2> <img alt="Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.

This is exactly the case here.<br /><br />You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br /><strong>LYV&rsquo;s Earnings ESP:</strong> LYV has an Earnings ESP of +24.44% at present.<br /><br /><strong>LYV&rsquo;s Zacks Rank:</strong> LYV currently holds a Zacks Rank #2.</p><h2>Other Stocks With the Favorable Combination</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some other stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary space that investors may consider, as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around.<br /><br /><strong>Life Time Group Holdings, Inc.</strong> LTH has an Earnings ESP of +14.29% and a Zacks Rank of 1 at present.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>General Mills, Inc. </strong>GIS has been making strong strides in its Accelerate strategy, introduced five years ago, which has enabled the company to focus on long-term, sustainable growth. The strategy has been centered around strengthening its brand portfolio, increasing innovation, building digital infrastructure and enhancing its commitment to people and the planet. These efforts have paid off in the form of financial results that meet or exceed long-term goals, reinforcing the company&rsquo;s confidence in its future growth potential.<br /><br />The core idea behind General Mills&rsquo; Accelerate strategy is to deliver sustainable growth by optimizing key aspects of its operations and responding to evolving consumer demands. At the Consumer Analyst Group of New York 2025 Conference, the company highlighted its progress and outlined the steps it is taking to further strengthen its position in the market. Through investments in both brand development and digital transformation, General Mills is aiming to achieve top-tier returns for its shareholders while remaining adaptable to changing market dynamics.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/58/94426.jpg?v=1396356110" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">GIS&#39; Strategic Focus on Brand Building and Innovation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A key pillar of the Accelerate strategy is the focus on building brands. General Mills has continuously invested in its portfolio, which includes nine brands that generate over $1 billion in retail sales each. This substantial media investment &mdash; up nearly 40 percent since fiscal 2019 &mdash; is a testament to the company&#39;s commitment to brand building. Moving into fiscal 2025, General Mills is set to increase these media investments further, reinforcing its brand presence.<br /><br />Innovation plays a crucial role in General Mills&rsquo; drive for growth. The company has made consistent strides in innovating products to cater to shifting consumer preferences. Over the past years, innovation has become a larger portion of General Mills&#39; strategy, with a promising pipeline for future product launches. These innovations have the potential to drive significant growth, with new launches expected to contribute to fiscal 2026&#39;s performance.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">GIS Harnessing Digital Infrastructure for Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In an increasingly digital world, General Mills has focused on leveraging technology to enhance its operational efficiency. The company has invested heavily in building a robust digital infrastructure, doubling its investment in digital, data and technology since 2019. This has empowered the company to make data-driven decisions, improve supply chain operations and enhance marketing strategies. The digital transformation has created opportunities for scaling General Mills&#39; business.<br /><br />Beyond financial success, General Mills remains dedicated to its broader social and environmental impact. As part of its Accelerate strategy, the company is committed to advancing its Global Impact initiatives.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Sustained Returns for GIS&#39; Shareholders</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">General Mills has delivered consistent financial returns to its shareholders. Since fiscal 2019, the company has returned over $11 billion through dividends and share repurchases, driven by steady sales growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow management. These efforts ensure that General Mills not only remains a leader in its industry but continues to generate significant value for its investors over the long term.<br /><br />With its well-rounded approach to growth &mdash; emphasizing brand strength, innovation, digital transformation and social responsibility &mdash; General Mills is positioning itself for a future of sustainable success and robust shareholder returns.<br /><br />Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have dropped 12.5% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s decline of 11.9%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>United Natural Foods, Inc.</strong> UNFI distributes natural, organic, specialty, produce and conventional grocery and non-food products in the United States and Canada.

<![CDATA[ 4 Stocks to Buy as Restaurant Sales Soar Amid Price Challenges ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:09:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Consumers are feeling the heat of price pressures once again. Inflation has been climbing, raising concerns about the economy&rsquo;s health. Due to this, the retail sector took a hit in January, with sales declining sharply. However, spending at food services and drinking places was not hampered as an increasing number of Americans continued to eat out in January.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurant sales grew at a solid pace in January despite overall retail sales taking a hit. Given the positive sentiment, it would be ideal to invest in restaurant stocks such as <strong>Brinker International, Inc.</strong> EAT, <strong>Kura Sushi USA, Inc.</strong> KRUS, <strong>Darden Restaurants, Inc.</strong> DRI and <strong>Potbelly Corporation</strong> PBPB.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).&nbsp;You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Restaurant Sales Continue to Grow</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Commerce Department said in its retail sales report that sales at restaurants totaled $90.8 billion in January, jumping 0.9% month over month after increasing 0.1% in the prior month. Year over year, retail sales increased 6.9% in January.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Economists consider eating at restaurants a significant measure of a household&#39;s financial situation. This means that despite price pressures, consumers have solid cash in hand, which has allowed them to spend lavishly at restaurants.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the report showed that retail sales fell 0.9% in January, its first decline since August and the sharpest drop in nearly two years. However, many experts see the unexpected drop in retail sales as a result of extreme winter temperatures and wildfires.</p><h2>Restaurant Sales Poised to Grow</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Although inflation has been on the rise over the past few months, consumers have been spending lavishly. The consumer price index (CPI) increased by 0.5% in January, following a 0.4% rise in December. This marks the sharpest increase since August 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rising prices have posed challenges for restaurant owners, as cost-conscious customers focus on getting the best value. Quick-service restaurants, particularly those emphasizing affordability, have remained resilient in this challenging market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With budget-conscious diners looking for low-cost meal options, competition in the value-driven sector has intensified. To draw in and keep customers, brands are enhancing promotions and introducing cost-saving deals. Industry players are seeing consistent demand for budget-friendly options and competitive pricing strategies. Many restaurants are strengthening their marketing efforts, forming strategic alliances, and introducing new products to sustain customer engagement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to a report from the National Restaurant Association (NRA), the U.S. restaurant industry is projected to reach $1.5 trillion in 2025.</p><h2>4 Restaurant Stocks With Upside</h2><h2>Brinker International, Inc.</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Brinker International, Inc.</strong> primarily owns, operates, develops and franchises various restaurants under the Chili&rsquo;s Grill &amp; Bar and Maggiano&rsquo;s Little Italy brands. EAT took over Chili&rsquo;s, Inc., a Texas corporation, in September 1983 and completed the acquisition of Maggiano&rsquo;s in August 1995. Chili&rsquo;s is a preeminent leader in the bar &amp; grill category of casual dining. The brand has been functioning for over the last 40 years.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Brinker International&rsquo;s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 98.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 47.1% over the past 60 days. EAT currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.</p><h2>Kura Sushi USA, Inc.</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kura Sushi USA, Inc.</strong> operates as a restaurant. KRUS offers nigiri, roll, hand roll, gunkan and desserts. Kura Sushi USA Inc. is based in Irvine.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Kura Sushi USA&rsquo;s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the past 60 days. Currently, KRUS carries a Zacks Rank #1.</p><h2>Darden Restaurants</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Darden Restaurants, Inc. </strong>is one of the largest casual dining restaurant operators worldwide. DRI has operations in the United States and Canada with more than 1,700 restaurants.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Darden Restaurants&rsquo; expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 7.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the past 60 days. DRI currently has a Zacks Rank #2.</p><h2>Potbelly</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Potbelly </strong>is a neighborhood sandwich concept. PBPB also offers sandwiches, salads, soups, chili, chips, cookies, ice cream and smoothies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Potbelly&rsquo;s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 60%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 14.3% over the past 60 days.&nbsp;PBPB currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417753/4-stocks-to-buy-as-restaurant-sales-soar-amid-price-challenges?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|investment_ideas-2417753">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 4 Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy for Stronger Portfolio Security ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 13:08:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Cybersecurity encompasses comprehensive security measures designed to protect systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks often aim to access, alter, or destroy sensitive information, extort money from users through ransomware, or disrupt the integrity of normal business operations.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, and increased digitization across both public and private sectors has heightened vulnerabilities and expanded attack surfaces, necessitating the development of advanced security solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here we recommend four stocks from the cybersecurity space with strong potential to provide double-digit returns in the short-term. These are <strong>CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. </strong>CRWD, <strong>CyberArk Software Ltd.</strong> CYBR, <strong>Palantir Technologies Inc.</strong> PLTR and <strong>Fortinet Inc.</strong> FTNT.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Huge Growth Potential for Cybersecurity Space</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The cybersecurity market has excellent growth opportunities for the future. Companies in this space offer integrated protection against evolving security threats while simplifying IT security infrastructure. The demand for advanced security solutions is rising owing to the increasing incidence of cyberattacks.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cybersecurity companies provide solutions to safeguard applications, networks, and cloud computing environments. Their offerings include application-specific integrated circuits, hardware architecture, operating systems, and associated security and networking functions, ensuring robust defenses against cyberattacks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At present, the global cybersecurity market size is around $190 - $210 billion. Several market researchers have estimated that this market size will likely reach $300 - $375 billion during 2028-2030.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Buy 4 Giant Cybersecurity Stocks and Hold for Long Term</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">These stocks have strong growth potential in 2025 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The chart below shows the price performance of our four picks year to date.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ef/94403.jpg?v=437795834" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">CrowdStrike Holdings, a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions in the United States and internationally, has been benefiting from the rising demand for cybersecurity solutions and the increasing need for secure networking products amid the growing hybrid working trend.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Continued digital transformation and cloud migration strategies adopted by organizations are the key growth drivers. CRWD&rsquo;s portfolio strength, mainly the Falcon platform&rsquo;s 22 cloud modules, boosts its competitive edge and helps add users.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CrowdStrike&rsquo;s success is rooted in continuous innovation, particularly in the wake of the July 2024 incident, which prompted the company to enhance its Falcon platform with advanced automated recovery techniques. These updates bolstered visibility, quality assurance and overall security, reassuring customers and strengthening trust in its solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Falcon platform now boasts more than 28 modules, spanning endpoint security, identity protection and next-gen SIEM, allowing CRWD to diversify its revenue streams. CRWD&rsquo;s ability to anticipate and respond to cybersecurity threats makes it a key partner for enterprises navigating an increasingly complex digital landscape.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A significant driver of CRWD&rsquo;s customer retention is the Falcon Flex subscription model, which simplifies security adoption by offering modular, scalable cybersecurity solutions. This flexibility encourages long-term commitments, ensuring steady revenue growth and deep customer integration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CrowdStrike Holdings has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 20.2% and 16.6%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.1% in the last 60 days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 34.5% compared with 12.3% for the S&amp;P 500.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CyberArk Software Ltd.</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">CyberArk Software is benefiting from the rising demand for cybersecurity and privileged access security solutions due to the long list of data breaches and increasing digital transformation strategies.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A strong presence across verticals, such as banking, healthcare, government and utilities, is safeguarding CYBR from the adverse effects of softening IT spending. CYBR&rsquo;s strategic mix shift toward software-as-a-service and subscription-based solutions is driving top-line growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CyberArk is gaining customer accounts, which contributes to its revenues. The vast customer base presents the company with an opportunity to upsell products within its installed user base. Furthermore, in the last few quarters, CYBR has been able to close a significant number of seven-figure deals.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The growing number of large deals in the revenue mix is a positive as it increases deferred revenues and visibility. Moreover, any product refresh brings in additional dollars as every enterprise attempts to keep its threat management infrastructure updated. These factors in turn support CYBR&rsquo;s top line.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CyberArk Software has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 31.5% and 18.2%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% in the last 30 days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 20% compared with 12.3% for the S&amp;P 500.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Palantir Technologies Inc.</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Palantir Technologies, the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered software platform and data analytics firm, reported robust earnings results for fourth-quarter 2024. Both the top and bottom lines exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, PLTR issued solid guidance for first-quarter and full-year 2025 revenues and earnings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Palantir Technologies&rsquo; commercial business has gathered pace besides its traditional government contracts. This is primarily due to PLTR&rsquo;s aggressive venture in the AI space. In 2023, PLTR launched its Artificial Intelligence Platform (&ldquo;AIP&rdquo;), an AI-powered system that helps customers quickly concentrate and analyze data and discover how it can help advance their business goals.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AIP provides unified access to open-source, self-hosted, and commercial large language models that can transform structured and unstructured data into LLM-understandable objects and turn organizations&#39; actions and processes into tools for humans and LLM-driven agents. This shift in revenue structure has enabled the company to no longer depend on government defense agencies.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Palantir Technologies has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 31.4% and 31.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.5% in the last 30 days. It has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 31.4% compared with 12.3% for the S&amp;P 500.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Fortinet Inc.</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Fortinet&rsquo;s fourth-quarter 2024 results reflect strength in demand from large enterprise customers and growth in the company&#39;s security subscriptions amid a slowdown in networking products, along with challenges in sales execution and marketing efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the growing adoption of Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) solutions could be a key growth driver for Fortinet in the long-run. The market research firm, MarketsAndMarkets, predicts that the market size for SD-WAN solutions could reach $13.7 billion by 2027 from $3.4 billion in 2022, indicating a CAGR of 31.9%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Continued deal wins, especially those of high value, are a key driver for FTNT. Higher IT spending on cybersecurity is further expected to aid FTNT in growing faster than the security market.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Global social media behemoth <strong>Meta Platforms Inc. </strong>META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly the Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">META&rsquo;s artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform is enhancing ad delivery efficiency and increasing return on ad spend for advertisers. Solid performance in spaces like e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and media is benefiting Meta Platforms.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strong Business Execution in Fourth-Quarter 2024</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">META has shown strong execution of its businesses as fourth-quarter 2024 earnings results handsomely beat both the top and bottom-line estimates. Family daily active people (DAP) was 3.35 billion versus the average estimate of 3.33 billion.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP) came in at $14.25 compared to the average estimate of $13.85. Advertising revenues were $46.78 billion compared to the consensus estimate of $45.43 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year increase of 20.9%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Instagram has emerged as an important cash cow for META supported by generative AI. The growing popularity of Reels has been a driving force. The company is using AI to recommend roughly 40% of the content that users see on Instagram.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Messenger and WhatsApp are extremely prized possessions of Meta platforms. Ephemerality and end-to-end encryption have driven the popularity of WhatsApp. The rapid adoption of WhatsApp Business by small and mid-sized enterprises is noteworthy. Moreover, increased communication enhances chances of META penetrating the lucrative payments market.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Significant Leverage on Artificial Intelligence&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to effectively connect people through Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. The company is exploring chat experiences in WhatsApp and Messenger, visual creation tools for posts on Facebook and Instagram and ads. Gradually, META is expected to introduce AI for video and multi-modal experiences. Meta believes AI tools will improve business messaging experience and customer support.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On July 24, 2024, META unveiled its Llama 3 AI model. Using NVIDIA&rsquo;s latest HDX H200 chip that supports Meta Platforms&rsquo; Llama 3 AI model, an investment of $1 by an API provider can generate $7 in revenues over the next four years. This mostly free Llama 3 model and its advanced version to be released next year aim to compete with incumbents like Open AI.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">META said that currently 4 million advertisers are using the company&rsquo;s generative AI tools to create ads, up from 1 million six months ago. <strong>NVIDIA Corp.</strong>&rsquo;s NVDA next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell, is the upcoming driver. META to get B200 Blackwell chips. Meta Platforms saw higher retention rates among advertisers using generative AI-powered image expansion, and background and text generation tools.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">META is set to spend $60-$65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 compared with $50 billion expected earlier. According to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, &quot;Investing very heavily in capital expenditure and infrastructure is going to be a strategic advantage over time.&quot;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta Platforms is trying hard to ensure that its next-generation open AI platform Lalma 4 becomes the best platform in this space. Zuckerberg said &ldquo;Llama 4 will be natively multimodal &mdash; it&#39;s an omni-model &mdash; and it will have agentic capabilities, so it&#39;s going to be novel and it&rsquo;s going to unlock a lot of new use cases.&rdquo;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Solid Estimate Revisions for META Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For first-quarter 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently shows revenues of $41.44 billion, suggesting an improvement of 13.7% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) of $5.61, indicating an increase of 19.1% year over year.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2025 earnings has improved 4.1% over the last 30 days. META reported positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters with an average beat of 13.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year increase of 14.6% and 11.7%, respectively, for revenues and EPS in 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has improved 5.9% over the last 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Even after this upward revision, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 revenues and EPS reflects an upside of 13.3% and 13.2%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 earnings has improved 6% over the last 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8b/94405.jpg?v=1771221839" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Attractive Valuation of META Shares</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta Platforms currently carries the forward P/E of 27.63X for the current financial year, compared with 29.86X of the industry and 18.88X of the S&amp;P 500. META has a return on equity of 38.17% compared with -0.62% of the industry and 16.94% of the S&amp;P 500 Index. META currently has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 18.3%, well above the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s long-term EPS growth rate of 12.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At present, the short-term average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents an increase of 0.9% from the last closing price of $716.37. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $935-$505. This indicates a maximum upside of 30.5% and a maximum downside of 29.5%.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/4f/94406.jpg?v=575609089" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">META Shares Flying High Year to Date</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta Platforms is witnessing an impressive rally in 2025 significantly outperforming other members of the &ldquo;magnificent 7&rdquo; group. Year to date, the stock price of META has jumped 22.2% compared with the 4.5% gain of the S&amp;P 500 and 3.9% of the Nasdaq Composite. The other six stocks have been underperforming these two indexes.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta Platforms has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow, which makes it an attractive stock for investors. As of Dec 31, 2024, cash &amp; cash equivalents and marketable securities were $77.82 billion and long-term debt was $28.83 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">META currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>. Meta Platforms continues to invest in developing its platform and products. We believe that its ability to generate strong cash flows will help it to make further investments in product development and acquisitions in the future.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The chart below shows the price performance of the &lsquo;magnificent 7&rsquo; stocks year to date.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/14/94404.jpg?v=1628108918" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417745/buy-meta-platforms-amid-solid-estimate-revisions-valuation-and-rally?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|investment_ideas-2417745">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Wall Street was upbeat last week, with the S&amp;P 500 adding 1.5%, the Dow Jones gaining about 0.6% and the Nasdaq surging 2.6%. Last week witnessed the release of hot January inflation data. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 3% in January from a year ago and surpassed market expectations by 2.9%, according to a Feb. 12 report from the Labor Department. This marks an uptick from 2.9% in December and an increase from the 3 1/2-year low of 2.4% recorded in September.</p><p>With the release of such hot inflation data, chances are lower that the Fed would cut rates faster this year. <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>&nbsp;MS has recently adjusted its forecast for U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, now expecting a single 25 basis point (bps) reduction this year,&nbsp;per Reuters, as quoted on Yahoo Finance. This is in line with projections from Barclays (BCS) and Macquarie. Previously, Morgan Stanley had anticipated two 25 bps cuts in March and June (read: Only One Rate Cut Expected in 2025? ETFs to Play).</p><p>Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of last week.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">ETFs in Focus &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></h2><p><strong>United States Natural Gas Fund LP</strong> UNG &ndash; Up 12.4%</p><p>The United States Natural Gas ETF LP is an exchange-traded security that is designed to track in percentage terms the movements of natural gas prices.

The ETF charges 99 bps in fees and yields 25.07% annually.</p><p><strong>KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF </strong>KWEB &ndash; Up 10%</p><p>The CSI Overseas China Internet Index is designed to measure the performance of the investable universe of publicly traded China-based companies whose primary business or businesses are in the Internet and Internet-related sectors.

The same for Chemical Intermediates sales stands at $103 million, indicating a decrease of 8.7% year over year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors at Play for ASIX Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AdvanSix, which produces nylon 6 resin, chemical intermediates and ammonium sulfate fertilizer, is benefiting from its differentiated product portfolio, exposure to diverse end markets and favorable demand and pricing. It is expected to have gained from improved nylon demand conditions and the growth of its differentiated products in the fourth quarter.<br /><br />While the building and construction market is a weak link due to the elevated interest rate environment, nylon demand remains firm in engineered plastics and packaging applications. The favorable agricultural industry fundamentals also bode well for ammonium sulfate.&nbsp;<br /><br />ASIX saw higher sales for nylon and ammonium sulfate in the third quarter of 2024. Ammonium sulfate sales were driven by strong sulfur nutrition demand. Favorable pricing also supported its performance. The demand strength in sulfur nutrition is expected to have continued in the fourth quarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, the company&rsquo;s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have been affected by the unfavorable impact of the extended turnaround. ASIX, on its third-quarter call, said that it sees a roughly $17 million unfavorable impact to pre-tax income in the fourth quarter resulting from an additional required maintenance and a delayed ramp to full operating rates at its Hopewell site following a plant turnaround.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>AdvanSix Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="AdvanSix Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/7e/1739959745.png" title="" width="533" /> <p>AdvanSix price-eps-surprise | AdvanSix Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What Our Model Unveils for ASIX</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AdvanSix this season.

<![CDATA[ Kimberly-Clark Up 7% in a Month: Is the Stock Still a Good Buy? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kimberly-Clark Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s KMB shares have gained 6.6% in the past month, outpacing the industry and the S&amp;P 500&#39;s growth of 0.2% and 1.8%, respectively. The company has outperformed the Consumer Staples sector which posted growth of 2.7%. This growth indicates Kimberly-Clark&#39;s ongoing commitment to innovation, operational efficiency and expanding its premium product offerings to meet the evolving demands for health, hygiene and sustainability.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">KMB Stock Past Month Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7c/94417.jpg?v=1906451227" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock last traded at $135.64, maintaining strong upward momentum and price stability, with its current price above 50-day simple moving averages of $130.42. Let us analyze the fundamentals of Kimberly-Clark to understand the key drivers behind its market position and financial resilience.</p><h2>Decoding KMB&rsquo;s Strategies</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Kimberly-Clark&#39;s Powering Care Strategy drives growth, efficiency and organizational alignment. The strategy focuses on three core areas, accelerating innovation, optimizing margins and restructuring for sustainable growth. The company invests in high-growth segments and cutting-edge innovations to enhance productivity. These efforts are designed to strengthen its global leadership position.<br /><br />Innovation is a central focus of Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s Powering Care strategy, with it launching new products across all price tiers. By offering unique, higher-value products, Kimberly-Clark aims to drive premiumization and meet evolving consumer demands, strengthening its brand. This strategy is designed to boost consumer loyalty and drive top-line growth in key categories.<br /><br />Kimberly-Clark achieved significant market share growth across several key regions in 2024, reinforcing its competitive positioning globally. In North America, the company saw an 80-basis point increase in its weighted market share within personal care categories. In China, Huggies gained 200 basis points, while Andrex and Kleenex saw increases in the United Kingdom. South Korea saw a 400-basis point gain in diapers and strong growth in feminine care was achieved in Australia and Indonesia.&nbsp;<br /><br />These gains highlight Kimberly-Clark&#39;s effective strategy, driven by superior products across the good-better-best price tiers and successful commercial strategies that have strengthened its brand and fostered consumer loyalty.</p><h2>KMB Stock Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite this uptick in the stock price, Kimberly-Clark is currently trading at a discount to its historical and industry benchmarks. KMB&rsquo;s forward 12-month price-to-earnings multiple is 17.95X, below its median level of 18.5X in the past year and lower than the industry&rsquo;s multiple of 21.25X. This implies that, relative to its earnings potential, the KMB stock might still be undervalued.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8d/94416.jpg?v=1282513949" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>What May Pull Back Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s Momentum?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Kimberly-Clark has been battling a dynamic consumer and retail environment, which is putting pressure on its performance. On its fourth-quarter 2024 earnings call, management highlighted that the demand has softened in North America&rsquo;s professional segment, while in emerging markets, like Southeast Asia and Latin America, economic pressures have led to reduced consumer purchasing frequency, particularly in markets with informal economies.<br /><br />Kimberly-Clark&rsquo;s extensive global presence makes it highly susceptible to foreign currency volatility. A stronger U.S. dollar pressures margins, especially when the company is unable to raise prices and pass the impact on to its customers. Currency headwinds have already affected performance, with the fourth quarter of 2024 revenues declining 0.8% year over year to $4.93 billion. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced sales by approximately 1.7%, while the divestiture of the Personal Protective Equipment business contributed to an additional 1.4% decline.&nbsp;<br /><br />Looking ahead to 2025, the company expects net sales to be adversely impacted by nearly 300 basis points, due to unfavorable currency rates. Operating profit growth is also anticipated to face a 300-basis-point drag from currency fluctuations. Additionally, EPS is expected to reflect an adverse impact of 350-400 basis points from currency translation, including the effect on income from equity interests.</p><h2>KMB&rsquo;s Consensus Estimates Showing Downtrend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Reflecting the negative sentiment around KMB, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter and fiscal 2025 has seen downward revisions. In the past 30 days, analysts have lowered estimates for the current quarter by 2.5% to $1.92 and for the current fiscal by 0.7% to $7.51 per share.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/5e/94415.jpg?v=1786526835" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Kimberly-Clark Stock Analysis</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Kimberly-Clark stock has demonstrated solid performance, driven by its strategic focus on innovation and operational efficiency. The company&#39;s Powering Care strategy, which emphasizes product premiumization and market expansion, has strengthened its competitive position globally. Despite strong growth in several key regions, challenges like foreign currency volatility and softening demand in some markets could dampen near-term momentum.&nbsp;<br /><br />While the stock appears undervalued relative to its earnings potential, cautious investors may prefer to wait for more favorable conditions before entering. Current investors may benefit from holding their positions. Kimberly-Clark presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><h2>Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ollie&#39;s Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc.</strong> OLLI operates as a retailer of brand-name merchandise in the United States and currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ollie&#39;s Bargain&rsquo;s current fiscal-year sales and earnings implies growth of 8.3% and 13.1%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers. OLLI delivered an earnings surprise of 5% in the trailing four quarters, on average.<br /><br /><strong>Ulta Beauty, Inc.</strong> ULTA operates as a specialty beauty retailer in the United States. It currently holds a Zacks Rank #2. ULTA delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.2%, on average.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ulta Beauty&rsquo;s current fiscal-year sales indicates growth of 0.6% from the year-ago reported numbers.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Arhaus, Inc.</strong> ARHS operates as a lifestyle brand and premium retailer in the home furnishings market in the United States. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. ARHS delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 124.5%, on average.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Arhaus&rsquo; current-quarter sales indicates growth of 2% from the year-ago reported numbers.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417726/kimberly-clark-up-7-in-a-month-is-the-stock-still-a-good-buy?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2417726">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Celsius Holdings Q4 Earnings on Deck: What to Expect From CELH? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:43:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Celsius Holdings, Inc. </strong>CELH is likely to witness a top and bottom-line decline when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 earnings on Feb. 20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $328.97 million, indicating a 5.3% drop from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.<br /><br />The consensus mark for earnings has dropped by a penny in the past 30 days to 11 cents per share, which suggests a 35.3% decrease from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. CELH has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 9.3%, on average.<br /><br /><em><strong>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Celsius Holdings Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise<br /><br /><img alt="Celsius Holdings Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/65/1739964270.png" title="" width="571" /> </h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Celsius Holdings Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Celsius Holdings Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CELH: Key Factors to Watch</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Celsius Holdings has been grappling with a mix of internal and external challenges. The company&rsquo;s 31% revenue decline in the third quarter of 2024 was a major setback, which stemmed from a significant inventory optimization adjustment from its primary distributor, PepsiCo. Although inventory levels are likely to have stabilized by the fourth quarter, this heavy reliance on a single partner remains a risk. Apart from this, broader macroeconomic pressures and lower discretionary spending have been affecting demand for CELH&rsquo;s products.<br /><br />Margins are another area of concern. The company&rsquo;s gross margin dropped 440 basis points to 46% in the third quarter, largely due to the full rollout of a PepsiCo incentive program designed to capture market share. However, this initiative has come at the expense of profitability. Sales and marketing expenses also remain elevated at 37.6% of revenues, reflecting Celsius Holdings&rsquo; commitment to enhancing brand visibility. The persistence of high operating costs raises concerns for the quarter under review.<br /><br />However, Celsius Holdings&rsquo; focus on innovation, branding and marketing has been aiding.&nbsp; By regularly launching new flavors and product variations, CELH has been addressing shifting consumer preferences. Another key strength lies in the company&rsquo;s expansive retail presence.&nbsp; Celsius Holdings has secured prime shelf space in major retail chains, convenience stores and online platforms, enhancing its reach. Its diverse distribution strategy, including e-commerce and foodservice channels, further bolsters revenues.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Whispers for CELH Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model doesn&rsquo;t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Celsius Holdings this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.<br /><br />Celsius Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of -3.74%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks With the Favorable Combination</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some companies worth considering, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.<br /><br /><strong>Costco Wholesale </strong>COST currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.56% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is likely to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2025 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Costco&rsquo;s quarterly revenues is pegged at $63.2 billion, which suggests 8.2% growth from the prior-year quarter. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong><br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Costco&rsquo;s quarterly earnings per share is pegged at $4.09, indicating a 10.2% increase from the year-ago period. COST has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2%, on average.<br /><br /><strong>Urban Outfitters</strong> URBN currently has an Earnings ESP of +8.58% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.63 billion, which indicates growth of 9.4% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Urban Outfitters&rsquo; fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 EPS is pegged at 89 cents, which implies an almost 29% increase year over year. URBN has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 22.8%, on average.<br /><br /><strong>Sprouts Farmers Market </strong>SFM currently has an Earnings ESP of +9.58% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is likely to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprouts Farmers&rsquo; quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.95 billion, which suggests an increase of 14.8% from the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprouts Farmers&rsquo; quarterly earnings per share is pegged at 72 cents, indicating 47% growth from the year-ago period. SFM has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 15.3%, on average.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417714/celsius-holdings-q4-earnings-on-deck-what-to-expect-from-celh?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2417714">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ What to Expect From These 3 MedTech Stocks This Earnings Season? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:20:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">As the fourth-quarter earnings season progresses, this week will be crucial for many companies in the medical device sector. According to the latest Earnings Preview report, the Medical sector is poised for strong revenue and earnings growth. These gains are likely to have been driven by the sustained demand for medical products and services, along with strategic pricing initiatives, which are expected to have counterbalanced challenges such as global geopolitical uncertainties, supply challenges and healthcare labor shortages.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Going by the broader Medical sector&rsquo;s scorecard, 72.1% of the companies in the Medical sector, constituting 91.4% of the sector&rsquo;s market capitalization, reported earnings till Feb. 12. The bottom line improved 16.9% year over year despite 10.1% higher revenues. Of the companies that have already reported, 72.7% beat on both earnings and revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, fourth-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to improve 13.4% on 9.6% growth in revenues. This compares with the third-quarter earnings increase of 7.8% on revenue growth of 10.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The bottom-line expectations for the fourth quarter look promising compared to the third-quarter performance, primarily due to improving demand, healthy capital budgets and rising prices. However, some supply-chain issues arising due to the impact of hurricanes in the United States may impede growth. With a strong dollar, FX headwinds might also have aggravated during the fourth quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A few industry players like <strong>Glaukos Corporation</strong> GKOS, <strong>Integer Holdings</strong> ITGR and <strong>AMN Healthcare Services</strong> AMN are set to report their quarterly results tomorrow.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Driving the Q4 MedTech Earnings Season</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The U.S. medical instruments sector demonstrated solid performance in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by strong revenue growth, technological advancements and a rebound in elective procedures. Major industry players, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and Medtronic, reported mid-single-digit revenue increases, with notable gains in their MedTech and specialized device segments. Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s MedTech division saw 6.7% operational growth, while Medtronic&rsquo;s heart devices and diabetes units posted gains of 6.3% and 10.4%, respectively, reinforcing the sector&rsquo;s resilience.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Several macroeconomic factors supported this momentum. The rising demand for medical procedures, particularly among an aging population, fueled revenue expansion. Additionally, the integration of AI and robotics in device manufacturing enhanced operational efficiency, boosting profitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, challenges remain. Supply-chain disruptions, including a hurricane-induced IV fluid shortage, temporarily impacted hospital operations, leading to some deferred procedures. Nonetheless, analysts expect these disruptions to be short-lived, with minimal long-term effects on the industry&rsquo;s overall trajectory.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MedTech Stocks to Watch</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Glaukos </strong>demonstrated a robust 24% year-over-year sales improvement in the third quarter, driven primarily by the success of its iDose TR product and U.S. glaucoma franchise. This trend is likely to have continued in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">iDose TR sales are being fueled by strong market adoption, clinical efficacy in sustaining intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction for up to three years, and its ability to improve patient compliance compared to traditional daily eye drops. The product&rsquo;s successful U.S. launch and positive surgeon feedback have accelerated adoption, and Glaukos continues to invest in next-generation glaucoma therapies, further bolstering its market position.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company also raised its full-year revenue guidance to $377-$379 million on its last earnings call, reflecting confidence in continued market penetration. With the forthcoming NDA submission for Epioxa, a next-generation corneal cross-linking therapy, GKOS is positioned for sustained growth. The company may provide an update on the progress with the submission on the fourth-quarter earnings call.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $100.8 million, suggesting a 22.3% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at a loss of 43 cents per share, indicating a 31.8% improvement from the year-ago reported loss.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">During the quarter, the company&rsquo;s shares rose 15.1% against the industry&rsquo;s 6.6% decline.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating on earnings. However, this is not the case here, as you can see below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GKOS has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Glaukos Corporation Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Glaukos Corporation Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/19/1739961000.png" title="" width="582" /> <p>Glaukos Corporation price-eps-surprise | Glaukos Corporation Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Integer Holdings</strong> reported a 9% year-over-year revenue increase, with 17% growth in its adjusted operating income. Its year-to-date sales of $1.27 billion highlight its resilience amid macroeconomic pressures. Improved margins and enhanced operational efficiencies have led to revised earnings per share guidance, signaling confidence in sustained profitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Margin improvement is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter, driven by strategic cost-cutting initiatives, optimization of manufacturing processes and disciplined pricing strategies. Additionally, Integer is likely to have benefited from automation enhancements and supply-chain efficiencies, which must have helped offset inflationary pressures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $446.2 million, suggesting a rise of 8% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS of $1.46 indicates a year-over-year improvement of 5%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">During the fourth quarter, the stock rose 1.9% against the industry&rsquo;s 6.6% decline.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ITGR has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Integer Holdings Corporation Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Integer Holdings Corporation Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/4d/1739961115.png" title="" width="583" /> <p>Integer Holdings Corporation price-eps-surprise | Integer Holdings Corporation Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AMN Healthcare</strong>&rsquo;s decline in the majority of its segmental revenues during the third quarter was worrying, a trend that is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter. The contraction of both margins is also likely to have persisted. AMN Healthcare expects to register a decline in its overall top line and the majority of its segments for the fourth quarter of 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the uptick in the segmental revenues of Physician and Leadership Solutions, locum tenens and Language interpretation services is likely to have offset some of the declines. Management confirmed that AMN Healthcare made progress on its market growth strategy with sequential improvements in the overall sales pipeline, Managed Services Program net wins and internal fill rates. This trend is likely to be reflected in fourth-quarter results as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMN Healthcare&rsquo;s quarterly revenues is pegged at $695.1 million, indicating a decrease of 15.1% from the year-ago reported figure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter EPS suggests a 60.6% decline to 52 cents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, during the fourth quarter, shares of the company lost 43.6% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 16.8% decline.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AMN has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>AMN Healthcare Services Inc Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="AMN Healthcare Services Inc Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/d9/1739961163.png" title="" width="572" /> <p>AMN Healthcare Services Inc price-eps-surprise | AMN Healthcare Services Inc Quote</p></div><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417697/what-to-expect-from-these-3-medtech-stocks-this-earnings-season?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview_esp-2417697">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>National Vision Holdings, Inc.&nbsp;</strong>EYE is strengthening its foundation with leadership changes, expanded exam capacity and other strategic initiatives. Favorable optical retail industry statistics bode well for the company&rsquo;s growth potential in the upcoming quarters. Furthermore, America&#39;s Best brand is boosting revenues, leveraging the ongoing strength of managed care. Meanwhile, a negative solvency position and escalated expenses pose concerns for National Vision&rsquo;s operations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has fallen 40.6% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 0.1% decline and the S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s 24% rise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The leading optical retailer has a market capitalization of $978.9 million. National Vision surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 93.7%, on average.</p><h2>Tailwinds for EYE</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Future Strategies Look Promising: </strong>National Vision is advancing its transformation efforts with new additions to the leadership team, continued expansion of exam capacity, new traffic-driving initiatives and efforts to strengthen its business foundation for profitable growth. &nbsp;It recently completed a comprehensive store fleet review to align its real estate investments with higher standards, optimize profitability for the long term and improve the overall health of the core business. The results of this review include a plan to close 39 stores through 2026, which is expected to deliver approximately $4 million in adjusted EBITDA improvement by the end of that year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">National Vision has temporarily moderated new store openings to 30-35 America&rsquo;s Best stores in fiscal 2025, mostly all in remote-enabled states. Through these actions, the company expects to gain more flexibility to invest in the existing operations and deploy capital to initiatives that drive revenue growth and improve profitability. Furthermore, National Vision sees substantial potential for growth, with a whitespace opportunity of at least 2,500 stores, which is more than double the existing store count across its brands.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Favorable Industry Trends: </strong>National Vision operates in the U.S. optical retail industry, demonstrating consistent growth and resilience to economic cycles largely due to the medical, nondiscretionary and recurring eye care purchases. According to a 2023 report by the Vision Council, 82% of respondents use a form of vision correction, 69% use prescription eyewear, and 68% use some form of non-prescription eyewear. Further, a 2023 WHO report states that nearly 2.2 billion individuals around the globe have a vision impairment, of which 1 billion have a vision impairment that is yet to be addressed.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/5d/94402.jpg?v=548755914" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Leading causes of distance vision impairment or blindness are cataract, refractive error, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, while presbyopia mainly causes near vision impairment. The frequent replacement cycle marked by the repetitive and foreseeable nature of customer behavior, resulting in a substantial volume of recurring revenues for the optical retail industry, is another trending factor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Owned &amp; Host Gaining Market Share: </strong>Of the four sub-segments within Owned and Host, America&#39;s Best is particularly driving revenues banking on the ongoing strength of managed care. Recently, the brand introduced the Wide Buys promotion to enhance value offerings and attract new customers. The response for the first-ever &ldquo;two pairs for $129.95, including an eye exam&rdquo; progressive offer was positive. Following this, a new entry progressive bundled offer was launched that provides an ongoing everyday value. Also, in the third quarter of 2024, America&rsquo;s Best became the exclusive U.S. retail partner of the Florence by Mills eyewear collection and launched an exclusive partnership with Pair Eyewear nationwide.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">National Vision is deploying remote medicine technology in tandem with electronic health record technology to drive expanded capacity, improve in-store efficiencies and boost patient experience. The combination of these initiatives is resulting in added exam capacity in sales that the company would not have otherwise.</p><h2>Concerns for National Vision</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mounting Expenses: </strong>Over the past few years, global markets and economic conditions have been challenging, particularly in light of rising interest rates and historic inflation throughout 2023 and global conflict, which has created continued economic uncertainty. In this regard, the company made targeted wage investments, including increasing compensation for optometrists and associates, as well as flexibility initiatives, which have and will continue to impact costs related to revenues, such as selling, general and administrative expenses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Solvency and Capital Structure: </strong>National Vision exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $81.2 million and short-term debt of $101 million on its balance sheet. This is not good news in terms of the company&rsquo;s solvency position, particularly during the time of macroeconomic headwinds when it is majorly facing supply issues globally. Added to this, long-term debt increased by nearly 75% from the second quarter, reaching $253 million.</p><h2>EYE Stock Estimate Trend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for National Vision&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share (EPS) has increased 4.1% to 52 cents in the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s 2024 revenues is pegged at $1.84 billion. This suggests a 13.3% decline from the year-ago reported number.</p><h2>Top MedTech Stocks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are <strong>Veracyte</strong> VCYT, <strong>Phibro Animal Health </strong>PAHC and <strong>Boston Scientific</strong> BSX.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Veracyte has an estimated 2024 earnings growth rate of 209.8% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 15.4%. Veracyte&rsquo;s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 520.6%. Its shares have surged 61.4% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 5.2% growth in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">VCYT sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here<strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Phibro Animal Health, also sporting a Zacks Rank #1 at present, has an estimated earnings growth rate of 54.6% for fiscal 2025 compared with the industry&rsquo;s 14.8%. Shares of the company have surged 111.3% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 13% growth over the past year. PAHC&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 27.1%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Boston Scientific, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has an earnings yield of 2.7% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 1.3%. Shares of the company have rallied 59.1% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 13% growth. BSX&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 8.3%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417695/is-it-the-right-time-to-hold-eye-stock-in-your-portfolio-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2417695">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Penumbra, Inc.&nbsp;</strong>PEN reported fourth-quarter 2024&nbsp;adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 97 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.5%. Adjusted EPS improved 27.6% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks </em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">GAAP earnings were 86 cents per share compared with $1.38 in the prior-year period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the full year, adjusted earnings were $2.22 compared to the year-ago period&rsquo;s figure of $2.09.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Penumbra registered revenues of $315.5 million in the reported quarter, up 10.8% year over year on a reported basis and at a constant exchange rate or CER.

Adjusted revenues were $1.20 billion, up 13.4% in adjusted CER compared to 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Following the earnings announcement, shares of PEN rose 8.6% in after-market trading yesterday.</p><h2>Penumbra&rsquo;s Q4 Results in Detail</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reports under two geographical segments &mdash; <strong>the United States</strong> and <strong>International</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PEN recorded adjusted revenues of $247.9 million (77.2% of adjusted total revenues) in the United States, up 21.7% year over year on a reported basis as well as adjusted CER.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted revenues in the International segment dropped 16.5% on a reported basis (down 9.1% in adjusted CER) to $73.4 million (22.8% of adjusted total revenues).</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Penumbra, Inc.

Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">The company currently reports its product revenues under two categories &mdash; <strong>Thrombectomy</strong>, and <strong>Embolization and Access</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company registered adjusted revenues of $222.7 million from sales of Thrombectomy products, up 15.4% on a reported basis and 16.9% in adjusted CER.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted sales of Embolization and Access products totaled $98.6 million, up 1.6% on a reported basis and 5.1% in adjusted CER.</p><h3>PEN&rsquo;s Q4 Margin Performance</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">In the reported quarter, Penumbra&rsquo;s gross profit improved 12.7% year over year to $210.7 million. The gross margin expanded 110 basis points to 66.8% despite a 7.3% rise in the cost of revenues.

The company&rsquo;s U.S. thrombectomy business continued to fuel growth, with its comprehensive and proprietary CAVT portfolio maintaining momentum throughout the quarter and closing the year in a strong position.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Penumbra commenced the commercial rollout of Lightning Bolt 12, bringing its proprietary modulated aspiration technology to the venous anatomy and larger arteries, offering the latest generation CAVT solution for these vessel sizes. Early feedback has been positive, with further expansion planned in 2025. Expansion of both margins is also highly encouraging.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, International revenues registered a decline to a reduction in China revenues.</p><h2>PEN&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, Penumbra carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are <strong>ResMed</strong> RMD, <strong>Cardinal Health</strong> CAH and <strong>Bio-Rad</strong> <strong>Laboratories</strong> BIO.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ResMed reported second-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS of $2.43, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.6%.

While SM Energy and NextDecade presently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, Range Resources carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).&nbsp;You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SM Energy is set to expand its oil-centered operations in the coming years, with an increasing focus on crude oil, especially in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford regions. The company&rsquo;s attractive oil and gas investments should create long-term value for shareholders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NextDecade is an emerging player in the LNG space with its Rio Grande LNG project in Texas. As demand for LNG continues to grow, NextDecade&rsquo;s strategic investments in infrastructure and its planned liquefaction capacity provide strong upside potential. With the global LNG market expanding, the company is well-positioned to tap into the increasing export demand from the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Range Resources is among the top 10 natural gas producers in the United States. Its&nbsp;diversified portfolio is spread between low-risk and long reserve-life Appalachian assets. The company&rsquo;s extensive inventory of Marcellus resources with low breakeven points is a significant asset. With expanded LPG export capacity, RRC is well-positioned to meet the rising global demand, capitalizing on natural gas&#39; role as a cleaner-burning fuel amid a low-carbon shift.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417690/eqt-beats-q4-earnings-revenue-estimates-on-higher-production?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2417690">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I could get used to a market like this. All-time highs nearly every day? Yes, please! But, we can&rsquo;t rest on our laurels around here. The market has a funny way of surprising us the most when everyone is starting to get a little too greedy and a little too complacent.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">That doesn&rsquo;t mean that we can&rsquo;t celebrate the big winners we see them. There are a ton of stocks out there that are rallying for good reasons, and are seeing their earnings move instep with those stock prices. The Zacks Rank helps us uncover those stocks with the strongest earnings trends. Trends like we see in today&rsquo;s Bull of the Day.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Today&rsquo;s Bull of the Day is Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) <strong>Roku (</strong></span></span>ROKU<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>). </strong>Roku is a leading company in the streaming media industry, primarily known for its digital media players and smart TV operating system. The company&rsquo;s business is centered around three key areas, Streaming devices and Smart TVs, advertising and content distribution, as well as platform services and subscriptions.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank is that Roku&rsquo;s last earnings report prompted several analysts around Wall Street to increase their earnings estimates for the current year and next year. On February 13<sup>th</sup>, the company reported a beat on both top and bottom lines, while guiding initial FY25 revenues of $4.61 billion.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/bc/94400.jpg?v=501927865" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As a result, analysts bumped up their expectations for both the current year and next year. Our current year Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for a loss of 80 cents, up from a loss of 93 cents sixty days ago. Next year&rsquo;s number has pushed up to a profit of a dime versus expectations for a nickel loss.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">A quick look at the Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart shows the consistency recently in Roku&rsquo;s earnings. Five consecutive quarterly earnings beats for the company now. Estimates continue to start lower and spend the year ticking higher. That&rsquo;s exactly what you want to see from a long-term winner. Roku is still well off its all-time highs which sit over $450. The stock is currently trading below $100.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417633/bull-of-the-day-roku-roku?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-bull_of_the_day-2417633">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Steel ETF (SLX) Hits New 52-Week High ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">For investors seeking momentum,&nbsp;<strong>VanEck Steel ETF </strong>SLX is probably on the radar. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up 29.7% from its 52-week low of $57.31per share.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea of where it might be headed:</p><h2>SLX in Focus</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The underlying NYSE Arca Steel Index tracks the overall performance of companies involved in the steel sector. The ETF charges 56 bps in annual fees. The ETF yields 3.28% annually (see:&nbsp;all the Materials ETFs here).</p><h2>Why the Move?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">President Donald Trump signed an executive order in early February imposing a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports from all countries.The tariffs, set to take effect on March 4, apply without exceptions or exemptions. Steel ETF SLX has been in great shape following the announcement of Trump tariffs (read: ETFs to Win/Lose as Trump Imposes 25% Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum).</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">More Gains Ahead?</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The SLX ETF might not continue its strong performance in the near term, with a&nbsp;negative weighted alpha of 8.15 (as per Barchart.com). Its potential for further run could be limited.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417683/steel-etf-slx-hits-new-52-week-high?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2417683">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 3 Top-Ranked Energy Mutual Funds for Amazing Returns ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The recent war between Israel and the Palestine-based militant group Hamas has affected the global supply chain. Also, the prevailing war between Russia and Ukraine has prompted several governments, including the United States, to impose sanctions on Russian oil and energy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Crude prices have gone up on supply concerns from Russia, which is one of the world&rsquo;s biggest producers of the commodity. Prices have risen further after the U.S. government imposed a ban on the import of oil and other energy products.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Geopolitical tensions are likely to keep markets volatile for some time, with the energy sector making the most of the opportunity. So, investing in funds with exposure to energy equities is expected to help in the near term.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Below, we share with you three top-ranked energy mutualfunds, viz.,<strong> BNY Mellon Natural Resources Fund </strong>DNLAX, <strong>Invesco SteelPath MLP Select 40 </strong>MLPFX and <strong>Fidelity Natural Resources Fund </strong>FNARX. Each has a&nbsp;Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1&nbsp;(Strong Buy) and is expected to outperform its peers in the future. Investors can&nbsp;click here to see the complete list of energy mutual funds.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BNY Mellon Natural Resources</strong><strong> Fund</strong> invests most of its assets in securities of domestic and foreign companies, including those in emerging markets, with major exposure in natural resources and natural-resources-related sectors, irrespective of market capitalization. DNLAX advisors choose to invest in growth and value stocks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BNY Mellon Natural Resources Fund has three-year annualized returns of 10%. As of September 2024, DNLAX held 41 issues, with 4.8% of its assets invested in Freeport-McMoran.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Invesco SteelPath MLP Select 40 </strong>invests most of its net assets in master limited partnerships (MLPs) and MLP-related securities. It primarily invests in issuers engaged in the transportation, storage, processing, refining, marketing, exploration, production and mining of minerals and natural resources.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Invesco SteelPath MLP Select 40 has three-year annualized returns of 24.1%. Stuart Cartner has been one of the fund managers of MLPFX since April 2010.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fidelity Natural Resources Fund</strong> primarily invests in the common stocks of companies that own or develop natural resources and precious metals. FNARX advisors use fundamental analysis of factors like each issuer&#39;s financial condition and industry position, as well as market and economic conditions, to arrive at their investment decision.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Fidelity Natural Resources Fund has three-year annualized returns of 12.4%.

<![CDATA[ Bear of the Day: Constellation Brands (STZ) ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Markets are rocking and rolling, up at all-time highs with no signs of stopping. Of course, we all know that it can&rsquo;t last forever. And when it comes time to pay the piper, the brutality will be swift. During that time, it&rsquo;s best to find stocks with strong earnings trends which have retreated in price. You won&rsquo;t want to be left holding the bag in a stock that&rsquo;s down in price, and has seen its earnings move in the wrong direction.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Today&rsquo;s Bear of the Day is a stock that has seen its earnings estimates move in the wrong direction. I&rsquo;m talking about Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) <strong>Constellation Brands (</strong></span></span>STZ<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>). </strong>Constellation Brands is a leading producer and marketer of alcoholic beverages, specializing in beer, wine, and spirits. The company owns popular beer brands like Corona, Modelo, and Pacifico in the U.S., along with a premium wine and spirits portfolio that includes Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, and Svedka Vodka. Constellation focuses on brand innovation, strategic acquisitions, and premiumization to drive growth in the beverage alcohol industry.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Constellation Brands is not in the good graces of our Zacks Rank. The reason is that nine analysts have cut their earnings expectations for the current year over the last sixty days, while eight have done so for next year. The bearish moves have dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $13.72 to $13.50 while next year&rsquo;s number is off from $15.02 to $14.44.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">From a valuation perspective, the good news for investors is that Constellation is trading at 12x earnings. That&rsquo;s cheaper than the industry average of 12.8x. If the company can right the ship and hold earnings steady, there&rsquo;s a real chance at recovery.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Constellation is in the Beverages &ndash; Alcohol industry which ranks in the Bottom 10% of our Zacks Industry Rank. There is one name in the industry which is in the good graces of our Zacks Industry Rank. That&rsquo;s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) <strong>Kirin (</strong></span></span>KNBWY<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>)</strong>. There are several Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks including <strong>Molson Coors (</strong></span></span>TAP<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>)</strong>.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417642/bear-of-the-day-constellation-brands-stz?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-bear_of_the_day-2417642">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Transocean Ltd.&nbsp;</strong>RIG reported a fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted net loss of 9 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a profit of 1 cent. This underperformance can be attributed to year-over-year higher costs and expenses. However, the bottom line was in line with the year-ago level.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks </em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This Switzerland-based offshore drilling powerhouse&rsquo;s total adjusted revenues of $952 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $959 million due to poor revenue efficiency and weak average revenues per day from its segments. However, the top line increased 27.3% from the prior-year figure of $748 million. This was due to higher-than-expected revenues from ultra-deepwater and harsh environment floaters. Ultra-deepwater and harsh environment revenues surpassed the respective consensus mark of $667 million and $244 million.&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Transocean Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Transocean Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/7d/1739953387.png" title="" width="565" /> <p>Transocean Ltd. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Transocean Ltd. Quote</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><h2>Transocean&rsquo;s Segmental Revenue Breakup</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Transocean&rsquo;s ultra-deepwater floaters contributed 71% to net contract drilling revenues, while harsh environment floaters accounted for the remaining 29%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues from the ultra-deepwater and harsh environment floaters totaled $675 million and $277 million, respectively, compared with the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figures of $536 million and $205 million. However, revenues from ultra-deepwater and harsh environment operations missed the model prediction of $679.8 million and $280.2 million, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues efficiency was 93.5%, a&nbsp;decrease from the previous quarter&#39;s 94.5%. This was also lower than the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s 97%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2>RIG&rsquo;s Day Rates, Utilization &amp; Backlog&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Average day rates in the reported quarter increased to $434,700 from $407,800 in the year-ago quarter. However, the figure missed the model prediction of $461,400.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Average revenues per day from ultra-deepwater floaters decreased to $428,200 from $432,100 in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the figure missed the model estimation of $453,400.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The same from harsh environment floaters also decreased to $452,600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from $464,900 in the comparable period of 2023. Moreover, the figure missed the model prediction of $482,100.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Fleet utilization rate was 66.8% in the quarter, which increased from the prior-year period&rsquo;s 51.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Transocean&rsquo;s backlog of $8.3 billion decreased sequentially from $9.3 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2>RIG&rsquo;s Costs, Capex &amp; Balance Sheet</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reported $815 million in costs and expenses, which was 1.5% higher than the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level of $803 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Operating and maintenance expenses (O&amp;M) rose to $579 million from $569 million a year ago. General and administrative expenses (G&amp;A) rose to $56 million from the prior-year figure of $50 million. However, depreciation and amortization decreased to $180 million from the prior-year figure of $190 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The oil and gas drilling company spent $29 million on capital investments in the fourth quarter. Cash used in operating activities was $206 million. The company generated a free cash flow of $177 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cash and cash equivalents were $560 million as of Dec. 31, 2024. Long-term debt amounted to $6.2 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 37.6% as of the same period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2>Guidance for Transocean</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company expects first-quarter O&amp;M expenses to be between $610 million and $630 million, with G&amp;A expenses ranging from $50 million to $55 million. Capital expenditures for the first quarter are forecasted at about $59 million and cash taxes are expected to be around $13 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the full year, O&amp;M expenses are expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion, in line with the prior guidance. G&amp;A expenses for the year are anticipated to be between $190 million and $200 million. The company expects net interest expense for the year to be between $550 million and $555 million, including an interest expense of about $580 million and interest income in the range of $25-$30 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cash taxes for the full year are expected to be between $65 million and $70 million. These estimations are consistent with previous guidance and reflect the company&rsquo;s focus on maintaining financial discipline and supporting long-term growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2>Important Earnings at a Glance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">While we have discussed RIG&rsquo;s fourth-quarter results in detail, let us take a look at three other key reports of this space.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Oil and gas equipment and services provider <strong>Liberty Energy</strong> LBRT reported a fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted net income of 10 cents per share, which marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents, due to a year-over-year decrease in costs and expenses.&nbsp; However, the bottom line underperformed the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure of 54 cents, due to poor equipment and service execution, along with lower activity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, Liberty had approximately $20 million in cash and cash equivalents. The pressure pumper&rsquo;s long-term debt of $190.5 million represented a debt-to-capitalization of 8.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Another oil and gas equipment and services provider <strong>Halliburton Company</strong> HAL posted a fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted net income per share of 70 cents, same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate but below the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s profit of 86 cents (adjusted). The numbers indicated softer activity in the region of North America, partly offset by improved fluid work in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><div><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, the company had approximately $2.6 billion in cash/cash equivalents and $7.2 billion in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 40.4. The company generated $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter, leading to a free cash flow of $1.1 billion.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Energy infrastructure provider <strong>Kinder Morgan</strong> KMI reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 32 cents, shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 33 cents. The lower-than-expected quarterly earnings were primarily due to decreased volumes on certain systems, asset divestitures and lower crude, CO2 and NGL volumes. KMI&rsquo;s fourth-quarter DCF was $1.3 billion, up from $1.2 billion a year ago.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, Kinder Morgan reported $88 million in cash and cash equivalents. Its long-term debt amounted to $29.8 billion at the quarter-end. For 2025, Kinder Morgan anticipates a net income of $2.8 billion, up 8% from the prior-year level, and an adjusted EPS of $1.27, up 10%. The company expects to declare dividends of $1.17 per share, up 2% from the prior-year figure. It also anticipates budgeted adjusted EBITDA of $8.3 billion, up 4% from the previous-year level.</p></div><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417677/transocean-incurs-loss-in-fourth-quarter-misses-on-revenues?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2417677">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Petr&oacute;leo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras&nbsp;</strong>PBR has started oil production from its deepwater project offshore southeast Brazil with its largest floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) unit, Almirante Tamandar&eacute;.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Overview of PBR&rsquo;s FPSO Almirante Tamandar&eacute;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Almirante Tamandar&eacute; is the largest FPSO installed at Petrobras&#39; B&uacute;zios field. The unit was leased from SBM Offshore to enhance Petrobras&rsquo; oil and gas output. Apart from featuring an above-average capacity, the FPSO is also equipped with decarbonization technologies, which help reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. The high-capacity FPSO has the potential to produce up to 225,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) and process 12 million cubic meters of gas daily.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">An Insight Into B&uacute;zios Oil Field</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The B&uacute;zios oil field, a large ultra-deepwater oil field located in the&nbsp;Santos Basin, off the coast of&nbsp;Brazil, lies in a water depth of about 1,900-2,200 m. Petrobras is the operator of the Buzios oil field with an 88.89% stake and is partnered with CNOOC Ltd., holding a 7.34% stake and China National Petroleum Corporation, holding a 3.67% stake. Additionally, PPSAoversees the production-sharing contracts for this consortium.The B&uacute;zios field is said to be the largest field in the world in ultra-deep waters, which already accounts for over 20% of Petrobras&rsquo; total production.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How Will the FPSO Benefit PBR?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Almirante Tamandar&eacute; FPSO is connected to 15 wells through a subsea infrastructure, comprising oil producers, injectors and a convertible well, ensuring efficient resource extraction. It is part of the sixth production system of B&uacute;zios and is expected to help reach a total output of 1 million barrels per day by 2025. Looking ahead, Petrobras aims to double that capacity to 2 million barrels per day by 2030, which will further solidify its presence in Brazil.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PBR&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Petrobras is the largest integrated energy firm in Brazil and one of the largest in Latin America.&nbsp;Currently, PBR has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the energy&nbsp;sector might look at some top-ranked stocks like <strong>SM Energy Company&nbsp;</strong>SM, <strong>Prairie Operating Co. </strong>PROP and&nbsp;<strong>Gulfport Energy Corporation&nbsp;</strong>GPOR.While SM Energy and PROP currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, Gulfport Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 19, 2025 &ndash; Stocks in this week&rsquo;s article are Tapestry, Inc. TPR, RTX Corp. RTX, Cintas Corp. CTAS, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Corning Inc. GLW.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>5 Dividend Stocks Investors May Bank On for Growth</em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Dividend investing remains one of the hottest segments of the stock market. Though U.S. stocks have been hovering near record highs on Trump&rsquo;s growth policies and ongoing AI adoption, geopolitics, fears of a trade war, inflationary pressure and uncertain Fed moves continue to weigh on investors&rsquo; sentiment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In such a scenario, dividends are major sources of consistent income for investors though they do not offer dramatic price appreciation. Stocks backed by regular dividends can reduce the volatility of a portfolio and also tend to outperform in a choppy market. In particular, focusing on the growth level in this strategy leads to higher returns. Zeroing in on stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have selected five dividend growth stocks &mdash; <strong>Tapestry, Inc.</strong>, <strong>RTX Corp.</strong>, <strong>Cintas Corp.</strong>, <strong>Broadcom Inc</strong>. and <strong>Corning Inc.</strong> &mdash; that could be solid choices.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Dividend Growth?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just seven.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are five of the seven stocks that fit the bill:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">New York-based <strong>Tapestry</strong>, which was formerly known as Coach, is the designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men in the United States and internationally. The stock saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 7 cents over the past seven days for the fiscal year (ending June 2025) and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 14.4%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tapestry has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Massachusetts-based <strong>RTX</strong> is an aerospace and defense company, providing advanced systems and services for commercial, military and government customers worldwide. The stock saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 6 cents over the past 30 days for this year with an estimated earnings growth rate of 7%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">RTX has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ohio-based <strong>Cintas </strong>provides specialized services to businesses of all types throughout North America. It also operates in Europe, Asia and Latin America. The company designs, manufactures and implements corporate identity uniform programs. It also provides entrance mats, restroom supplies, promotional products and first aid and safety products for diversified businesses. Cintas has an estimated earnings growth rate of 13.7% for the fiscal year (ending May 2025) and delivered an average earnings surprise of 7.70% for the past four quarters.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cintas has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">California-based <strong>Broadcom</strong> is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices focused on complex digital and mixed-signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V based products. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision by a penny for the fiscal year (ending October 2025) over the past 30 days and has an expected earnings growth rate of 29.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Broadcom has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">New York-based <strong>Corning</strong> started as a glass business that was reincorporated in 1936. The company has since developed its glass technologies to produce advanced glass substrates that are used in a large number of applications across multiple markets. The stock saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for this year over the past 30 days and has an expected earnings growth rate of 18.9%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Corning has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 19, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Home Depot, Inc. HD, Booking Holdings Inc. BKNG, Eaton Corp. plc ETN and Value Line, Inc. VALU.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Here are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Top Analyst Reports for Home Depot, Booking and Eaton</em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today&#39;s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Home Depot, Inc., Booking Holdings Inc. and Eaton Corp. plc, as well as a micro-cap stock Value Line, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.<br /><br />These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.<br /><br />You can <strong>see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><u>Ahead of Wall Street</u></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The daily &#39;Ahead of Wall Street&#39; article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day&#39;s trading action. The article comes out before the market&#39;s open and attempts to make sense of that morning&#39;s economic releases and how they will affect that day&#39;s market action. You can read this article for free on our home page and can actually sign up there to get an email notification as this article comes out each morning.<br /><br />You can read today&#39;s AWS here &gt;&gt;&gt;<strong>Pre-Market for New Trading Week in the Green</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Today&#39;s Featured Research Reports</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Home Depot&rsquo;s</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry over the past six months (+14.1% vs. +11.2%). The company&rsquo;s stocks prices were driven by a recovery in top-line trends supported by sales from the SRS acquisition. Home Depot delivered better-than-expected sales and EPS in third-quarter fiscal 2024, with year-over-year sales growth fueled by gains in certain seasonal categories due to favorable weather and hurricane-related demand.<br /><br />Home Depot gains from its &ldquo;One Home Depot&rdquo; investment plan focused on expanding supply chain facilities, enhancing technology, and improving the digital experience.<br /><br />HD is also advancing efforts to build a robust Pro ecosystem. HD raised its sales and EPS view for fiscal 2024, citing strong third-quarter results and projected hurricane-related demand in Q4. However, comparable sales and EPS remain impacted by higher interest rates and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Home Depot here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br />Shares of <strong>Booking</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past six months (+36.8% vs. +27.5%). The company is benefiting from a favorable travel demand environment, owing to the growing demand for global leisure travel demand. Substantial improvement in its booking trends remains a major tailwind.<br /><br />Solid momentum in booked room nights is contributing well to the gross bookings growth. Strong growth in rental car and airline ticket units is a major positive. Also, strong momentum across the merchant, and advertising and other businesses are other positives. The growing alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are tailwinds for the company.<br /><br />However, the declining trend in agency bookings is negatively affecting its top-line growth. Also, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East region remained concerning for the company.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Booking here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br /><strong>Eaton&rsquo;s</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. -2.6%). The company&rsquo;s fourth-quarter earnings were better than expected. Research and development work allows the company to develop new products and cater to a wider customer base.<br /><br />Eaton is aided by rising demand from the new AI-data center and contributions from its organic assets. It has been expanding via acquisitions and organic initiatives. Reindustrialization and megatrends will create more opportunities for Eaton. Our model expects total revenues to improve year over year in the 2025-2027 period.<br /><br />However, Eaton&rsquo;s global operations expose it to unpredictable currency translation, cyber security threats, changes in tax rates and security breaches, which might impact operations. The shortage of raw materials and supplier insolvencies might impact production and operations<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Eaton here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br />Shares of <strong>Value Line</strong> have underperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past year (-17.9% vs. +28.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $323.59 million have seen drop in reputation drives demand for diversified offerings, though publishing revenues by 8.8%, signaling weaker demand. Unearned revenues fell 5.4% from April 2024, hinting at future sales challenges. Reliance on a major customer (29.2% of publishing revenue) poses a concentration risk. Cash flow declined to $4.8 million, limiting financial flexibility.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Value Line offers strong shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, increasing its dividend for 10 consecutive years, with a $1.20 annualized payout. The company repurchased shares worth $0.2 million in the latest quarter, with $1.03 million still authorized, enhancing EPS.<br /><br />Cost management has been effective, cutting salaries to $3.5 million and preserving margins despite revenue pressures. Contributions from EULAV Asset Management rose to $4.2 million, providing steady cash flow. The $70.9 million investment portfolio offers liquidity.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Value Line here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+48.4%, +50.2%</strong> and <strong>+56.7%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">support@zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 19, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Walmart WMT, Home Depot HD, TJX Cos. TJX and Target TGT.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Here are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>U.S. Big-Box Retailers Report Earnings: Global Week Ahead</em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">What can happen in this Global Week Ahead?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For traders, it&#39;s a case of which way to look next.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With their screens flooded by headlines, from tariffs, and shaky Middle East ceasefire deals, to Russia and Ukraine.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There&#39;s also:</p><p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A G20 meeting</p><p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asia-Pacific central bank meetings, and</p><p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: justify;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WalMart earnings in the mix</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Next are Reuters&rsquo; five world market themes, re-ordered for equity traders&mdash;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(1) Before Markets Open (BMO) on Thursday, Feb. 20th Walmart Reports</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Walmart&#39;s </strong>quarterly report on Thursday should shed light on the health of the U.S. consumer as Wall Street frets about strong inflation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The retailing giant&#39;s results could highlight the impact of inflation on shopping behavior and offer early insight into the potential fallout of President Trump&#39; tariffs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consumer sentiment dropped in February to a seven-month low, a recent survey showed, while inflation expectations rocketed.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 1-1/2 years in January, latest data shows.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">No wonder U.S. rate cut bets are being dialed back.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Other U.S. retailers reporting in coming weeks, include<strong>Home Depot</strong>, <strong>TJX Cos.</strong> and <strong>Target</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, S&amp;P500 companies are set to have increased Q4-24 earnings by +15.1% from a year earlier, against expectations of a +9.6% increase as of Jan 1st, according to LSEG IBES.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(2) The Price of Gold Is Rising&hellip; and Rising</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">There seems to be little stopping gold&#39;s surge.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A classic &quot;inverse&quot; relationship with the U.S. dollar, where the gold price drops when the U.S. currency strengthens, appears to be over.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It&#39;s not just a matter of speculators deciding that gold is the next new thing. Much of the demand stems from concern that Trump&#39;s &quot;America First&quot; policies could upend global trade, financial flows and geopolitics.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Those themes might be apparent at the Feb 20th-21st G20 meeting, a gathering U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will miss.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Central banks are buying gold, partly to diversify reserves to include fewer dollars.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bullion traders are funneling gold into New York vaults to minimize the risk of Trump slapping tariffs on precious metals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Gold has roared to around $3,000 &mdash; up over +10% since Trump&#39;s election win. Next stop: $4,000?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(3) Will There Be War or Peace in Ukraine and Israel?</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The fate of two of the world&#39;s worst conflicts are suddenly extremely live, thanks to Donald Trump&#39;s interventions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Saturday could be make-or-break for the fragile 43-day-old ceasefire between Israel and Hamas &mdash; a deal both sides accuse the other of violating, and rocked by Trump&#39;s shock plan to clear out Gaza for a &quot;Riviera of the Middle East.&rdquo;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The all-crucial truce depends on whether Hamas releases the next group of Israeli hostages on schedule and Jerusalem &mdash; and Trump &mdash; are satisfied.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Then there&#39;s the Ukraine-Russia war. Trump has been busy there too, laying the groundwork for its likely endgame in lengthy talks with Russia&#39;s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine&#39;s Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Europe&#39;s markets have rallied on peace hopes. As the third anniversary of Russia&#39;s invasion nears, Moscow now controls a fifth of Ukraine.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(4) On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Refreshes Policy. CBs in New Zealand and Indonesia Reset Policy This Week, too.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">It&#39;s a central bank-packed week in Asia-Pacific with rate decisions in Australia, New Zealand, and Indonesia.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Reserve Bank of Australia is widely tipped to cut rates on Tuesday, though economists still expect some hawkishness given the strength in the labor market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is tipped to ease by half a percentage point, after lowering rates by a whopping 125 basis points already. The question now is how low the RBNZ can go given the gloomy economic reality?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over in Indonesia, it&#39;s trickier. After a surprise rate cut last month, economists expect Bank Indonesia to remain on hold, even as recent inflation and growth data underscore the case for more easing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A weakening rupiah is keeping its hands tied.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(5) Latest U.K. Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) Data Lands</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Bank of England may soon be back to writing public letters explaining why it is missing its inflation target, just days after cutting rates to 4.5%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some economists think data on Wednesday will show inflation rose as high as +3.2% in January from +2.5% in December, taking it more than a percentage point above its +2% target and requiring Governor Andrew Bailey to write a letter of explanation to finance minister Rachel Reeves after March&#39;s rate meeting.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The BoE estimates inflation was only +2.8% in January, but is on track to hit +3.7% by Q3 due to one-off factors that could push up regulated energy prices, water bills, bus fares and private-school fees.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tuesday&#39;s Q4 labor market data is also in focus. BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill described recent 6% private-sector pay growth as &ldquo;a little bit aberrant&rdquo; and said companies&#39; forecasts of +3.7% wage rises for 2025 were still too high for comfort.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year.

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 19, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: SoundHound AI, Inc. SOUN, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Nebius Group N.V. NBIS, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Here are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>SoundHound AI Stock Selloff Explained &ndash; Buy More SOUN Shares? </em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Courtesy of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, <strong>SoundHound AI, Inc</strong>. stock has soared over 380% in the past year. However, its upward journey abruptly stopped, leaving investors concerned about SoundHound AI&rsquo;s prospects. Are investors panicking needlessly, or is the stock a risky but potentially rewarding investment? Let&rsquo;s explore &ndash;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA Dumps SoundHound AI, More Challenges Ahead</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">SoundHound AI stock slumped 28.1% on Friday after <strong>NVIDIA Corp.</strong>&rsquo;s latest 13-F form revealed no stake in SOUN stock for the December quarter. According to the Dow Jones Market Data, this marks one of the worst performances for the SOUN stock, second only to the 48.4% one-day decline on June 6, 2022.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of the September 13-F form, NVIDIA held 1.7 million shares of SoundHound AI, valued at $8 million. However, NVIDIA&rsquo;s sale of its entire stake raised doubts about SoundHound AI&rsquo;s future growth trajectory, leading to strong market selling.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA is looking to diversify its AI portfolio, possibly shifting its stake from voice recognition technology to cloud computing and AI infrastructure. The semiconductor giant made new investments in Chinese self-driving tech firm WeRide and <strong>Nebius Group N.V.</strong>, an AI cloud computing company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, SoundHound AI&rsquo;s lofty valuations, resource constraints, losses from heavy investments, and reliance only on equity financing may hamper future growth. <strong>Alphabet Inc.</strong> entering SoundHound AI&rsquo;s space might also lead to stiff competition. After all, several cars, including Mercedes-Benz CLA vehicles, use Alphabet&rsquo;s conversational AI platform.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How to Trade SOUN Stock Now?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite setbacks like NVIDIA&rsquo;s exit, the SoundHound AI stock has the wherewithal to be a long-term winner in the AI race. The loss of NVIDIA, undoubtedly, has injected short-term volatility in SOUN stock, but the company still has strong revenue growth prospects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SoundHound AI&rsquo;s management estimated revenues to be $85 million for 2024 and $175 million for the current year, up from an earlier forecast of $80 million for 2024 and $150 million for 2025. The revenue growth projections remain impressive because of the widespread adoption of SoundHound AI&rsquo;s products. Its voice-enabled AI systems are in demand among electric vehicle manufacturers and quick-service restaurants like <strong>Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the time being, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged in its latest policy meeting; this won&rsquo;t affect SoundHound AI&rsquo;s cash flows. Moreover, NVIDIA&rsquo;s stake in SoundHound AI was minuscule, and won&rsquo;t have a material impact on the voice AI platform provider&rsquo;s business.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, risk-tolerant investors who believe in SoundHound AI&rsquo;s long-term potential should treat Friday&rsquo;s selloff as a buying opportunity. Some cautious investors may wait to see how SoundHound AI&rsquo;s outlook unfolds. (read more: Is Under $20 SoundHound AI Stock the Next NVIDIA, and a Buy?).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SoundHound AI has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+48.4%, +50.2%</strong> and <strong>+56.7%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">support@zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 19, 2025 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Here are highlights from Tuesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>What&rsquo;s Behind Meta&rsquo;s Record Rally? Should We Stay Invested? </em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Meta Platforms, Inc. </strong>is a well-known social media company with top apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta&rsquo;s shares surged this year mainly due to its focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Now, let&rsquo;s determine if it&rsquo;s a good time to stay invested in Meta.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Meta Stock Rallies 20 Sessions Straight</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta stock hasn&rsquo;t finished in the red in any of the trading sessions in February. Instead, the magnificent 7-stock notched 20 successive days of gains on Friday. Meta had only five losing sessions this year and has never had a losing session since Donald Trump became the 47th U.S. President.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So far this year, Meta has been the best performer among the magnificent seven stocks, up 25.8%. Meta stock soared to a record high of $736.67 on Friday, a 600% increase from its fall 2022 low when the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to tame 40-year high inflation.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Meta to Pour Billions into AI</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta&rsquo;s clear intention to make a mark in the high-growth potential AI market has bolstered investors&rsquo; sentiment and relentlessly helped its stock price scale upward. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently stated that the company intends to spend $60 billion to $65 billion in AI infrastructure and strengthen its position amongst rivals like <strong>Microsoft Corp.</strong>, its partner OpenAI and <strong>Alphabet Inc.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta plans to invest in AI-powered humanoid robots for physical tasks, while Zuckerberg expects Llama 4 to be the most widely used advanced large language model (LLM) this year. The company&rsquo;s highly personalized AI assistant, Meta AI, is set to assist 1 billion users this year, and a new 2-gigawatt data center in Louisiana is in the works.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta is one of the primary buyers of <strong>NVIDIA Corp.</strong>&rsquo;s chips and aims to have 1.3 million graphics processing units by the end of the year. Meta is intensifying its AI development by replacing underperforming employees and recruiting new talent to lead the AI competition.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Consider Keeping Meta Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta&rsquo;s AI initiatives, particularly with Llama 4, hold potential for long-term growth due to its agentic capabilities in addressing complex issues for users. Secondly, the company&rsquo;s AI engineering agent can compete with a mid-level engineer, a ground-breaking innovation that can bolster the stock price. Finally, Meta has over 3.3 billion loyal worldwide users across its apps, surpassing rivals and offering the company a wide moat. This gives Meta a strong position for future stock outperformance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Brokers also assume that the Meta stock will jump, raising the average short-term price target to $743.55 from the last closing price of $736.67 and setting the highest target at $935, an upside of 26.9%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors, thus, should continue holding Meta stock for its growth potential and consistent dividend payouts. Meta has a dividend yield of 0.27%. META&rsquo;s payout ratio presently sits at 8% of earnings. Check Meta Platforms&rsquo; dividend history here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+48.4%, +50.2%</strong> and <strong>+56.7%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">support@zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

<![CDATA[ Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights BYD, Geely Auto and XPeng ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 19, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses BYD Co Ltd BYDDY, Geely Auto GELYY and XPeng Inc. XPEV.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Industry: Foreign Autos</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417273/3-foreign-auto-stocks-standing-tall-amid-industry-weakness</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Automotive &ndash; Foreign industry presents a mixed outlook, shaped by key market trends. In China, the auto market remains resilient, with production and sales hitting record highs, driven by strong demand for new-energy vehicles (NEVs). Europe, however, is on a bumpy road, with sluggish battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales and ongoing economic pressure dampening growth. Meanwhile, Japan&rsquo;s market is on a recovery path after a weak 2024, though EV sales have struggled. Given the industry dynamics, a few stocks like <strong>BYD Co Ltd</strong>, <strong>Geely Auto</strong> and <strong>XPeng Inc. </strong>make for smart investment choices now.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Overview</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Companies in the Zacks Automotive &ndash; Foreign industry are involved in designing, manufacturing and selling vehicles, components as well as production systems. The foreign automotive industry is highly dependent on business cycles and economic conditions. China, Japan, Germany and India are some of the key foreign automotive manufacturing countries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The widespread usage of technology is resulting in the fundamental restructuring of the market. Stricter emission and fuel-economy targets and ramp-up of charging infrastructure, as well as supportive government policies, are boosting sales of green vehicles. With almost all firms intensifying their electrification game, competition is getting tougher with each passing day. Foreign automakers are now actively engaged in the R&amp;D of electric and autonomous vehicles, fuel efficiency and low-emission technologies.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Key Themes Shaping the Industry</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>China Auto Market to Stay Resilient</em></strong>: In 2024, China&#39;s auto production and sales reached record highs, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). The country produced 31.28 million vehicles and sold 31.44 million, marking year-on-year increases of 3.7% and 4.5%, respectively. This was the second straight year in which sales exceeded 30 million units.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">China has led global auto production and sales for 16 consecutive years. New-energy vehicle production and sales also set new records, surpassing 12 million units for the 10th consecutive year. NEV output reached 12.89 million, while sales hit 12.87 million, up 34.4% and 35.5%, respectively. NEVs accounted for 40.9% of total new car sales, an increase of 9.3 percentage points from 2023. CAAM projects total auto sales to reach 32.9 million units in 2025, a 4.7% increase, with NEV sales expected to hit 16 million, up 24.4%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Europe Auto Market on a Bumpy Road</em></strong>: In 2024, new car registrations in the European Union (EU) edged up 0.8% to around 10.6 million units. However, sales of BEVs and plug-in hybrids dropped 6% and 7%, respectively, as governments scaled back subsidies, putting pressure on the electric vehicle (EV) market. The European auto industry faces a tough road ahead, with challenges like EU tariffs on Chinese EV imports, potential U.S. tariffs under Trump, cautious consumers, economic slowdown, tapering subsidies on zero-emission vehicles and shifting emissions regulations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, stricter emissions laws and rising costs could continue to squeeze automakers&#39; profit margins. Meanwhile, high inflation and interest rates are further straining profits, leaving companies with fewer resources to invest in research and development, particularly in electrification.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cautious Optimism Amid Challenges in Japan</strong>: In 2024, new car sales in Japan fell 7.5% year on year to 4.42 million units, largely due to Daihatsu&rsquo;s suspension of shipments over emissions irregularities, according to data from the Japan Automobile Dealers Association and Japan Light Motor Vehicle and Motorcycle Association. S&amp;P Global Mobility expects Japan&rsquo;s light vehicle market to recover after a weak 2024, projecting sales to reach 4.6 million units in 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Having said that, risks remain, including potential U.S. tariffs and weaker global economic conditions, which could hurt Japan&rsquo;s auto exports, particularly to North America. Japan&rsquo;s EV sales dropped 33% in 2024, marking their first decline in four years. EVs now account for less than 2% of total new car sales. While Japanese automakers were early leaders in hybrid technology, their slow response to the EV boom is proving costly as they struggle to compete in the rapidly evolving global market.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Industry Rank is Not Promising</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Automotive &ndash; Foreign industry within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #154, which places it in the bottom 38% of around 250 Zacks industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry&rsquo;s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Over the past year, the industry&rsquo;s earnings estimates for 2025 have moved 30.2% south.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before we present a few stocks that are still worth adding to your portfolio, let&rsquo;s look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock market performance and current valuation.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Lags Sector and S&amp;P 500</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Automotive &ndash; Foreign industry has underperformed the Auto, Tires and Truck sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year. The industry has lost 23.7% against the S&amp;P 500 and the sector&rsquo;s growth of roughly 23% and 11%, respectively.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry&#39;s Current Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 8.93X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 17.67X and the sector&rsquo;s 19.85X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 12.59X, as low as 5.65X and at a median of 9X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3 Stocks to Buy</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Geely</strong>: One of the leading automakers in China, GELYY follows a &quot;multi-energy&quot; strategy, offering ICE, hybrid, electric and methanol vehicles. Last year, the company sold 2.17 million units, a 32% increase from the previous year. This year, it aims to sell 2.71 million units. Geely has expanded its presence to more than 80 countries, entering more than 10 new markets last year, including the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Popular models like the Coolray, Monjaro, Emgrand and Geely EX5 will drive Geely&rsquo;s growth. Its global sales and service network grew to about 900 locations, a 69% increase from 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To improve supply chains, Geely built a global parts network with a central hub and five overseas facilities. It also strengthened its presence in Oceania through a partnership with the Giltrap Group in New Zealand. New dealerships in Australia and New Zealand will boost sales. Geely also expanded into Indonesia by partnering with five major dealers. This move highlights its commitment to growth in Southeast Asia. With strong global expansion, Geely is set to achieve success.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GELYY currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has aVGM Score of A. The consensus mark for 2025 revenues and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 66.6% and 149%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings per share has been upwardly revised by 15 cents over the past 60 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BYD</strong>: This Chinese automaker is involved in vehicle manufacturing, secondary batteries and mobile components. Its vertically integrated model, spanning mining, batteries and chips, provides a competitive edge. BYD offers a wide range of vehicles. It sells budget-friendly models like the Seagull and Denza, as well as luxury cars under the Yangwang brand. Its Song and Qin hybrid and EV models are among China&#39;s bestsellers. The company continues to focus on affordability and efficiency with its DM 5.0 hybrid system and e-Platform 3.0.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2024, BYD set a record by selling over 4.27 million NEVs. Fully electric vehicle sales reached 1.76 million units, a 41% increase from the previous year. Its international growth is strong, with overseas NEV sales jumping 72% to more than 417,000 units.BYD is also advancing in autonomous driving. It introduced the &quot;God&#39;s Eye&quot; smart driving system recently, offering advanced driver assistance at a low cost. The company is also integrating AI from DeepSeek into its most advanced driver-assist system. BYD continues to push innovation in the global auto industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BYDDY currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. The consensus mark for 2025 revenues and EPS implies year-over-year growth of 21% and 27%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings per share has been upwardly revised by 14 cents over the past seven days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>XPeng</strong>: This Chinese EV maker delivered 190,068 vehicles in 2024, a 34% increase from the previous year. Its lineup includes the P7, P5, G6, G9, and X9 models. The company also launched the MONA-branded EV last year, a mass-market car priced under 200,000 yuan ($27,630), featuring Level 2 autonomous driving.XPeng is also expanding globally. It partnered with Volkswagen to build one of China&rsquo;s largest super-fast charging networks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In November 2024, it entered the UK market through a partnership with IML. By the end of 2024, XPeng was in 30 countries and regions. It plans to reach 60 by 2025. In the next decade, XPeng expects half of its sales to come from overseas.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">XPeng aims to achieve Level 4 autonomous driving in China by 2025. In November 2024, it introduced the XPENG Kunpeng Super Electric System, Turing AI Intelligent Driving System, and an AI Robot. At CES 2025, XPeng made headlines with its AeroHT Land Aircraft Carrier. This six-wheel EV concept serves as a launch pad for an electric aircraft, showcasing a futuristic vision for transportation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">XPEV currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. The consensus mark for 2025 top- and- bottom line implies year-over-year improvement of 91% and 73%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 loss per share has narrowed by 6 cents over the past seven days.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year.

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 19, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Interparfums, Inc. IPAR, Central Garden &amp; Pet Co. CENT, The RealReal, Inc. REAL and The Honest Company, Inc. HNST.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Industry: Consumer Discretionary</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417438/4-consumer-discretionary-stocks-poised-for-growth-in-2025</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Consumer Products-Discretionary industry remains dynamic, characterized by evolving consumer preferences, economic conditions and ongoing innovation. As inflationary pressures ease and labor markets remain resilient, consumer spending in discretionary categories is expected to stay robust.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, technological advancements, particularly in e-commerce and artificial intelligence, are enhancing consumer experiences and expanding market reach. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve&#39;s strategic approach to rate cuts should allow consumers to manage their budgets better and sustain discretionary purchases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While challenges persist, companies that leverage digital transformation, embrace sustainability and focus on delivering unique customer experiences are well-positioned to thrive in this burgeoning sector. <strong>Interparfums, Inc.</strong>, <strong>Central Garden &amp; Pet Co.</strong>, <strong>The RealReal, Inc.</strong> and <strong>The Honest Company, Inc.</strong> are well-placed to seize opportunities that may arise in this changed marketplace.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">About the Industry</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Consumer Products-Discretionary industry has a direct correlation with the economy, making it cyclical. Discretionary products command high prices, with middle-to-higher-income groups being targeted customers. The industry comprises companies that offer product categories, including fashion, jewelry and watches, and other home and art products.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quite a few players develop, manufacture, market and sell over-the-counter health and personal care products. Some even manufacture and distribute party goods. There are companies that design, source and distribute licensed pop culture products, too. Some industry participants also produce and distribute various products for the lawn and garden, and pet supplies markets. Companies sell products to specialty retailers, mass-market retailers and e-commerce sites.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">3 Key Trends to Watch in the Industry</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Consumers&rsquo; Willingness to Spend:</strong> The performance of the consumer discretionary industry is closely tied to consumers&rsquo; purchasing power. Despite a challenging economic environment, consumer spending &mdash; an essential driver of the economy &mdash; has shown resilience due to decent hiring and wage growth. In January, the U.S. economy added 143,000 jobs, contributing to this positive trend, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Average hourly earnings increased 4.1% compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate decreased to 4% from 4.1%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Brand Enhancement, Capital Discipline: </strong>Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. The launch of newer styles, customization options, unique packaging, point-of-sale displays, automation and high-end customer service enables them to woo consumers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Efforts to enhance the brand portfolio via marketing strategies, buyouts, innovations and alliances are likely to keep supporting players in the space. The companies have been taking steps to strengthen their financial position. They have been making every move, from managing the inventory to optimizing capital expenditures and enhancing operational efficiency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Margins, an Area to Watch:</strong> The industry is quite fragmented, with companies vying for a bigger slice of the pie on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. To address these, a significant number of players in the industry have been investing in strengthening their digital ecosystem.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While these endeavors provide an edge, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other operational expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Robust Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consumer Products-Discretionary industry is a group within the broader Consumer Discretionary sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #83, which places it in the top 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry&rsquo;s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of 2025, the industry&rsquo;s earnings estimate has risen roughly by 2%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let&rsquo;s take a look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Versus Broader Market</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consumer Products-Discretionary industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The industry has jumped 15.3% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s rise of 23.2%. Meanwhile, the broader sector has increased 18%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry&#39;s Current Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">On the basis of forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S), which is commonly used for valuing consumer discretionary stocks, the industry is currently trading at 3.26X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 5.37X and the sector&rsquo;s 2.26X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the last three years, the industry has traded as high as 3.38X and as low as 2.17X, with the median being at 2.74X.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">4 Stocks to Watch</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Central Garden &amp; Pet Company:</strong> The company is positioning itself as a frontrunner in the U.S. pet supplies and lawn and garden supplies industry, bolstering its competitive edge through a range of strategic endeavors. These include unique packaging, impactful point-of-sale displays, logistics capabilities and a steadfast commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. Central Garden &amp; Pet Company is focusing on brand building, containing costs, lowering complexity and improving margins. The company has been expanding its manufacturing capacity and simplifying its portfolio.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Central Garden &amp; Pet Company&rsquo;s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 1% and 8.4% from the year-ago period. CENT delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 208.7%, on average. Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have declined 9.9% in the past year. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Honest Company: </strong>The Honest Company&rsquo;s strong performance reflects its ability to drive sustainable growth through strategic initiatives. Robust consumer demand, supported by category strength and retail expansion, has positioned the company ahead of broader market trends. Margin expansion, fueled by supply-chain efficiencies and cost optimization, has enhanced profitability. Consistent gains in retail and e-commerce channels highlight growing brand recognition and customer loyalty. Moreover, disciplined marketing investments have strengthened consumer engagement, while a solid balance sheet with no debt provides the flexibility to reinvest in future growth opportunities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This manufacturer and seller of diapers and wipes, skin and personal care, and household and wellness products delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 80%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for The Honest Company&rsquo;s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 8.9% and 82.9% from the year-ago period. Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 company have surged 95.3% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The RealReal:</strong> REAL recently reported strong preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 while completing a strategic debt exchange to strengthen its financial position. The company, which operates as the largest online marketplace for authenticated resale luxury goods, announced that its Gross Merchandise Value (&ldquo;GMV&rdquo;) and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter exceeded the previous guidance. In the quarter, GMV reached $503.5 million, surpassing the prior guided range of $484 million-$500 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is expected between $10.7 million and $11.2 million, exceeding the prior range of $6.5 million-$9.5 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for REAL&rsquo;s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 9.1% and 12.6% from the year-ago period. REAL has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 30.3%, on average. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have advanced 339% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Interparfums:</strong> Interparfums&rsquo; growth strategy is driven by strong brand positioning, expanding market reach and disciplined execution. The company&rsquo;s diversified global presence reduces risk and enhances long-term stability while its premium brand portfolio continues to attract consumer demand. Effective distribution strategies, including direct-to-retail expansion and digital advancements, support sustained revenue momentum. Moreover, disciplined cost management and operational efficiencies reinforce profitability, allowing for reinvestment in brand-building initiatives.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This leading global fragrance company registered positive earnings surprises in the last two reported quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Interparfums&rsquo; current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 10.3% and 8.2% from the year-ago period. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 30.1% in the past year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+48.4%, +50.2%</strong> and <strong>+56.7%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Media Contact</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">support@zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 19, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses TriMas Corp. TRS and Northwest Pipe Co. NWPX.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Industry: Metal Fabrication</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417458/2-metal-fabrication-stocks-to-watch-despite-ongoing-industry-weakness</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry continues to face challenges due to prolonged contraction in manufacturing activity. Rising input costs, labor shortages and freight expenses further strain the profitability of the industry. The imposition of tariffs is anticipated to disrupt supply chains and drive costs even further.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Amid these conditions, industry players like <strong>TriMas Corp.</strong> and <strong>Northwest Pipe Co.</strong> are poised to benefit from their proactive cost-management actions and efforts to improve efficiency. Their continuous investments in automation, product innovation and acquisitions are anticipated to contribute to their growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">About the Industry</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry primarily comprises metal processing and fabrication service providers that transform metals into metal parts, machinery or components used across various other industries. Their processes include forging, stamping, bending, forming and machining, which are used in shaping individual pieces of metal, and welding and assembling to join parts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The companies either use one of these processes or a combination of all. The most common raw materials utilized by metal fabrication companies include plate metal, formed or expanded metal, tube stock, welding wire or rod and casting. The industry players serve an array of markets, including construction, mining, aerospace and defense, automotive, agriculture, oil and gas, electronics/electrical components, industrial equipment and general consumer.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Trends Shaping the Future of the Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication Industry</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Prolonged Contraction and Tariff Risks Cloud Metal Products Outlook</em></strong>: Per the Fed&rsquo;s latest industrial production report, the aggregate production of fabricated metal products in the United States was down 1.3% in the 12 months ended January 2025. The Institute for Supply Management&rsquo;s manufacturing index had been in contraction for 26 consecutive months until it saw a modest increase to 50.9% in January 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the fabricated metal products industry remained one of the eight industries still in contraction. The industry meanwhile reported growth in new orders in January. However, sustained growth remains uncertain. The imposition of tariffs by President Trump could disrupt supply chains and derail this recent recovery in U.S. manufacturing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>High Costs &amp; Tariff Concerns Ail the Industry</em></strong>: The industry has been experiencing significant inflation levels, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The companies are witnessing labor shortages for some positions and incurring steep labor costs to meet demand. The industry players are focusing on pricing actions, cost-cutting measures, efforts to improve productivity and efficiency, and the diversification of the supplier bases to mitigate some headwinds. Also, the imposition of tariffs is anticipated to lead to higher costs for the industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Automation &amp; End-Market Growth to Act as Catalysts</em></strong>: The industry&rsquo;s customer-focused approach to provide cost-effective technical solutions, automation to increase efficiency and lower labor costs, and the development of innovative products will drive growth in the days ahead. Improvements in end-use sectors, such as manufacturing, aerospace and automotive, are anticipated to benefit the metal fabrication market over the next few years. Developing countries hold promise due to rapid industrialization. This, in turn, is likely to create demand.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates tepid prospects in the near term. The Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry, a nine-stock group within the broader Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #221, which places it in the bottom 11% of the 252 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential. The industry&#39;s earnings estimates for 2025 have moved down 4% since the beginning of this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let us look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry vs. Broader Market</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry has outperformed its sector and Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over this period, the industry has grown 34.4% compared with the sector&rsquo;s increase of 6.4% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s rise of 23.3%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry&#39;s Current Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing the Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication companies, the industry is currently trading at 18.61 compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 13.96 and the Industrial Products sector&rsquo;s forward 12-month EV/EBITDA of 18.61.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 31.97 and as low as 4.20, with the median at 9.76.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">2 Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication Stocks to Keep Tabs on</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Northwest Pipe</strong>: The company recently received a U.S. Patent for the InfraShield Joint System, an innovative solution to strengthen the resilience of steel pipelines. It has been implementing cost-reduction techniques and actions to enhance operating efficiency, which will support margins. Rising demand for developed water sources and the pressing need to upgrade, repair and replace the aging U.S water and wastewater systems present significant opportunities for NWPX.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company continues strengthening its liquidity by repaying debt and generating strong cash flow from operations, supported by effective working capital management. Northwest Pipe&rsquo;s growth strategy has been focused on improving the Precast business to reduce the cyclicality of the Steel Pressure Pipe operations and increasing overall margins and cash flow. The company also continues to look for growth opportunities through expansion or acquisitions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vancouver, WA-based Northwest Pipe&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings has remained unchanged over the past 60 days. The estimate indicates growth of 5.1% from the year-earlier number. NWPX has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.5%, on average. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a long-term estimated earnings growth of 5%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TriMas</strong>: The company&rsquo;s packaging segment is benefiting from the gradual recovery in the consumer goods and industrial markets, and improving order intake. The Aerospace segment is poised for growth on solid backlog, order intake and operational excellence initiatives. The company recently closed the acquisition of Germany-based GMT Aerospace, a manufacturer of tie rods used in a range of structural aerospace applications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This move will add the first manufacturing location in Europe for the Aerospace segment. This is in sync with TriMas&rsquo; strategy to accelerate growth through acquisitions, particularly in its Packaging and Aerospace platforms. The company has a strong pipeline of products and process innovation, which will sustain long-term growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bloomfield Hills, MI-based TriMas&rsquo; fiscal 2025 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 20.7%. The estimate has moved up 2% over the past 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+48.4%, +50.2%</strong> and <strong>+56.7%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Media Contact</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">support@zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 19, 2025 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Nutrien Ltd. NTR, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. CF and ICL Group Ltd. ICL.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Industry: Fertilizer</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417242/3-top-fertilizer-stocks-to-watch-from-a-promising-industry</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Fertilizers industry is expected to benefit from favorable demand fundamentals for major crop nutrients, including phosphate and potash. The underlying strength of the agricultural market and attractive farm economics are spurring demand for fertilizers globally.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Industry players such as <strong>Nutrien Ltd.</strong>, <strong>CF Industries Holdings, Inc.</strong> and <strong>ICL Group Ltd. </strong>are poised to gain from higher demand for fertilizers in the major markets. While weak fertilizer prices pose headwinds, factors like healthy farm income and expectations of increased planted acres are expected to drive crop nutrient demand globally in the near term.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">About the Industry</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Fertilizers industry comprises producers, distributors and marketers of crop nutrients for the global agriculture industry. Companies in this space offer nutrients such as phosphates (including diammonium phosphate, monoammonium phosphate and phosphoric acid), potash and nitrogen (including urea, ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate) fertilizers. They also provide other nitrogen products to help farmers maximize crop yield.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Crop nutrients are essential to drive agricultural productivity and boost the natural fertility of the soil. Demand for these nutrients is being supported by the need to increase the production of grains to address rising food consumption globally. Moreover, the constant need of growers to nourish their crops, replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing global population drives the consumption of fertilizers.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&#39;s Shaping the Future of the Fertilizers Industry?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Healthy Demand for Crop Nutrients: </em></strong>The companies in the fertilizers space are well-placed to benefit from healthy global demand for major crop nutrients. In the United States, healthy farm profits and high levels of planted acreage are expected to drive demand for fertilizers. Strong farmer economics should support demand in major markets such as Brazil and India. The phosphate market is benefiting from higher global demand and low producer and channel inventories.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strong grower economics, improved affordability and low inventory levels are also expected to drive potash demand globally. Demand for nitrogen fertilizer remains healthy in major markets, backed by significant agricultural demand and recovering industrial demand. High levels of corn planted acres and low nitrogen channel inventories should drive demand for nitrogen in North America. Also, demand for urea imports in Brazil and India remains favorable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Agricultural Fundamentals Remain Favorable:</em></strong> Fundamentals in the broader agriculture space remain positive, given the sustained rise in food demand globally. While prices of corn, soybean and wheat have declined from the multi-year highs reached in 2022, they remain supportive. Farmer economics also remain attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s (USDA) latest outlook, net farm income is projected to climb 29.5% year over year to $180.1 billion this year, driven by a significant increase in government payments. USDA forecasts direct government payments at $42.4 billion in 2025, a 354.5% surge from 2024. Solid farm income is likely to drive farmers&rsquo; spending on crop nutrients this year. Expectations of high levels of planted corn and soybean acres globally also suggest a pickup in fertilizer demand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Softer Fertilizer Prices to Weigh on Margins: </em></strong>Prices of phosphate and potash have retreated since the back half of 2022 from their peak levels attained in the first half, riding on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war and disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus. Global nitrogen prices have also declined since the beginning of 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Higher global supply, driven by increased global operating rates due to lower global energy costs, has resulted in a decline in nitrogen prices. While fertilizer prices have stabilized somewhat, weaker year-over-year prices are likely to dent the profitability of companies in this space over the near term.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Upbeat Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Fertilizers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #39, which places it in the top 16% of more than 250 Zacks industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a bright near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let&rsquo;s take a look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Underperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Fertilizers industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector over the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The industry has lost 1.1% over this period against the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s rise of 23.3% and the broader sector&rsquo;s increase of 0.7%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry&#39;s Current Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing fertilizer stocks, the industry is currently trading at 10.98X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 17.67X and the sector&rsquo;s 11.51X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.88X and as low as 4.97X, with a median of 10.71X.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">3 Fertilizer Stocks to Keep a Close Eye On</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nutrien: </strong>Canada-based Nutrien is a leading provider of crop inputs and services. The company is benefiting from higher demand for crop nutrients on strength in the global agriculture markets. It is seeing strong demand in its major markets, particularly North America. NTR is also gaining from acquisitions, cost efficiency and increased adoption of its digital platform. The company also continues to expand its footprint in Brazil through acquisitions. Lower natural gas costs are also acting in NTR&rsquo;s favor.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nutrien currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). NTR has expected earnings growth of 5.9% for 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has been revised 1.6% upward over the past 60 days. It also has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 12%. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ICL Group: </strong>Israel-based ICL is engaged in the fertilizer and specialty chemical sectors. The company remains focused on growing its specialties businesses. Efforts to boost operating efficiency and productivity and the launch of new innovative solutions should support its results. The acquisition of Nitro 1000 also allows ICL to expand its market position and leadership in Brazil&#39;s specialty plant nutrition.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The buyout of Custom Ag Formulators also expanded its global Growing Solutions business. The new food specialty plant in China will also strengthen relationships with existing customers while exploring new business opportunities in the country. Moreover, ICL&#39;s investment in Plantible Foods demonstrates its commitment to developing sustainable and innovative food-sector solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ICL Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. It has expected earnings growth of 14.4% for 2025. ICL&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 18.1%, on average.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CF Industries: </strong>Illinois-based CF Industries is a leading global manufacturer of nitrogen and hydrogen products for fertilizer, clean energy, emissions reduction and other industrial applications. It is gaining from higher nitrogen fertilizer demand in the major markets. CF is seeing higher nitrogen demand for industrial uses in North America. Lower natural gas prices are also acting in the company&rsquo;s favor. CF remains committed to boosting shareholders&rsquo; value by leveraging strong cash flows.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CF Industries currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 10.3%, on average. CF also has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 37%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.7% average gain per year.

<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; February 19, 2025 &ndash; Stocks in this week&rsquo;s article are Accel Entertainment, Inc. ACEL, Frontdoor, Inc. FTDR, EverQuote, Inc. EVER and Roku, Inc. ROKU.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Add These 4 Top-Ranked Liquid Stocks to Boost Portfolio Returns</em></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The liquidity of a stock is an important parameter that investors should consider while adding stocks to their portfolios. Liquidity primarily determines a company&rsquo;s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors can consider adding four top-ranked stocks, such as <strong>Accel Entertainment, Inc.</strong>, <strong>Frontdoor, Inc.</strong>, <strong>EverQuote, Inc</strong>. and <strong>Roku, Inc.</strong> to their portfolios to boost returns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liquid stocks have always been in demand owing to their potential to provide maximum returns. However, one should be alert enough before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is clearing its dues faster than peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Current Ratio</strong>: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. The ratio gauges a company&rsquo;s potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio &mdash; the working capital ratio &mdash; below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. A high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also indicate that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Quick Ratio</strong>: Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio &mdash; the &ldquo;acid-test ratio&rdquo; or &ldquo;quick assets ratio&rdquo; &mdash; indicates a company&rsquo;s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. A quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable, like the current ratio.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cash Ratio</strong>: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company&rsquo;s ability to meet existing debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A ratio greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always represent a company&rsquo;s financial condition.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screen:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Accel Entertainment</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Accel Entertainment</strong> is a distributed gaming operator offering turnkey full-service gaming solutions to authorized non-casino locations such as truck stops, bars, restaurants, convenience stores and fraternal and veteran establishments, primarily in the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company recently acquired 85% of the ownership interests of Toucan Gaming, LLC and LSM Gaming, LLC for $40 million to expand its market footprint. Both are Louisiana-based route operators and owners of several licensed video poker establishments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the last reported quarter, ACEL reported revenues of $302.2 million, up 5.1% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA of $45.9 million rose 3.9% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at 90 cents per share, unchanged in past seven days. ACEL has a Growth Score of B and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.1%, on average.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Frontdoor</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Frontdoor </strong>is the parent company of home service plan brands like American Home Shield, HSA, Landmark and OneGuard. The company&#39;s customizable home service plans help customers protect and maintain their homes from costly and unplanned breakdowns of essential home systems and appliances.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">FTDR recently acquired 2-10 Home Buyers Warranty in an all-cash transaction for $585 million. This particular buyout diversifies Frontdoor&rsquo;s portfolio and client base. It will also increase cross-selling opportunities for FTDR&rsquo;s home warranties and on-demand services.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the last reported quarter, revenues came in at $540 million, up 3% year over year. The uptick was driven by a 4% increase in price, which was partly offset by a 1% decline from reduced volume. Further, the number of first-year Direct-to-Consumer home warranties was 271,000, up 3% sequentially. Gross margin expanded 550 basis points to 57% in the third quarter of 2024. The expansion was mainly driven by higher price and a shift to higher service fees.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It also concluded a $400 million share repurchase authorization in August 2024 and initiated a new three-year, $650 million buyback authorization in September 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $3.15 per share, unchanged in past seven days. FTDR has a Growth Score of B and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 269%, on average.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EverQuote</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EverQuote</strong>, headquartered in Cambridge, MA, is an online insurance marketplace. The company&#39;s websites allow consumers to shop for auto, home, renters and life insurance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">EverQuote is gaining from its exclusive data assets and technology, deepened focus on core P&amp;C markets and a robust financial profile. It is also focused on streamlining traffic operations, boosting AI-powered bidding solutions and rolling out advanced agent technology platforms, which positions it well for long-term growth. Recovery in automotive and other insurance verticals, given auto carrier recovery and growth in revenue per quote request, bodes well. In the last reported quarter, total revenues of $144.5 million increased 163% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EVER&rsquo;s 2024 earnings is pegged at 73 cents per share, unchanged in the past 30 days. The company has a Growth Score of A and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 149.6%, on average.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Roku</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Roku </strong>is the leading TV streaming platform provider in the United States. Roku&rsquo;s performance is being driven by increased user engagement on The Roku Channel and the popularity of the Roku TV program.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company recently reported fourth-quarter 2024 results. It incurred a loss of 24 cents per share in the quarter, which came in narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 44 cents. The company had incurred a loss of 55 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenues increased 22% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level to $1.2 billion and beat the consensus mark by 4.48%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Roku continued to expand penetration in the United States, surpassing half of broadband households. Globally, Roku ended 2024 with 89.8 million streaming households and surpassed 90 million in the first week of January 2025. Fourth-quarter 2024 net adds were 4.3 million and full-year 2024 net adds were 9.8 million. The average revenue per user increased 4% year over year to $41.49 (on a trailing 12-month basis).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2025, Roku expects total net revenues of $4.61 billion, total gross profit of $2.005 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $350 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 bottom line is pegged at a loss of 80 cents per share. The consensus mark improved from a loss of 91 cents seven days ago. The company has a Growth Score of A.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

<![CDATA[ Restaurant Earnings Roundup: MCD, CAKE, TXRH ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 01:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>The 2024 Q4 earnings cycle is beginning to lose a bit of steam, with a wide majority of S&amp;P 500 companies already delivering their quarterly results. The period has remained positive, underpinned by strong earnings growth and favorable commentary.</p><p>Among the bunch this week are several well-known restaurant operators, a list that includes Cheesecake Factory CAKE and Texas Roadhouse TXRH. But what should investors expect from the pair? Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at expectations and results from a restaurant peer, McDonald&rsquo;s MCD, to get a better feel.</p><p><strong>McDonald&rsquo;s</strong></p><p>Concerning headline figures in its release, MCD posted EPS that met our consensus estimate and reported sales modestly below expectations. EPS fell 4% year-over-year, whereas sales of $6.4 billion fell -0.3% year-over-year.</p><p>While the top and bottom line results weren&rsquo;t great, the real thorn in the side of MCD remains its same-store sales. U.S. comparable sales fell 2% year-over-year, likely reflective of consumers becoming wary about their spending habits given the menu&rsquo;s continued price increases over recent years.</p><p>Still, other regions have helped ease the U.S. drag, with global comparable sales overall increasing 0.4% year-over-year. As shown below, the results helped snap a streak of negative surprises on the metric, finally exceeding our consensus estimate.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/99/94396.jpg?v=844261820" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong>Cheesecake Factory</strong></p><p>Analysts have shown a sliver of positivity for CAKE&rsquo;s upcoming print, with the $0.92 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up marginally over the last several months and suggesting 15% growth year-over-year. The consensus sales estimate has remained unchanged over recent months, with the company expected to see 4% sales growth year-over-year.</p><p>Similar to MCD, comparable restaurant sales will be a key metric to watch in the release, which have regularly exceeded our consensus expectations as of late. Comparable restaurant sales increased 1.4% year-over-year throughout its latest period, undoubtedly a positive development.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d5/94397.jpg?v=852747003" /></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>David Everton, CEO, delivered positivity following the latest print, stating, <em>&ldquo;We are capturing market share as evidenced by the continued strong outperformance in comparable sales and traffic at The Cheesecake Factory restaurants versus the broader casual dining industry. Execution within our restaurants was exceptional with our operators delivering significant improvements in labor productivity, hourly staff and manager retention, and guest satisfaction scores.&rdquo;</em></p><p><strong>Texas Roadhouse</strong></p><p>Analysts have remained silent for TXRH&rsquo;s upcoming release, with top and bottom line revisions remaining stagnant over recent months. Big growth is expected, with current estimates alluding to 53% EPS growth on 21% higher sales.</p><p>The company&rsquo;s top line has shown consistently strong growth over the past five years, as shown below.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/41/94398.jpg?v=708339253" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>In addition, TXRH&rsquo;s latest set of quarterly results were filled with positivity, with the company seeing 8.5% comparable sales growth year-over-year. Expansion has also aided the company nicely, with Texas Roadhouse expecting to grow its footprint even further throughout 2025.</p><p>Analysts have taken note of its momentum, raising its current year outlook bullishly and helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/79/94399.jpg?v=766927710" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong>Wrapping Up </strong></p><p>We&rsquo;ve got several well-known restaurant operators on the reporting docket this week, a list that includes Cheesecake Factory CAKE and Texas Roadhouse TXRH.</p><p>A peer, McDonald&rsquo;s MCD, has already revealed its quarterly results, with U.S. comparable sales remaining weak. Global comparable sales did take a small step higher relative to the prior period, but U.S. consumers have seemingly shifted preferences following menu price increases.</p><p>Comparable store sales will be key for both CAKE and TXRH, essentially telling us whether their established locations are still seeing growth. Both CAKE and TXRH posted favorable results concerning the metric in their latest releases, with TXRH&rsquo;s momentum much clearer.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417641/restaurant-earnings-roundup-mcd-cake-txrh?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-stocks_in_the_news-2417641">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Buy Walmart Stock for Steady Growth as Q4 Earnings Approach? ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Walmart WMT&nbsp;will give insight into the current state of consumer shopping behavior, with the omnichannel retailer set to release its Q4 results on Thursday, February 20.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Broadly speaking, inflationary pressures have started to ease following several rate cuts in 2024, but Walmart has kept a competitive advantage over Target TGT</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">, which tends to offer premium goods at a higher cost. Furthermore, Walmart&rsquo;s online expansion has put the company in a better position to compete with e-commerce titan Amazon AMZN</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Walmart&rsquo;s Q4 Expectations </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Year over year, Walmart&rsquo;s Q4 sales are thought to have increased 3% to $179.18 billion. On the bottom line, Q4 EPS is expected to be up 6% to $0.64. More intriguing, The Zacks ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) indicates Walmart could surpass earnings expectations with the most up-to-date analyst revisions (Most Accurate Estimate)&nbsp; having Q4 EPS pegged at $0.66 and 2% above the Zacks Consensus.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fe/94386.jpg?v=751183879" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Notably, Walmart has reached or exceeded earnings expectations for 10 consecutive quarters with an average EPS surprise of 9.25% in its last four quarterly reports.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/72/94387.jpg?v=484778430" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Tracking Walmart&rsquo;s Outlook </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Wrapping up its current fiscal year 2025, Walmart&rsquo;s total sales are slated to increase 5% to $678.56 billion versus $648.13 billion in FY24. Based on Zacks estimates, Walmart&rsquo;s top line is projected to expand another 4% in FY26 to $704.61 billion.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Even better, Walmart&rsquo;s annual earnings are slotted to rise 12% to $2.48 per share, from EPS of $2.22 in FY24. Plus, Zacks projections call for Walmart&rsquo;s EPS to expand another 11% in FY26 to $2.74.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/72/94388.jpg?v=936687910" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>WMT Performance &amp; Valuation </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Pounding the question of whether it&rsquo;s time to buy WMT for more upside, Walmart&rsquo;s stock has already risen over +70% since its 3-1 stock split last February. Over the last year, WMT has impressively outperformed the broader market and Amazon&rsquo;s +33%, with Target shares down a dismal -13%.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b9/94393.jpg?v=1757184572" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Trading around $103, Walmart stock is at a 37.9X forward earnings multiple, a noticeable premium to the benchmark S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 23X. WMT also trades well above Target&rsquo;s 13.7X but is near Amazon&rsquo;s 36.2X.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/64/94394.jpg?v=526423872" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Takeaway </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Ahead of its Q4 report, Walmart&rsquo;s stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). To that point, Walmart&rsquo;s EPS growth has started to justify its price-to-earnings premium to the broader market, especially with the Zacks ESP suggesting the company could exceed Q4 bottom line expectations.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417606/buy-walmart-stock-for-steady-growth-as-q4-earnings-approach?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-investment_ideas-2417606">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Tuesday, February 18, 2025</strong><br /><br />Market indexes closed today&rsquo;s regular trading session on a strong upswing that brought levels back near morning highs. That said, we lost the exuberance today&rsquo;s pre-market trading had been enjoying. The Dow closed +10 points as of the closing bell, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both at +14. The small-cap Russell 2000 is the only index higher than where we saw it ahead of the open: +10 points.<br /><br /><h2>Homebuilder Confidence Drops Off<br /></h2><br />February results from the latest <strong>NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index </strong>were a bit of a disappointment earlier today, coming in at 42 versus an expected print of 46 &mdash; both down from the unrevised 47 the previous month, which happens to be the highest level since April of last year. Today&rsquo;s 42 is the lowest result from this survey since September.<br /><br />Policy uncertainties and cost factors remain current headwinds. This should not be surprising to anyone following the current housing market, with its 7% mortgage rates and low volumes.<br /><br />Tomorrow morning, January <strong>Housing Starts and Building Permits</strong> will add further articulation to the housing story of early 2025. Both are expected to have ticked down from the previous month &mdash; to 1.4 million from 1.5 million on the Starts side, and 1.46 million versus 1.48 million on Permits. The 1.8 million levels we were seeing on both Starts and Permits three years ago are clearly a thing of the past.<br /><br /><h2>Toll Brothers Misses Expectations, Cadence Beats but Falls<br /></h2><br />High-end homebuilder<strong> Toll Brothers </strong>TOL came up short on both top and bottom lines in its fiscal Q1 report this afternoon. Earnings of $1.75 per share were well off the expected pace of $1.99 (and well behind the $2.25 per share reported in the year-ago quarter), while revenues of $1.89 billion was off by a smidge. A total of 1991 homes were delivered, missing the 2060 expected. Weaknesses were reportedly due to impairments and a transactional delay. The average price of a Toll Brothers home was $925K in the quarter.<br /><strong><br />Check out the updated Zacks Earnings Calendar here.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Cadence Design Systems</strong> CDNS typically outpaced expectations on its bottom line for Q4 after today&rsquo;s close. Earnings of $1.88 per share surpassed the Zacks consensus by 6 cents, while $1.35 billion in revenues was exactly in-line with estimates. Again, however, guidance was weaker than analysts were looking for, and shares are down -5% in late trading.

<![CDATA[ <p>The Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF VOO has dethroned State Street&#39;s SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF SPY as the largest ETF in the world. VOO now boasts approximately $632 billion in assets, according to Bloomberg data, surpassing SPY&rsquo;s $630 billion.</p><p>SPY, the first U.S.-listed ETF, held the crown as the largest ETF for over three decades. It remains the most traded and most liquid ETF globally, favored by professional traders for its immense liquidity and ultra-tight spreads.</p><p>However, with an expense ratio of 0.0945%, SPY is the most expensive of the ETFs tracking the S&amp;P 500 index. In contrast, VOO and BlackRock&rsquo;s iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF IVV charge an expense ratio of 0.03%, while the SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 ETF SPLG is even cheaper, with a fee of just 0.02%.</p><p>Rock-bottom fees have been instrumental in attracting cost-conscious retail investors and advisors to VOO, IVV, and SPLG. VOO broke the record for annual inflows last year, gaining $116 billion, and continues to attract billions in assets this year.</p><p>All these ETFs have benefited from the exceptional performance of U.S. large-cap stocks, particularly NVIDIA NVDA, which accounts for about 7% of VOO&rsquo;s portfolio. Over the past two years, the S&amp;P 500 has posted annual gains exceeding 20%, driving massive inflows into these funds.</p><h2>The Vanguard Effect</h2><p>Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, the creator of the first index fund for individual investors, established the firm&#39;s unique ownership structure, which passes along profits to reduce investment costs for clients.</p><p>Unlike other fund management companies, which are owned by public or private stockholders, Vanguard&rsquo;s investors are also its owners.</p><p>Earlier this month, Vanguard announced its largest-ever fee reduction, expected to save investors more than $350 million this year alone. The firm lowered expense ratios on 168 share classes across 87 funds.</p><p>Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence and author of &ldquo;The Bogle Effect: How John Bogle and Vanguard Turned Wall Street Inside Out and Saved Investors Trillions,&rdquo; told me on my podcast that VOO could remain the ETF king for a very long time.</p><p>ETFs to Watch in 2025: Bitcoin, Cheap Beta, AI, &amp; More</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417573/etf-investors-crown-a-new-king?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2417573">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Tuesday, February 18, 2025</strong><br /><br />The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today&#39;s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Home Depot, Inc. (HD), Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) and Eaton Corp. plc (ETN), as well as a micro-cap stock Value Line, Inc. (VALU). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.<br /><br />These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.<br /><br />You can <strong>see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong><br /><br /><u><strong>Ahead of Wall Street</strong></u><br /><br />The daily &#39;Ahead of Wall Street&#39; article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day&#39;s trading action.

The company&rsquo;s stocks prices were driven by a recovery in top-line trends supported by sales from the SRS acquisition. Home Depot delivered better-than-expected sales and EPS in third-quarter fiscal 2024, with year-over-year sales growth fueled by gains in certain seasonal categories due to favorable weather and hurricane-related demand.<br /><br />Home Depot gains from its &ldquo;One Home Depot&rdquo; investment plan focused on expanding supply chain facilities, enhancing technology, and improving the digital experience.<br /><br />HD is also advancing efforts to build a robust Pro ecosystem. HD raised its sales and EPS view for fiscal 2024, citing strong third-quarter results and projected hurricane-related demand in Q4. However, comparable sales and EPS remain impacted by higher interest rates and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Home Depot here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br />Shares of <strong>Booking</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past six months (+36.8% vs. +27.5%). The company is benefiting from a favorable travel demand environment, owing to the growing demand for global leisure travel demand. Substantial improvement in its booking trends remains a major tailwind.<br /><br />Solid momentum in booked room nights is contributing well to the gross bookings growth. Strong growth in rental car and airline ticket units is a major positive. Also, strong momentum across the merchant, and advertising and other businesses are other positives. The growing alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are tailwinds for the company.<br /><br />However, the declining trend in agency bookings is negatively affecting its top-line growth. Also, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East region remained concerning for the company.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Booking here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br /><strong>Eaton&rsquo;s</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. -2.6%). The company&rsquo;s fourth-quarter earnings were better than expected. Research and development work allows the company to develop new products and cater to a wider customer base.<br /><br />Eaton is aided by rising demand from the new AI-data center and contributions from its organic assets. It has been expanding via acquisitions and organic initiatives. Reindustrialization and megatrends will create more opportunities for Eaton. Our model expects total revenues to improve year over year in the 2025-2027 period.<br /><br />However, Eaton&rsquo;s global operations expose it to unpredictable currency translation, cyber security threats, changes in tax rates and security breaches, which might impact operations. The shortage of raw materials and supplier insolvencies might impact production and operations<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Eaton here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br />Shares of <strong>Value Line</strong> have underperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry over the past year (-17.9% vs. +28.3%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $323.59 million have seen drop in reputation drives demand for diversified offerings, though publishing revenues by 8.8%, signaling weaker demand. Unearned revenues fell 5.4% from April 2024, hinting at future sales challenges. Reliance on a major customer (29.2% of publishing revenue) poses a concentration risk. Cash flow declined to $4.8 million, limiting financial flexibility.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Value Line offers strong shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, increasing its dividend for 10 consecutive years, with a $1.20 annualized payout. The company repurchased shares worth $0.2 million in the latest quarter, with $1.03 million still authorized, enhancing EPS.<br /><br />Cost management has been effective, cutting salaries to $3.5 million and preserving margins despite revenue pressures. Contributions from EULAV Asset Management rose to $4.2 million, providing steady cash flow. The $70.9 million investment portfolio offers liquidity.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Value Line here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br />Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), The Williams Companies, Inc. (WMB) and Roku, Inc. (ROKU).<br /><br />Mark Vickery<br />Sernior Editor<br /><br /><em>Note: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As we progress through February, investors may notice that Roku ROKU</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;and Twilio TWLO</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;have been two of the hottest stocks so far this year.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Year to date, ROKU has soared over +30%, with TWLO up +14%. That said, let&rsquo;s see if it&rsquo;s still time to buy Roku or Twilio stock after releasing their Q4 results last Thursday.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/e1/94381.jpg?v=1608987274" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Roku&rsquo;s Q4 Review &nbsp;</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As the leading TV streaming platform provider in North America, Roku&rsquo;s Q4 sales increased 22% year over year to $1.2 billion versus $984.43 million in the prior year quarter. Surpassing Q4 sales estimates of $1.14 billion, Roku has exceeded top-line expectations for 10 consecutive quarters.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">More importantly, Roku posted a much narrower-than-expected loss of -$0.24 a share, with the Zacks EPS Consensus calling for an adjusted loss of -$0.44. This was also a sharp increase from an adjusted loss of -$0.55 a share in Q4 2023. Roku has beaten earnings expectations for five straight quarters, with the company edging closer to profitability after going public in 2017.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1e/94382.jpg?v=1395678873" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Twilio&rsquo;s Q4 Review </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Allowing developers to operate real-time communications within software applications, Twilio&rsquo;s Q4 sales were up 11% YoY to $1.19 billion compared to $1.07 billion in the comparative quarter. Slightly edging Q4 sales estimates, Twilio has beaten its top-line expectations in every quarter since the company went public in 2016.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">However, Q4 EPS of $1.00 did miss expectations of $1.02 despite spiking 16% from $0.86 a share in the prior period. Still, Twilio has exceeded earnings expectations in three of its last four quarterly reports with an average EPS surprise of 17.79%.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6b/94383.jpg?v=100110609" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Roku &amp; Twilio&rsquo;s Full-Year Results </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Rounding out fiscal 2024, Roku&rsquo;s total sales spiked 18% to $4.11 billion from $3.48 billion in 2023. Annual earnings were at a loss of -$0.89 per share from -$5.02 in 2023.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Pivoting to Twilio, total sales rose 7% to $4.45 billion. Twilio&rsquo;s annual earnings soared 50% to $3.67 per share from EPS of $2.45 in 2023. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Tracking Roku &amp; Twilio&rsquo;s Outlook</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Offering revenue guidance for FY25, Roku expects its total sales to increase 12% this year to $4.61 billion. Based on Zacks estimates, Roku&rsquo;s sales are projected to expand another 13% in FY26 to $5.22 billion. Roku also expects its total gross profit to be $2 billion this year with adjusted EBITDA projected at $350 million.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Notably, Roku aims to achieve positive operating margins by 2026, with Zacks projections calling for EPS of $0.10 next year, and FY25 earnings currently projected at an adjusted loss of -$0.80. Reassuringly, FY25 and FY26 EPS estimates are nicely up in the last 30 days.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fb/94384.jpg?v=399933699" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">As for Twilio, it offered guidance for the first quarter, with Q1 sales expected at $1.13-$1.14 billion, which would reflect 8% to 9% growth. Twilio expects Q1 EPS in the range of $0.88-$0.93 from $0.80 a share in the comparative quarter. Twilio forecasts total sales to increase by 7%-8% in FY25, with the current Zacks Consensus at $4.78 billion or 7% growth. Zacks projections call for Twilio&rsquo;s sales to increase another 7% in FY26 to $5.13 billion.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For Q1, Twilio expects non-GAAP net income from operations to be $180 million-$190 million, with full-year expectations of $825 million-$850 million. These forecasts translate to the current Zacks Consensus calling for Twilio&rsquo;s EPS to expand 18% this year to $4.33. Even better, FY26 EPS is projected to rise another 14% to $4.94. While FY25 EPS estimates are slightly down in the last month, FY26 EPS estimates have risen 8%.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/27/94385.jpg?v=1094510569" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Bottom Line &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Roku and Twilio&rsquo;s expansion have remained compelling, with both stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment. Although their operating efficiency will need to be monitored, positive earnings estimate revisions for FY26 could extend the rally in ROKU and TWLO.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417567/should-investors-buy-roku-or-twilio-stock-after-q4-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-stocks_in_the_news-2417567">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ SoundHound AI Stock Selloff Explained - Buy More SOUN Shares? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 20:05:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Courtesy of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, <strong>SoundHound AI, Inc</strong>. SOUN stock has soared over 380% in the past year. However, its upward journey abruptly stopped, leaving investors concerned about SoundHound AI&rsquo;s prospects. Are investors panicking needlessly, or is the stock a risky but potentially rewarding investment? Let&rsquo;s explore &ndash;&nbsp;</p><h2>NVIDIA Dumps SoundHound AI, More Challenges Ahead</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">SoundHound AI stock slumped 28.1% on Friday after <strong>NVIDIA Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s NVDA latest 13-F form revealed no stake in SOUN stock for the December quarter. According to the Dow Jones Market Data, this marks one of the worst performances for the SOUN stock, second only to the 48.4% one-day decline on June 6, 2022.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of the September 13-F form, NVIDIA held 1.7 million shares of SoundHound AI, valued at $8 million. However, NVIDIA&rsquo;s sale of its entire stake raised doubts about SoundHound AI&rsquo;s future growth trajectory, leading to strong market selling.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA is looking to diversify its AI portfolio, possibly shifting its stake from voice recognition technology to cloud computing and AI infrastructure. The semiconductor giant made new investments in Chinese self-driving tech firm WeRide and <strong>Nebius Group N.V.</strong> NBIS, an AI cloud computing company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, SoundHound AI&rsquo;s lofty valuations, resource constraints, losses from heavy investments, and reliance only on equity financing may hamper future growth. <strong>Alphabet Inc.</strong> GOOGL entering SoundHound AI&rsquo;s space might also lead to stiff competition. After all, several cars, including Mercedes-Benz CLA vehicles, use Alphabet&rsquo;s conversational AI platform.</p><h2>How to Trade SOUN Stock Now?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite setbacks like NVIDIA&rsquo;s exit, the SoundHound AI stock has the wherewithal to be a long-term winner in the AI race. The loss of NVIDIA, undoubtedly, has injected short-term volatility in SOUN stock, but the company still has strong revenue growth prospects.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SoundHound AI&rsquo;s management estimated revenues to be $85 million for 2024 and $175 million for the current year, up from an earlier forecast of $80 million for 2024 and $150 million for 2025. The revenue growth projections remain impressive because of the widespread adoption of SoundHound AI&rsquo;s products. Its voice-enabled AI systems are in demand among electric vehicle manufacturers and quick-service restaurants like <strong>Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.</strong> CMG.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the time being, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged in its latest policy meeting; this won&rsquo;t affect SoundHound AI&rsquo;s cash flows. Moreover, NVIDIA&rsquo;s stake in SoundHound AI was minuscule, and won&rsquo;t have a material impact on the voice AI platform provider&rsquo;s business.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, risk-tolerant investors who believe in SoundHound AI&rsquo;s long-term potential should treat Friday&rsquo;s selloff as a buying opportunity. Some cautious investors may wait to see how SoundHound AI&rsquo;s outlook unfolds. (read more: Is Under $20 SoundHound AI Stock the Next NVIDIA, and a Buy?).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SoundHound AI has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417564/soundhound-ai-stock-selloff-explained-buy-more-soun-shares?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|investment_ideas-2417564">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ What's Behind Meta's Record Rally? Should We Stay Invested? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 20:05:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Meta Platforms, Inc.</strong> META is a well-known social media company with top apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta&rsquo;s shares surged this year mainly due to its focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Now, let&rsquo;s determine if it&rsquo;s a good time to stay invested in Meta.</p><h2>Meta Stock Rallies 20 Sessions Straight&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta stock hasn&rsquo;t finished in the red in any of the trading sessions in February. Instead, the magnificent 7-stock notched 20 successive days of gains on Friday. Meta had only five losing sessions this year and has never had a losing session since Donald Trump became the 47th U.S. President.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So far this year, Meta has been the best performer among the magnificent seven stocks, up 25.8%. Meta stock soared to a record high of $736.67 on Friday, a 600% increase from its fall 2022 low when the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to tame 40-year high inflation.&nbsp;</p><h2>Meta to Pour Billions Into AI</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta&rsquo;s clear intention to make a mark in the high-growth potential AI market has bolstered investors&rsquo; sentiment and relentlessly helped its stock price scale upward. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently stated that the company intends to spend $60 billion to $65 billion in AI infrastructure and strengthen its position amongst rivals like <strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong> MSFT, its partner OpenAI and <strong>Alphabet Inc.</strong> GOOGL.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta plans to invest in AI-powered humanoid robots for physical tasks, while Zuckerberg expects Llama 4 to be the most widely used advanced large language model (LLM) this year. The company&rsquo;s highly personalized AI assistant, Meta AI, is set to assist 1 billion users this year, and a new 2-gigawatt data center in Louisiana is in the works.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta is one of the primary buyers of <strong>NVIDIA Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s NVDA chips and aims to have 1.3 million graphics processing units by the end of the year. Meta is intensifying its AI development by replacing underperforming employees and recruiting new talent to lead the AI competition.</p><h2>Consider Keeping Meta Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Meta&rsquo;s AI initiatives, particularly with Llama 4, hold potential for long-term growth due to its agentic capabilities in addressing complex issues for users. Secondly, the company&rsquo;s AI engineering agent can compete with a mid-level engineer, a ground-breaking innovation that can bolster the stock price.

<![CDATA[ Add These 4 Top-Ranked Liquid Stocks to Boost Portfolio Returns ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The liquidity of a stock is an important parameter that investors should consider while adding stocks to their portfolios. Liquidity primarily determines a company&rsquo;s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors can consider adding four top-ranked stocks, such as <strong>Accel Entertainment, Inc.</strong> ACEL, <strong>Frontdoor, Inc. </strong>FTDR, <strong>EverQuote, Inc</strong>. EVER and <strong>Roku, Inc.</strong> ROKU to their portfolios to boost returns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liquid stocks have always been in demand owing to their potential to provide maximum returns. However, one should be alert enough before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is clearing its dues faster than peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.</p><h2>Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Current Ratio</strong>: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. The ratio gauges a company&rsquo;s potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio &mdash; the working capital ratio &mdash; below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. A high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also indicate that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Quick Ratio</strong>: Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio &mdash; the &ldquo;acid-test ratio&rdquo; or &ldquo;quick assets ratio&rdquo; &mdash; indicates a company&rsquo;s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. A quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable, like the current ratio.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cash Ratio</strong>: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company&rsquo;s ability to meet existing debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A ratio greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always represent a company&rsquo;s financial condition.</p><h2>Screening Parameters: Asset Ratio, Growth Score</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">To pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization &mdash; a widely used measure of a company&rsquo;s efficiency &mdash; as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales in the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their industries can be considered efficient.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We added our proprietary Growth Score to the screen to ensure these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3:</strong> While liquidity ratios greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Asset utilization is more significant than the industry average</strong>: Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company&rsquo;s efficiency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Zacks Rank equal to #1</strong>: Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through. You can see<strong> the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Growth Score less than or equal to B</strong>: Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B handily beat other stocks when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These criteria have narrowed the universe of more than 7,700 stocks to only seven.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screen:</p><h2><strong>Accel Entertainment</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Accel Entertainment</strong> is a distributed gaming operator offering turnkey full-service gaming solutions to authorized non-casino locations such as truck stops, bars, restaurants, convenience stores and fraternal and veteran establishments, primarily in the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company recently acquired 85% of the ownership interests of Toucan Gaming, LLC and LSM Gaming, LLC for $40 million to expand its market footprint. Both are Louisiana-based route operators and owners of several licensed video poker establishments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the last reported quarter, ACEL reported revenues of $302.2 million, up 5.1% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA of $45.9 million rose 3.9% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at 90 cents per share, unchanged in past seven days. ACEL has a Growth Score of B and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 26.1%, on average.</p><h2><strong>Frontdoor</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Frontdoor </strong>is the parent company of home service plan brands like American Home Shield, HSA, Landmark and OneGuard. The company&#39;s customizable home service plans help customers protect and maintain their homes from costly and unplanned breakdowns of essential home systems and appliances.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">FTDR recently acquired 2-10 Home Buyers Warranty in an all-cash transaction for $585 million. This particular buyout diversifies Frontdoor&rsquo;s portfolio and client base. It will also increase cross-selling opportunities for FTDR&rsquo;s home warranties and on-demand services.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the last reported quarter, revenues came in at $540 million, up 3% year over year. The uptick was driven by a 4% increase in price, which was partly offset by a 1% decline from reduced volume. Further, the number of first-year Direct-to-Consumer home warranties was 271,000, up 3% sequentially. Gross margin expanded 550 basis points to 57% in the third quarter of 2024. The expansion was mainly driven by higher price and a shift to higher service fees.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It also concluded a $400 million share repurchase authorization in August 2024 and initiated a new three-year, $650 million buyback authorization in September 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $3.15 per share, unchanged in past seven days. FTDR has a Growth Score of B and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 269%, on average.</p><h2><strong>EverQuote</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EverQuote</strong>, headquartered in Cambridge, MA, is an online insurance marketplace. The company&#39;s websites allow consumers to shop for auto, home, renters and life insurance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">EverQuote is gaining from its exclusive data assets and technology, deepened focus on core P&amp;C markets and a robust financial profile. It is also focused on streamlining traffic operations, boosting AI-powered bidding solutions and rolling out advanced agent technology platforms, which positions it well for long-term growth. Recovery in automotive and other insurance verticals, given auto carrier recovery and growth in revenue per quote request, bodes well. In the last reported quarter, total revenues of $144.5 million increased 163% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EVER&rsquo;s 2024 earnings is pegged at 73 cents per share, unchanged in the past 30 days. The company has a Growth Score of A and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 149.6%, on average.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Roku</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Roku </strong>is the leading TV streaming platform provider in the United States. Roku&rsquo;s performance is being driven by increased user engagement on The Roku Channel and the popularity of the Roku TV program.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company recently reported fourth-quarter 2024 results. It incurred a loss of 24 cents per share in the quarter, which came in narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 44 cents. The company had incurred a loss of 55 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenues increased 22% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level to $1.2 billion and beat the consensus mark by 4.48%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Roku continued to expand penetration in the United States, surpassing half of broadband households. Globally, Roku ended 2024 with 89.8 million streaming households and surpassed 90 million in the first week of January 2025. Fourth-quarter 2024 net adds were 4.3 million and full-year 2024 net adds were 9.8 million. The average revenue per user increased 4% year over year to $41.49 (on a trailing 12-month basis).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2025, Roku expects total net revenues of $4.61 billion, total gross profit of $2.005 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $350 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 bottom line is pegged at a loss of 80 cents per share. The consensus mark improved from a loss of 91 cents seven days ago. The company has a Growth Score of A.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Allegion plc</strong>&rsquo;s ALLE fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $1.86 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74. The bottom line increased 10.7% year over year.<br /><br /><em><strong>Stay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks </strong></em><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong>.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ALLE&rsquo;s Revenue Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Allegion&rsquo;s revenues were $945.6 million, which increased 5.4% year over year. Organic revenues increased 3.5%, driven by price realization and volume growth in the Americas region. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $939 million.<br /><br />Acquired assets boosted revenues by 2%. Forex woes left an adverse impact of 0.1%.<br /><br />ALLE reports revenues under two segments.

Dividends paid out totaled $166.9 million, reflecting an increase of 5.2% year over year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Allegion&rsquo;s 2025 Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Allegion expects revenues to increase in the range of 1-3% from the year-ago level.

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Moody&rsquo;s</strong> MCO shares touched an all-time high of $531.93 on Friday, the day after announcing solid fourth-quarter 2024 results and an impressive 2025 outlook.<br /><br />Its fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.62 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.60 and jumped 20% from the year-ago quarter figure. Robust global bond issuances and steady demand for analytics supported the results.&nbsp;<br /><br />Additionally, Moody&rsquo;s came out with a strong 2025 outlook. The company projects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $14.00-$14.50 per share. In 2024, the metric was $12.47.<br /><br />Moody&rsquo;s shares have gained 10.5% this year, outperforming the industry&rsquo;s rally of 5.2%. The stock has fared better than its close peers &ndash; <strong>S&amp;P Global Inc.</strong> SPGI, <strong>MSCI Inc.</strong> MSCI and <strong>Dun &amp; Bradstreet Holdings, Inc.</strong> DNB.<br /><br /><strong> Year-to-Date MCO Stock Price Performance</strong><br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/05/94314.jpg?v=1719525771" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Let&rsquo;s first discuss the company&rsquo;s 2025 outlook in detail and then check out other factors at play.<br /><br />Revenues are anticipated to increase in the high-single-digit percent range.&nbsp;<br /><br />Further, operating expenses are expected to rise in the low-to-mid-single-digit percent range. The company projects $80 million to $100 million in restructuring charges related to the Strategic and Operational Efficiency Restructuring Program.<br /><br />Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 50%. Last year, it was 43.8%.&nbsp;<br /><br />On a GAAP basis, earnings are projected to be within $12.75-$13.25 per share. In 2024, GAAP earnings were $11.26 per share.</p><h2>Other Major Factors at Play for Moody&rsquo;s</h2><p><strong>Inorganic Expansion Initiatives: </strong>In January, Moody&rsquo;s announced a deal to acquire CAPE Analytics, a leader in geospatial artificial intelligence (AI) for residential and commercial properties. Further, in 2024, the company acquired Numerated Growth Technologies and Praedicat. Through these buyouts, the company intends to pursue growth in areas outside the core credit ratings service.<br /><br />Moreover, in July 2024, MCO established a strategic alliance with MSCI to enhance its environmental, social and governance (ESG) solutions and acquired a 100% stake in GCR to deepen its presence in Africa&rsquo;s domestic credit market.&nbsp;<br /><br />Over the years, Moody&rsquo;s has been strengthening its footprint and credit rating solutions through strategic acquisitions/partnerships. In 2023, it acquired SCRiesgo to boost its presence in Central America and the Dominican Republic. It announced a partnership in Vietnam, VIS Rating, to bolster its presence in the country&rsquo;s financial sector. Its inorganic growth efforts are expected to help diversify revenues and provide it with increased scale and cross-selling opportunities across products and vertical markets.<br /><br /><strong> Strong Balance Sheet &amp; Liquidity:</strong> Moody&rsquo;s diversifying efforts are well supported by a strong balance sheet position. As of Dec. 31, 2024, it had total debt worth $6.73 billion, an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1.25 billion, and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.97 billion. These will enable it to continue pursuing growth opportunities.<br /><br />For 2025, Moody&rsquo;s expects cash flow from operations of $2.75-$2.95 billion and free cash flow in the range of $2.40-$2.60 billion.<br /><br />Driven by a solid liquidity position, MCO has an impressive capital distribution activity. In February, Moody&rsquo;s announced an 11% hike in quarterly dividend to 94 cents per share. The company increased its dividend six times in the past five years, and its payout has grown 10.65% over the same period. MCO&#39;s payout ratio currently sits at 27% of earnings.<br /><br />Further, in October 2024, the company announced an additional $1.5 billion in share repurchase authority. As of Dec. 31, 2024, it had nearly $1.6 billion worth of shares available. Driven by its earnings strength and a strong balance sheet position, Moody&#39;s is expected to continue efficient capital distributions.</p><h2>A Few Concerns Persist for Moody&rsquo;s</h2><p><strong>Mounting Costs:</strong> Moody&rsquo;s has been witnessing a persistent rise in expenses. Operating expenses witnessed a five-year (2019-2024) CAGR of 7.1%, mainly due to an increase in selling, general and administrative costs. Costs are expected to remain elevated as the company continues to invest in franchises and grow inorganically. Inflation, too, is likely to contribute to the cost increase.<br /><br /><strong>Stiff Competition:</strong> Moody&rsquo;s faces severe competition in most of the markets in which it operates. In the credit rating sector, it faces competition from Fitch, S&amp;P Ratings Services (a division of S&amp;P Global), Morningstar and many other regional providers. In the analytics segment, it faces competition from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Bloomberg, IBM and Fiserv, among others.<br /><br />Further, in the risk management software market, MCO competes with large software developers like SAS, Oracle, IBM and Mysis. Stiff competition will likely continue to put pressure on pricing, which may hurt its profitability.</p><h2>MCO&rsquo;s Bullish Analyst Expectations</h2><p>Earnings estimates for Moody&rsquo;s have moved upward for both 2025 and 2026 in the past week. The positive estimate revision depicts bullish sentiments for the stock.<br /><br /><strong> Earnings Estimate Trend</strong><br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8e/94313.jpg?v=702497229" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Further, driven by upward estimate revision activity, the estimate for 2025 indicates year-over-year growth of 8.1% and the same for 2026 suggests a 13.7% rise. MCO has a long-term EPS growth rate of 12.8%.<br /><br /><strong> Earnings Estimates</strong><br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9d/94312.jpg?v=271127383" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong>Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks </strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong>.</p><h2>Moody&rsquo;s Stock: A Perfect Investment</h2><p>As the operating environment continues to improve, issuance volumes are expected to keep rising. Further, demand for corporate refinancing is expected to rise as the monetary policy gradually changes globally. Also, demand for analytics will likely support profitability driven by the company&rsquo;s inorganic growth efforts.<br /><br />Yet, elevated expenses and pricing pressure because of stiff competition across its businesses are woes. Nonetheless, Moody&rsquo;s solid liquidity and balance sheet position and enhanced capital distributions are tailwinds. With strong earnings projections, the company is well-poised to deliver sustained growth. We believe the MCO stock is an ideal candidate for investors&#39; portfolio.<br /><br />At present, Moody&rsquo;s carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Five9</strong> FIVN is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Thursday.<br /><br />The company expects fourth-quarter revenues in the range of $267-$268 million. For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $267.49 million, suggesting an 11.89% rise from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.<br /><br />Non-GAAP net income per share is expected in the range of 69-71 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at 70 cents per share, indicating an increase of 14.75% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. The figure has remained unchanged over the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/94/94294.jpg?v=413513700" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar</strong></em>.<br /><br />Five9 has a positive earnings surprise history. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 15.52%. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 22.46%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Five9, Inc. Stock Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Five9, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/62/1739881755.png" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Five9, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Five9, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Whispers for FIVN</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Five9 this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />FIVN has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors to Note for FIVN Ahead of Q4 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Five9 appears well-positioned heading into its fourth-quarter 2024 earnings, with several tailwinds supporting a BUY recommendation. The company&#39;s expanding artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and strong subscription revenue growth trajectory suggest continued momentum. In third-quarter 2024, Five9 demonstrated accelerating growth with subscription revenues increasing 20% year over year, up from 17% in the previous quarter. This acceleration in the company&#39;s core revenue stream indicates strong underlying business fundamentals. The fourth-quarter guidance of $267-$268 million in revenues appears achievable given the company&#39;s recent performance and execution.<br /><br />The company&#39;s AI initiatives have gained significant traction, with AI products comprising more than 20% of enterprise new logo Annual Contract Value bookings in the third quarter. Notably, deals, including AI components, were approximately 5x larger than those without AI, and AI was included in 100% of deals exceeding $1 million in ARR. This trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, supported by the launch of new AI capabilities and growing enterprise adoption.<br /><br />Five9&#39;s recent acquisition of Acqueon, while contributing less than 1% to third-quarter revenues, should begin showing a more meaningful impact in the fourth quarter as integration progresses. The addition strengthens Five9&#39;s omnichannel capabilities and expands its addressable market, particularly in healthcare through Epic integration. Enterprise customer momentum remains strong, with the company achieving record enterprise new logo turnups in the third quarter. The $1 million-plus ARR customer segment, representing approximately 56% of subscription revenues, grew 29% year over year. This enterprise traction is likely to have persisted in the fourth quarter, driven by ongoing cloud migration trends and AI adoption.<br /><br />The company&#39;s adjusted EBITDA margin reached 20% in the third quarter, with management expecting continued margin expansion. Strong operating cash flow of $41 million (16% of revenue) in the third quarter demonstrates improving operational efficiency. This trend is expected to have continued in the fourth quarter. However, the CCaaS market is becoming increasingly competitive, with both established players and new entrants investing heavily in AI capabilities. This intensifying competition from major CCaaS providers like<strong> Twilio</strong> TWLO, <strong>RingCentral</strong> RNG and <strong>Zoom</strong> ZM Contact Center might have pressured growth rates and margins in the quarter under review.<br /><br />While macroeconomic uncertainties and competition persist, Five9&#39;s strategic positioning in the contact center cloud transition, growing AI capabilities, and improving profitability metrics make it an attractive investment heading into fourth-quarter earnings.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">FIVN Price Performance &amp; Stock Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Five9 shares have plunged 44.8% in the past year, underperforming the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&amp;P 500 index&rsquo;s return of 26.2% and 23.3%, respectively.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">1-Year FIVN Stock Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/79/94295.jpg?v=43440433" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">While Five9&#39;s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 34.63x appears elevated compared to the Zacks Internet - Software industry average of 8.41x, there are several compelling factors that justify the premium valuation and support a buy recommendation. The higher multiple reflects Five9&#39;s strong market position in the rapidly growing cloud contact center market and its successful execution in monetizing AI capabilities.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">FIVN&rsquo;s EV/EBITDA Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/4e/94296.jpg?v=1813471789" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Investment Thesis for Five9</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Five9 presents a compelling investment opportunity ahead of its fourth-quarter 2024 results, driven by its strong positioning in the rapidly evolving contact center-as-a-service (CCaaS) market. The company&#39;s robust AI momentum, with AI products contributing more than 20% of enterprise new logo bookings and deals, including AI components being 5x larger, demonstrates its technological leadership.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The accelerating subscription revenue growth of 20% year over year, expanding EBITDA margins at 20%, and strong enterprise customer traction make Five9 an attractive investment. With its recent Acqueon acquisition enhancing omnichannel capabilities and the continued shift toward cloud-based contact centers, Five9 is well-positioned for sustained growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Five9 stands out as a compelling investment opportunity ahead of fourth-quarter 2024 earnings, driven by accelerating subscription revenue growth, expanding AI adoption, and robust enterprise momentum. With strengthening margins, strategic Acqueon integration, and leadership in the CCaaS market transformation, the company is well-positioned to deliver continued growth. Investors should consider adding FIVN to their portfolios at current levels.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417562/five9-q4-earnings-preview-should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2417562">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>Regional Management Corp.</strong> RM have lost 2% since it reported fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 5.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chevron Corporation </strong>CVX, the U.S. oil and gas giant, and its consortium partners, Shell plc. and NewMed Energy, have received approval for the updated development and production plan (DPP) for the Aphrodite gas development from Cyprus&rsquo; Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry. The updated DPP was submitted by the Chevron-led consortium in 2024 and is estimated to cost$4 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Key Infrastructure Plans</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The updated DPP is aimed at accelerating the technical and engineering stages of the project. This should lead to front-end engineering and design (FEED), and ultimately, the Final Investment Decision (FID) for the Aphrodite gas field. &nbsp;The approved plan also covers the construction of a floating production unit (FPU) above the Aphrodite field&rsquo;s reservoir and the installation of subsea pipelines for exporting gas to Egypt.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Production and Transmission Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The FPU for the Aphrodite field is anticipated to have a maximum production capacity of 800 million cubic feet (MMCF) of gas per day. At the initial stage, the gas will be extracted through four producing wells and then transported through a subsea pipeline linked to the Egyptian transmission system, per NewMed Energy.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Amendment Made to the Production Sharing Contract</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Following the Cypriot government&rsquo;s approval, an amendment was made to the gas field&#39;s Production Sharing Contract. This amendment, aimed at revising the milestones set for its development, has been signed between the Cypriot government and the field partners. Among other milestones, it includes a commitment to reach an FID for the gas field&#39;s development in 2027.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As mentioned, the total cost of the project was estimated to be $4 billion, prior to the completion of technical and economic feasibility studies. This also includes the FEED and pre-FEED study related to the updated development plan. The updated development plan shall be realized subject to the performance of the pre-FEED and the FEED studies, among other factors. The results of these studies will also decide if an FID can be reached.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Regional Benefits to the Development of the Gas Field</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">CVX mentioned that it values its partnership with the Republic of Cyprus. The development of the Aphrodite gas field should benefit the national and eastern Mediterranean regions as well. Furthermore, natural gas, being a cleaner burning fuel, should align with Chevron&rsquo;s broader strategy to provide greener and more reliable energy to its customers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Aphrodite gas field is located nearly 160km toward the south of Limassol, at water depths of 1,700 meters. Production from this field is estimated to begin in 2031.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CVX&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">CVX currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks from the energy&nbsp;sector are <strong>SM Energy </strong>SM, <strong>Equinor ASA</strong> EQNR and <strong>Archrock Inc.</strong> AROC. SM Energy currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Equinor and Archrock carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. <strong>You can see&nbsp;</strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here<strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">SM Energy is set to expand its oil-centered operations in the coming years, with an increasing focus on crude oil, especially in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford regions. The increased production, combined with the favorable oil price environment, is expected to positively contribute to its bottom line.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Equinor ASA is one of the leading integrated energy companies globally and the second-largest supplier of natural gas in Europe. The company&rsquo;s expansion in the renewable energy space positions it for long-term growth as more and more countries transition toward cleaner energy solutions to meet their climate goals. Its strategic pivot toward low-carbon energy solutions unlocks new revenue streams in the growing market for clean energy and carbon management solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Archrock is an energy infrastructure company based in the United States, with a focus on midstream natural gas compression. It provides natural gas contract compression services and generates stable fee-based revenues.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417548/chevron-receives-approval-for-aphrodite-gas-field-development?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_energy_sector-2417548">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Investment Banks Set to Gain in Trump 2.0? ETFs to Benefit ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investment banks are set to thrive under President Donald Trump&rsquo;s second term, according to Kingsley Jones, founder and chief investment officer at Jevons Global. Speaking to CNBC&rsquo;s Martin Soong, the Australian investor expressed optimism about Wall Street&rsquo;s performance, highlighting a favorable environment for financial stocks.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Regulatory Changes and Trade Policies Favor Banks</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Jones pointed to Trump&rsquo;s pro-business stance, which includes loosening deal-making regulations and implementing trade tariffs that could refocus business activity on the United States. These factors, he argued, create opportunities for financial institutions to expand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Among his top picks, Jones named <strong>JPMorgan</strong> JPM and <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> (GS) as standout investment opportunities. This puts focus on JPM-heavy exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like <strong>iShares U.S. Financial Services ETF </strong>IYG, <strong>iShares U.S. Financials ETF </strong>IYF and <strong>Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund </strong>XLF. The Goldman-heavy ETF includes <strong>iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers &amp; Securities Exchanges ETF </strong>IAI.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Strong Market Performance and Revenue Projections</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The banking sector recently recorded a historic quarter, driven by heightened trading activity and increased deal-making around the Presidential election. Trump&rsquo;s return to office is expected to further boost investment banking revenues, with Coalition Greenwich forecasting total income to reach $316 billion in 2025, according to Reuters. Additionally, M&amp;A bankers could generate $27.6 billion in fees, making it one of the most profitable years in the past two decades.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon reinforced this positive sentiment in January, attributing the surge in deal-making to &ldquo;a meaningful shift in CEO confidence&rdquo; and a more favorable regulatory landscape under Trump&rsquo;s leadership.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Global M&amp;A Activity </span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Global M&amp;A demonstrated signs of recovery in the fourth quarter, with 9,765 deals announced &mdash; marking the highest number since Q1 of 2023. The second half of 2024 also recorded deal volumes at $1.1 trillion, the maximum since H1 of 2022, when M&amp;A activity began to decline following hawkish central banks (read: Upbeat Year Ahead for Mergers and Acquisitions? ETFs to Consider).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The United States accounted for 54% of global M&amp;A activity on an annual basis, generating $7.2 trillion from U.S. targets compared to $6.3 trillion from non-U.S. targets. Despite the appealing M&amp;A market in the United States, fourth-quarter activity declined by nearly 30% compared to the same period in 2023, due to tough year-over-year comparisons.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Financials led the fourth-quarter performance with $90.1 billion, driven by four transactions in the top 10 for the quarter, followed by materials and industrials. Easing financial market conditions, fueled by the Fed&#39;s moderate level of interest rate cuts and moderating inflation, play a key role in driving the M&amp;A market.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;">Any Wall of Worry?</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Trump tariffs may stoke inflation all over again, leading the Fed to act less dovish in the coming days. In that case, deal makers won&rsquo;t be able to enjoy the easy financing backdrop fully. Still, the broader market calls for an upbeat deal-making environment. Investors can cash in on the trend with the help of ETFs like <strong>NYLI Merger Arbitrage ETF</strong> MNA, <strong>AltShares Merger Arbitrage ETF</strong> ARB, <strong>FirstTrust Merger Arbitrage ETF</strong> MARB and <strong>Proshares Merger ETF </strong>MRGR.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417546/investment-banks-set-to-gain-in-trump-2-0-etfs-to-benefit?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2417546">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BHP Group</strong> BHP reported underlying attributable profit from continuing operations of around $5.1 billion in the first half of fiscal 2025 (ended Dec. 31, 2024). The figure was 23% lower than a year ago, reflecting BHP&rsquo;s productivity initiatives and cost discipline, and higher copper prices offset by lower iron ore and steelmaking coal prices as well as labor costs.

Earnings per American Depositary Share (ADS) were $2.00 for the first half of fiscal 2025 compared with $2.59 in the first half of the previous fiscal. BHP&rsquo;s ADS represents two fully-paid ordinary shares.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the period under discussion, BHP&rsquo;s attributable profit (for total operations) surged 376% year over year to $4.4 billion, driven by disciplined cost control and strong operational performance. The company had reported an attributable profit of $927 million in the first half of fiscal 2024. The figure included an exceptional item of around $2.9 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Low Iron Ore Prices Hurt BHP&rsquo;s 1H25 Revenues</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues in the first half of fiscal 2025 totaled $25.18 billion, down 8% year over year. This reflected lower iron ore and steelmaking coal prices, partially offset by higher realized copper prices.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Iron ore segment&rsquo;s revenues were down 18.2% year over year to $11.5 billion, due to lower iron ore prices. The Copper segment reported revenues of $10.27 billion, up 18.6% year over year on higher copper prices.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues in the Coal segment slumped 26% year over year to $2.8 billion, reflecting lower Steelmaking coal prices.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s Underlying EBITDA Down 11%</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Profit from operations was $9.1 billion in the first half of fiscal 2025 compared with $4.8 billion in the last fiscal year&rsquo;s comparable period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) declined 11% year over year to $12.36 billion owing to lower revenues. The underlying EBITDA margin was 49.1% compared with 51% in last year&rsquo;s comparable period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the Iron ore segment, underlying EBITDA slumped 25.6% year on year to $7.2 billion. The Copper segment&rsquo;s underlying EBITDA was up 44.3% to $5 billion on higher sales and volumes. The Coal segment&rsquo;s underlying EBITDA was $0.57 billion, which marked a substantial drop from $0.98 billion in the first half of fiscal 2024.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s Financial Position</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, BHP Group had cash and cash equivalents of $9.56 billion, down from $12.4 billion as of June 30, 2024. In the half year ended Dec. 31, 2024, the company generated $11.8 billion of net operating cash flow, lower than the $12.4 billion recorded in the prior-year comparable period. The decline was due to lower realized prices, particularly in iron ore.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Free cash flow for the period under discussion was $2.6 billion.<br />Net debt was $11.8 billion at the end of the first half of fiscal 2025, lower than $12.6 billion at the end of the first half of fiscal 2024.<br /><br />BHP&rsquo;s board has announced an interim dividend of 50 cents per share, which is equivalent to a total payout of $2.5 billion (payout ratio of 50%).<br />Capital and exploration spending was $5.2 billion in the first half of fiscal 2025, which was 10% higher year over year. BHP has earmarked capital and exploration expenditures of $10 billion for fiscal 2025 and $11 billion for fiscal 2026.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s FY25 Production Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s iron ore production guidance for fiscal 2025 is 255-265.5 Mt. WAIO&#39;s production is expected in the band of 250-260 Mt (282-294 Mt on a 100% basis).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company expects copper production to be within the range of 1,845-2,045 kt in fiscal 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Steelmaking coal production in fiscal 2025 is now expected to be in the upper half of the range of 16.5-19 Mt (33 -38 Mt on a 100% basis). Energy coal production is also expected to be in the upper half of the company&rsquo;s range of 13 - 15 Mt.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s Cost Guidance for FY25</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Unit cost guidance for WAIO is in the range of $18.00-$19.50 per ton. Escondida unit cost is estimated to be in the band of $1.30-$1.60 per pound. Spence unit costs are expected to be between $2.00 and $2.30 per pound. Copper South Australia&rsquo;s unit cost is anticipated to be between $1.30 and $1.80 per pound. BMA unit cost is expected to be between $112 and $124 per ton.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">BHP Group&#39;s shares have lost 14.6% over the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s 8.7% decline.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9f/94349.jpg?v=241023040" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">BHP currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Recent Earnings Performances of BHP&rsquo;s Peers</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Freeport-McMoRan Inc.</strong> FCX recorded net income of $274 million or 19 cents per share for fourth-quarter 2024, down around 29.3% from $388 million or 27 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues declined nearly 3.1% year over year to $5,720 million.

The bottom line, however, marked a 74% surge from the year-ago quarter. Results were driven by higher sales volumes for copper, zinc and silver as well as improved prices. SCCO&rsquo;s fourth-quarter performance was partially hurt by a decline in the molybdenum sales volume.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company posted sales of $2.784 billion, which beat the consensus estimate of $2.780 billion. The top line increased 21.3% year over year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s Peer Awaiting Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vale S.A</strong> VALE is set to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 19, after market close.

<![CDATA[ Marathon Stock Declines 15% in 3 Months: A Buying Opportunity? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. </strong>MARA stock has declined 15% over the past three months compared with the industry&#39;s impressive 29% rally. Over this period, MARA&rsquo;s competitors in the bitcoin-mining space, like <strong>Riot Platforms, Inc.</strong> RIOT, have consolidated, and <strong>HuT 8 Corp.</strong> HUT has dropped 19%.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d3/94361.jpg?v=1322769119" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>This analysis will explore MARA&#39;s performance to assess whether its current levels offer an attractive entry point for investors.</p><h2>Trump&#39;s Win Should Fuel Crypto Market and MARA</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">We believe the stock has upside potential following Donald Trump&rsquo;s election victory, fueled by investor optimism about potential pro-digital asset policies under his administration. Trump&#39;s previous statements favoring deregulation and innovation in financial markets have sparked hopes for a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, which could benefit companies like Marathon engaged in Bitcoin mining.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A supportive stance could reduce compliance hurdles, incentivizing further investments in the sector. The possibility of broader adoption of digital currencies under a less restrictive framework has bolstered confidence in cryptocurrency-related stocks, driving MARA&#39;s upward momentum and reinforcing its appeal to growth-focused investors.</p><h2>MARA Boosts Mining Capacity, Aims to Slash Costs</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MARA continues to commit to scaling operations and enhancing efficiencies. In the third quarter of 2024, the company increased its interconnect-approved capacity by 372 MW across three Ohio data centers, positioning itself for sustained mining expansion. MARA also acquired the Hopedale and Hannibal facilities for just $270,000 per MW, significantly below the industry average of $900,000 to $1.5 million per MW.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the company is developing a greenfield facility in Ohio, which is expected to add 150 MW of capacity. These strategic expansions support MARA&#39;s growth and reduce reliance on third-party providers. By owning and operating 65% of its 1.5 GW compute capacity, the company aims to minimize operational risks and lower costs. This vertical integration aligns with MARA&#39;s objective to lead the digital asset industry while maintaining flexibility in energy sourcing and operational strategy.</p><h2>MARA&#39;s Dual Strategy Balances Immediate and Long-Term Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MARA adopts a dual approach to Bitcoin mining, combining revenue generation with strategic asset accumulation. By leveraging its expansive and energy-efficient mining operations, the company produces Bitcoin at lower costs, ensuring consistent revenue streams. MARA retains a significant portion of the Bitcoin it mines, positioning itself to capitalize on potential price appreciation over time.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This hybrid strategy balances immediate income from Bitcoin production with long-term growth potential tied to its holdings. This approach supports operational sustainability and strengthens MARA&rsquo;s financial flexibility, enhancing its appeal to investors seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market.</p><h2>MARA&rsquo;s Strong Liquidity Position</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Marathon&rsquo;s liquidity remains robust, with a current ratio of 4 against the industry average of 2.21. A current ratio above 1 indicates that the company is well-positioned to meet its obligations. Its strong liquidity position provides the financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and weather potential market fluctuations.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/79/94362.jpg?v=1922575370" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Top-Line Growth Prospects and Bottom-Line Challenges</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marathon&rsquo;s 2024 revenues is $633 million, indicating 63.4% growth from the year-ago quarter. Sales are expected to continue their upward trajectory, with a projected year-over-year increase of 50% in 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the strong revenue growth prospects, the company&rsquo;s bottom line appears less optimistic. Marathon is expected to report a loss of 24 cents per share in 2024 against earnings of 17 cents in 2023. Loss in 2025 is expected to be around 56 cents. This suggests that while the company&rsquo;s top line is growing, its profitability is under pressure, which could lead investors to take a more cautious approach.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/af/94363.jpg?v=2034044984" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>The Right Strategy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MARA remains a cautious hold amid a mixed performance landscape. Its strategic expansion through increased mining capacity and cost-effective facility acquisitions supports long-term growth. Additionally, the prospect of a crypto-friendly regulatory environment may provide a favorable tailwind for the company. Although its revenue generation appears robust, near-term profitability continues to face challenges. The firm&rsquo;s balanced approach of combining immediate income with strategic asset accumulation, along with its strong liquidity, suggests investors should hold their positions while awaiting operational improvements and a supportive market backdrop overall.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MARA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417539/marathon-stock-declines-15-in-3-months-a-buying-opportunity?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2417539">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ The Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry continues to face challenges due to prolonged contraction in manufacturing activity. Rising input costs, labor shortages and freight expenses further strain the profitability of the industry. The imposition of tariffs is anticipated to disrupt supply chains and drive costs even further. &nbsp;<br /><br />Amid these conditions, industry players like <strong>TriMas Corporation</strong> TRS and <strong>Northwest Pipe Company</strong> NWPX are poised to benefit from their proactive cost-management actions and efforts to improve efficiency. Their continuous investments in automation, product innovation and acquisitions are anticipated to contribute to their growth.<p><b>About the Industry</b></p><p>The Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry primarily comprises metal processing and fabrication service providers that transform metals into metal parts, machinery or components used across various other industries. Their processes include forging, stamping, bending, forming and machining, which are used in shaping individual pieces of metal, and welding and assembling to join parts. The companies either use one of these processes or a combination of all. The most common raw materials utilized by metal fabrication companies include plate metal, formed or expanded metal, tube stock, welding wire or rod and casting. The industry players serve an array of markets, including construction, mining, aerospace and defense, automotive, agriculture, oil and gas, electronics/electrical components, industrial equipment and general consumer.</p><p><b>Trends Shaping the Future of the Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication Industry</b></p><p><em><strong>Prolonged Contraction and Tariff Risks Cloud Metal Products Outlook</strong></em>: Per the Fed&rsquo;s latest industrial production report, the aggregate production of fabricated metal products in the United States was down 1.3% in the 12 months ended January 2025.&nbsp; The Institute for Supply Management&rsquo;s manufacturing index had been in contraction for 26 consecutive months until it saw a modest increase to 50.9% in January 2025. However, the fabricated metal products industry remained one of the eight industries still in contraction. The industry meanwhile reported growth in new orders in January. However, sustained growth remains uncertain. The imposition of tariffs by President Trump could disrupt supply chains and derail this recent recovery in U.S. manufacturing.</p><p><em><strong>High Costs &amp; Tariff Concerns Ail the Industry</strong></em>: The industry has been experiencing significant inflation levels, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The companies are witnessing labor shortages for some positions and incurring steep labor costs to meet demand. The industry players are focusing on pricing actions, cost-cutting measures, efforts to improve productivity and efficiency, and the diversification of the supplier bases to mitigate some headwinds. Also, the imposition of tariffs is anticipated to lead to higher costs for the industry.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Automation &amp; End-Market Growth to Act as Catalysts</strong></em>: The industry&rsquo;s customer-focused approach to provide cost-effective technical solutions, automation to increase efficiency and lower labor costs, and the development of innovative products will drive growth in the days ahead. Improvements in end-use sectors, such as manufacturing, aerospace and automotive, are anticipated to benefit the metal fabrication market over the next few years. Developing countries hold promise due to rapid industrialization. This, in turn, is likely to create demand.</p><p><b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim Prospects</b></p><p>The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates tepid prospects in the near term. The Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry, a nine-stock group within the broader Industrial Products sector,&nbsp;currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #221, which places it in the bottom 11% of the 252 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.<br /><br />Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential. The industry&#39;s earnings estimates for 2025 have moved down 4% since the beginning of this year.</p><p>Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let us look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.</p><p><b>Industry Vs. Broader Market</b></p><p>The Zacks Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication industry has outperformed its sector and Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.<br /><br />Over this period, the industry has grown 34.4% compared with the sector&rsquo;s increase of 6.4% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s rise of 23.3%.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One-Year Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/metalprice_20250218.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 319px;" /></p><p><br />&nbsp;</p><p><b>Industry's Current Valuation</b></p><p>Based on the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing the Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication companies, the industry is currently trading at 18.61 compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 13.96 and the Industrial Products sector&rsquo;s forward 12-month EV/EBITDA of 18.61. This is shown in the charts below.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) F12M Ratio</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/metalvalsp_20250218.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 216px;" /></p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) F12M Ratio</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/metalvalsec_20250218.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 216px;" /></p><p>Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 31.97 and as low as 4.20, with the median at 9.76.</p><p><b>2 Metal Products - Procurement and Fabrication Stocks to Keep Tabs on</b></p><p><strong>Northwest Pipe</strong>: The company recently received a U.S. Patent for the InfraShield Joint System, an innovative solution to strengthen the resilience of steel pipelines. It has been implementing cost-reduction techniques and actions to enhance operating efficiency, which will support margins. Rising demand for developed water sources and the pressing need to upgrade, repair and replace the aging U.S water and wastewater systems present significant opportunities for NWPX. The company continues strengthening its liquidity by repaying debt and generating strong cash flow from operations, supported by effective working capital management. Northwest Pipe&rsquo;s growth strategy has been focused on improving the Precast business to reduce the cyclicality of the Steel Pressure Pipe operations and increasing overall margins and cash flow. The company also continues to look for growth opportunities through expansion or acquisitions.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vancouver, WA-based Northwest Pipe&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings has remained unchanged over the past 60 days. The estimate indicates growth of 5.1% from the year-earlier number. NWPX has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.5%, on average. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a long-term estimated earnings growth of 5%.</p><p><span style="pd4ml-display: none; pd4ml-visibility: hidden;">You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>. </span></p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: NWPX</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/nwpx_20250218.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 355px;" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TriMas</strong>: The company&rsquo;s packaging segment is benefiting from the gradual recovery in the consumer goods and industrial markets, and improving order intake.&nbsp; The Aerospace segment is poised for growth on solid backlog, order intake and operational excellence initiatives. The company recently closed the acquisition of Germany-based GMT Aerospace, a manufacturer of tie rods used in a range of structural aerospace applications. This move will add the first manufacturing location in Europe for the Aerospace segment. This is in sync with TriMas&rsquo; strategy to accelerate growth through acquisitions, particularly in its Packaging and Aerospace platforms. The company has a strong pipeline of products and process innovation, which will sustain long-term growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bloomfield Hills, MI-based TriMas&rsquo; fiscal 2025 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 20.7%. The estimate has moved up 2% over the past 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: TRS</h3><h3 style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/trs_20250218(1).jpg" /></h3><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2417458/2-metal-fabrication-stocks-to-watch-despite-ongoing-industry-weakness?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-industry_outlook-2417458">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ LUV Plans to Lay Off 15% of Workforce to Achieve Cost Efficiency ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Southwest Airlines Co. (</strong>LUV<strong>)</strong> announced plans to lay off a certain portion of its workforce. The move is part of the company&rsquo;s transformational plan to simplify its organizational structure, stay competitive, reduce operating costs and increase efficiency.</p><h2>Details of LUV&rsquo;s Downsizing &amp; Its Expected Benefits</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">LUV&rsquo;s lay off plans are targeted on corporate overhead and leadership positions. LUV aims to cut 15% of its corporate positions (which includes senior leadership and directors) by the end of the second quarter of 2025, which reflects approximately 1,750 employee roles. Eleven senior leadership positions (which include vice president and above) also account for the 15% of the LUV&rsquo;s senior management committee and will be eliminated as part of this restructuring.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Southwest Airlines expects the layoffs to result in cost savings. The company estimates to save about $210 million this year and roughly $300 million in 2026.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These savings exclude an expected one-time charge of $60-$80 million in the first quarter of 2025 (related to severance payments and post-employment benefits, which are likely to be considered as a special item). One-time costs vary based on specific employee elections during the workforce reduction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bob Jordan, president, chief executive officer &amp; vice chairman of LUV&rsquo;s board of directors, stated, &ldquo;This decision is unprecedented in our 53-year history, and change requires that we make difficult decisions. We are at a pivotal moment as we transform Southwest Airlines into a leaner, faster, and more agile organization.&rdquo; He further added, &ldquo;I arrived at this decision thoughtfully and carefully, knowing how hard it will be to say goodbye to colleagues who have been a significant part of our Southwest Culture and accomplishments. I&rsquo;m grateful to all Southwest Employees who have shared in our legendary history and to those that will guide us into the next era of Southwest Airlines.&rdquo;</p><h2>To Conclude</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">LUV has always been actively involved in its cost-saving initiatives. The company aims to minimize hiring, optimize scheduling, improve corporate efficiency and capitalize on supply-chain opportunities. These actions, in combination, are expected to exceed the $500 million cost initiative announced at LUV&rsquo;s 2024 Investor Day.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We would like to remind investors that, to reduce costs and boost profit margins, Southwest Airlines has hit the pause button for corporate hiring. This Dallas-based airline company has also decided to suspend promotions and its summer internship program, as well as eliminate some employee team-building events for the same purpose.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last month, LUV also inked a deal with Babcock &amp; Brown Aircraft Management to sell and lease back 36 Boeing 737-800 aircraft in its fleet to raise cash. The transaction should help the Dallas-based carrier raise cash, ease the pressure on its balance sheet and strengthen its financial position.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given this encouraging backdrop, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 13.3% over the past six months compared with 29.8% growth of the Zacks Airline industry.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Six-Month Price Comparison</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/df/94354.jpg?v=2004875244" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Other Airline Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the Zacks Airline industry may also consider&nbsp;<strong>United Airlines</strong> UAL and <strong>SkyWest</strong> SKYW. Each stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">United Airlines has an expected earnings growth rate of 21.11% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL&rsquo;s 2025 earnings per share has been revised 10.6% upward in the past 60 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has an encouraging track record with respect to the earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters. The average beat is 22.93%. Shares of UAL have surged 161.2% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SkyWest</strong>, founded in 1972, is based in St. George and operates regional jets for major U.S. airlines. SKYW&rsquo;S track record of successfully meeting the requirements of each of its airline heavyweight partners bodes well for the company. Revenues from flying agreements (which account for the bulk of the top line) are impressive owing to SKYW&rsquo;s above ability. Owing to an uptick in air travel demand, passenger volumes have been upbeat and are likely to increase going forward as well. This is likely to keep SKYW&#39;s top line in good shape.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SKYW has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company&#39;s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 16.71%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings per share has been revised 7.9% upward in the past 60 days.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417536/luv-plans-to-lay-off-15-of-workforce-to-achieve-cost-efficiency?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_corporate_actions-2417536">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Comfort Systems USA, Inc. </strong>FIX is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 20, after the closing bell.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em><br /><br />In the last reported quarter, Comfort Systems delivered record earnings, fueled by strong execution and robust demand in key industrial and institutional markets. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $4.09, beating Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1% and increasing 40% from a year ago, while revenue grew 31.5% to $1.81 billion. The company reported $238 million in quarterly EBITDA, a 53% increase year over year. Even without contributions from recent acquisitions, same-store EBITDA rose more than 30%, indicating that core operations are driving significant profit expansion.<br /><br />Comfort Systems has an impressive track record of surpassing earnings expectations, exceeding the consensus mark in each of the last four quarters. The average surprise over this period is 14.7%, as shown in the chart below.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/64/94367.jpg?v=2071592826" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>How Are Estimates Placed for FIX Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter EPS has remained unchanged at $3.43 over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 34.5% increase from the year-ago reported EPS of $2.55. Also, the consensus mark for revenues is $1.75 billion, indicating 29.3% year-over-year growth.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/61/94365.jpg?v=859639506" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>What Our Model Indicates for FIX Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for FIX this time around. The company does not possess the right combination of the two key ingredients &mdash; a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) &mdash; to increase the odds of an earnings beat.<br /><br /><strong>Earnings ESP:</strong> FIX has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank: </strong>The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Factors Influencing Q4 Performance for Comfort Systems</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Comfort Systems is expected to witness solid growth in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by strong demand in the technology and manufacturing sectors. Its Mechanical segment (which accounted for 79.4% of its third-quarter total revenues) and the Electrical segment (which accounted for 20.6% of its total revenues) have been benefiting from solid demand, particularly data centers, chip plants, food, and pharmaceuticals. The company&#39;s backlog is strategically aligned with high-demand areas such as data centers, chip fabrication, battery plants, life sciences, and food, positioning FIX to capitalize on sector-specific growth trends.<br /><br />Acquisitions have also been playing a crucial role in Comfort Systems&rsquo; growth, broadening its operational scope and enhancing revenue streams. The company&#39;s focus on strategic investments for improved profitability and efficient service execution, coupled with accretive buyouts, is expected to drive substantial growth in the fourth quarter. The company has entered the fourth quarter with 21% more same-store backlog than a year ago, suggesting continued strength in demand.<br /><br />Despite the strong results, challenges remain. During the third-quarter earnings call, management acknowledged the difficulty of maintaining current levels of growth amid tough year-over-year revenue comparisons in upcoming quarters. For the fourth quarter of 2024, the company expects revenue growth to align with the third-quarter performance. Margins are expected to remain strong, though seasonal factors will likely result in fourth-quarter margins coming in slightly lower than the third quarter. Comfort Systems expects EBITDA margins to remain elevated in the fourth quarter of&nbsp; 2024.<br /><br />Overall, the company&rsquo;s bottom line is likely to have witnessed solid year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter thanks to the leverage from increased revenues accompanied by operational excellence and capital allocation strategies.<br /><br />Going forward, Comfort Systems&rsquo; strategic moves toward piloting emerging technologies, engaging in partnerships with industry-leading tech firms and data analytics are likely to have sparked its growth momentum in the to-be-reported quarter and beyond.</p><h2>FIX Stock&rsquo;s Price Performance &amp; Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">FIX&rsquo;s stock has exhibited an upward movement in the six-month period.&nbsp; The stock has gained 17.5% compared with the industry&rsquo;s rise of 6.9% in the same time frame. FIX has also performed better than its peer companies like <strong>EMCOR Group, Inc</strong>. EME, which gained 15.6% during the same time frame.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FIX&rsquo;s 6-Month Price Performance</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b3/94366.jpg?v=845419834" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#39;s assess the value FIX offers to investors at its current levels.<br /><br />Presently, FIX is trading at forward 12-month earnings multiple of 23.01X, which is above its three-year median of 21.52X. In comparison, the industry&#39;s forward earnings multiple is 29.86X. This suggests that although FIX&rsquo;s valuation appears somewhat high relative to its historical range, it remains undervalued when compared to the industry average.<br /><br />The company is trading currently at a discount compared to similar industry players like <strong>Watsco, Inc. </strong>WSO and <strong>AAON, Inc. </strong>AAON but is slightly premium to EMCOR. WSO, AAON and EME have forward 12-month P/E multiples of 32.93, 36.27, and 19.06, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/13/94368.jpg?v=1750845932" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Investment Thoughts: Buy, Sell or Hold FIX Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Comfort Systems presents a compelling investment opportunity despite facing tougher prior-year comparable results for the upcoming quarters. The company expects revenue growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to the prior quarter, but sustaining more than 30% revenue growth in 2025 will be more difficult. Additionally, the normalization of pre-bookings and equipment advances might pose future cash flow challenges, but the company&#39;s strategic approach and resilient same-store activity provide a solid foundation. Labor shortages continue to be a significant challenge for the construction and industrial services industry. Comfort Systems, like many contractors, faces tight labor markets, particularly for skilled trades.<br /><br />One of the most attractive aspects of FIX is its commitment to shareholder rewards. Over the past 16 years, Comfort Systems has consistently allocated an average of 11% of its capital toward dividend payments. With steady free cash flow and a resilient balance sheet, the company has increased its dividend payout for 12 consecutive years. The company is generating record cash flow, with $572 million in free cash flow year to date (as of the third quarter of 2024) and net cash exceeding debt by $347 million. This financial strength allows the company to invest in growth and acquisitions while reducing interest costs, even after significant cash payments for recent acquisitions.<br /><br />In conclusion, despite short-term challenges, Comfort Systems&rsquo; strategic acquisitions, record backlog, and impressive valuation make it a compelling investment opportunity. The company&#39;s strategic cash management and commitment to shareholder rewards underscore its long-term growth potential. However, those looking for immediate momentum may want to wait for a better entry point or signs of stronger earnings revisions.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417537/fix-stock-before-q4-earnings-a-smart-buy-or-risky-investment?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2417537">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ PRA Group to Report Q4 Earnings: What Do the Estimates Say? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 16:59:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Financial and business services company <strong>PRA Group, Inc.&nbsp;</strong>PRAA is set to report its fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 19, 2025, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter&rsquo;s earnings and revenues is pegged at 45 cents per share and $276.77 million, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks </em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong> <strong><em>to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The earnings estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has remained stable over the past 60 days. The bottom-line projection indicates a year-over-year improvement of 304.6%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year increase of 25%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/42/94369.jpg?v=1279204436" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PRA Group&rsquo;s revenues is pegged at $1.10 billion, implying a rise of 36.8% year over year. Also, the consensus mark for current year EPS is pegged at $1.71, implying an improvement of 180.3% on a year-over-year basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PRA Group beat the consensus estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 305.3%, as you can see below.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PRA Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="PRA Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/88/1739892907.png" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">PRA Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PRA Group, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PRAA&rsquo;s Q4 Earnings Whispers</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">However, our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PRA Group this time around. The combination of a positive&nbsp;Earnings ESP&nbsp;and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PRAA has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our&nbsp;Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s see how things have shaped up before the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Q4 Factors to Note for PRA Group</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">PRA Group is expected to have witnessed&nbsp;improved cash collections, higher portfolio income and solid purchasing activity in the fourth quarter. Growing strength in its domestic and European businesses is expected to have benefited its collections. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter <strong>total cash collections</strong> indicates 17.5% year-over-year growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, improved portfolio supply and pricing in the United States&nbsp;are likely to have aided its purchases. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter <strong>portfolio income</strong> is pegged at $228.4 million, indicating a rise of 17.3% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also, the consensus mark for <strong>changes in expected recoveries</strong> currently stands at $39 million, up 71.4% year over year. The company expects legal collection costs in the fourth quarter to be in the low $30 million range. The consensus mark for <strong>other revenues</strong> is pegged at $4.5 million, up 11.4% from a year ago.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The above-mentioned factors are likely to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth. However, total operating expenses are likely to have escalated in the quarter due to increased compensation and employee services, agency fees and other operating expenses, trimming its margins and making an earnings beat uncertain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As the company continues to undertake several initiatives to drive improvement in customer contact rates and expand legal processes, expenses are expected to rise as a result.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How Did Other Stocks Perform?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some other stocks in the broader Finance space that have already reported earnings for this quarter: <strong>Capital One</strong> COF, <strong>Golub Capital BDC, Inc. </strong>GBDC and <strong>Ares Capital </strong><strong>Corporation </strong>ARCC.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Capital One&rsquo;s fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of $3.09 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.66 thanks to higher net interest income and non-interest income and rise in loans and deposits. Also, provisions declined during the quarter. However, the positives were partially offset by increased expenses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Golub Capital reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS of 39 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.3% and declined sequentially from 47 cents. Over the past four quarters, the company beat consensus EPS estimates just once. Total investment income in first-quarter fiscal 2025 of $220.7 million missed the consensus mark by 2.5%. The figure also fell sequentially from $224.4 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ares Capital&rsquo;s fourth-quarter 2024 core earnings of 55 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents due to an increase in expenses. However, an improvement in the total investment income and the company&rsquo;s robust portfolio activities supported the results to some extent.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417538/pra-group-to-report-q4-earnings-what-do-the-estimates-say?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2417538">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Is the New Tesla vs. Ford ETF ELON a Game-Changer for Investors? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 16:55:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Defiance ETFs launched a new ETF &mdash; <strong>Battleshares TSLA vs F ETF</strong> (ELON) &ndash; which seeks to capture the battle between innovation and tradition in the automotive industry. It offers unique investment opportunities and is the first of its kind. It pairs bullish bets on innovative companies with bearish ones on their traditional industry counterparts.</p><h2>ELON in Focus</h2><p>Battleshares TSLA vs. F ETF seeks long-term capital appreciation. It is designed to capitalize on the competitive dynamics within the automobile industry by taking targeted positions in two specific companies, one which the advisor views as a new leader in this industry &mdash;Tesla TSLA &mdash; and one which the advisor views as a legacy leader in this industry &mdash; Ford Motor F (read: Tesla Misses on Q4 Earnings, Vows to Return to Growth: ETFs to Buy).<br /><br />The new ETF employs a unique investment strategy by establishing a leveraged long position in Tesla, offering investors 200% of the stock&#39;s upside while simultaneously holding a short position in Ford, targeting around 100% of the fund&#39;s net assets. This means that ELON will benefit if TSLA&rsquo;s share price outperforms F&rsquo;s share price after considering the effects of leverage.&nbsp;<br /><br />The new ETF comes with a hefty expense ratio of 1.29%.</p><h2>How Will It Fit in a Portfolio?</h2><p>The ETF could be an intriguing choice for investors seeking exposure to the ongoing transformation within the automotive sector, aiming to benefit from the divergence between innovation and tradition. The ETF&#39;s long/short structure is particularly suited for investors who are bullish on Tesla&#39;s growth prospects and bearish on Ford&#39;s performance. This positioning allows potential gains from Tesla&#39;s upward momentum while hedging against potential declines in traditional automakers like Ford.<br /><br />However, it&#39;s essential to recognize that ELON&#39;s leveraged positions amplify both potential gains and losses, introducing a higher level of risk and volatility. Therefore, this ETF may be more appropriate for investors with a higher risk tolerance and a strong conviction in the underlying investment thesis. Additionally, due to its concentrated exposure, ELON should be considered as a complement to a well-diversified portfolio rather than a core holding (read: 5 Leveraged ETFs That Witnessed Double-Digit Gains in January).</p><h2>ETF Competition</h2><p>The concept of pairing long positions in innovative companies with short positions in their traditional counterparts is relatively novel in the ETF space. While there are existing leveraged single-stock ETFs that allow investors to bet on individual companies&#39; stock movements, ELON is among the first to combine two different stocks with opposing directional bets within a single product. This innovative approach sets it apart from traditional ETFs that focus solely on long positions or broader market indices.&nbsp;<br /><br />Defiance ETFs has indicated plans to expand the Battleshares lineup with similar pairings, potentially including matchups like NVIDIA NVDA vs. Intel (INTC), Coinbase COIN vs. Wells Fargo (WFC) and Amazon AMZN vs. Macy&#39;s (M). These forthcoming ETFs aim to provide investors with opportunities to capitalize on competitive market dynamics across various industries.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>The launch of ELON ETF offers a unique investment vehicle for those looking to engage in the evolving competition between disruptive innovators and established industry players.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417520/is-the-new-tesla-vs-ford-etf-elon-a-game-changer-for-investors?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2417520">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vulcan Materials Company</strong> VMC reported stellar fourth-quarter 2024 results, with adjusted earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing on a year-over-year basis.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em><br /><br />The quarterly results reflect strong contributions from the aggregates-led business accompanied by a favorable pricing environment and effective operational execution. These tailwinds supported the company&rsquo;s uptrend and positioned it well for 2025.<br /><br />Moving into 2025, VMC aims to mainly focus on ensuring operational excellence through cost management and improving efficiencies. These efforts, coupled with a favorable pricing scenario, will help it to expand margins and foster top-line growth.<br /><br />VMC&rsquo;s shares gained 4.2% in the pre-market trading session of Tuesday, after the earnings release. The investors&rsquo; sentiment is likely to have been boosted by the company&rsquo;s outlook supported by strong public construction activity and its accretive buyouts.</p><h2>VMC&rsquo;s Q4 Earnings &amp; Revenues</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The quarter&rsquo;s adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.17 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76 by 23.3%. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported an adjusted EPS of $1.46.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="264" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/f5/1739890838.png" title="" width="573" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Vulcan Materials Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Vulcan Materials Company Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues of $1.85 billion also surpassed the consensus mark of $1.83 billion by 1.4% and grew 1.1% year over year.</p><h2>Vulcan&rsquo;s Segments in Detail</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aggregates</strong><br /><br />Revenues from the segment were up year over year to $1.47 billion from $1.41 billion. Aggregates shipments (volumes) declined 3% year over year to 53.9 million tons. Our model expected Aggregates revenues of $1.48 billion on 52 million tons of shipments.<br /><br />Freight-adjusted average sales price rose 11% to $21.41 per ton from the prior-year level. Our estimate for the same was pegged at $21.56 per ton. Freight-adjusted revenues were up 7.8% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s level to $1.15 billion.<br /><br />Gross profit of $486.5 million increased from the prior-year figure of $424.5 million, with the gross margin expanding 300 basis points (bps). Cash gross profit per ton improved 16% to $11.50, driven by favorable pricing and operational efficiencies.<br /><br /><strong>Asphalt and Concrete</strong><br /><br />Revenues in the Asphalt segment were $327.1 million (ahead of our expectation of $309 million), up 9.8% year over year. The segment generated a gross profit of $46.1 million, up 27% from a year ago. Volumes were up slightly to 3.4 million tons from 3.3 million tons a year ago, while the prices improved 7%.<br /><br />Revenues from the Concrete segment were down year over year to $163.5 million (compared with our expectation of $151.5 million) from $256 million. Gross profit totaled $4.6 million, down from $11.4 million in the year-ago period. Shipments fell to 0.9 million cubic yards from 1.5 million cubic yards on a year-over-year basis. The downside was mainly due to the previous third quarter&#39;s inclusion of results from divested concrete assets in Texas. Average selling prices increased to $183.07 from $173.83 in the prior-year quarter.</p><h2>Operating Highlights of VMC</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Selling, administrative and general (SAG) expenses &mdash; as a percentage of total revenues &mdash; contracted 30 bps to 7.5% from a year ago.<br /><br />Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 370 bps year over year to 29.7%.</p><h2>Glimpse of Vulcan&rsquo;s 2024 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For the full year, VMC reported total revenues of $7.42 billion, down from $7.78 billion reported in 2023. Aggregates shipments during the year declined year over year to 219.9 million tons from 234.6 million tons.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s gross profit increased 2.6% year over year to $2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 27.7% from 25.8% reported a year ago.<br /><br />The full-year adjusted EPS increased to $7.53 from $7.00 reported in 2023.</p><h2>VMC&rsquo;s Financials</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, Vulcan&rsquo;s cash and cash equivalents were $559.7 million, down from $931.1 million at 2023-end. Long-term debt was $4.91 billion at December-end, up from the 2023-level of $3.88 billion.<br /><br />As of December-end, total debt to trailing-12-months adjusted EBITDA was 2.6x, up from 1.9x at the end of 2023.<br /><br />In 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.41 billion compared with $1.54 billion a year ago.</p><h2>Vulcan Unveils 2025 Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Under the Aggregates segment, Vulcan expects double-digit year-over-year growth in the cash gross profit per ton compared with $10.61 in 2024. Shipment growth is expected between 3% and 5% year over year. Freight-adjusted price improvement is projected between 5% and 7% (including more than 100 bps of negative mix impact from recent acquisitions). The freight-adjusted unit cash cost is expected to increase in the low to mid-single digits.<br /><br />The total Asphalt and Concrete segment&rsquo;s cash gross profit is expected to be about $360 million compared with $272 million in 2024.<br /><br />Vulcan expects SAG expenses to be between $550 million and $560 million compared with $531 million in 2024. Interest expenses are expected to be approximately $245 million.<br /><br />Adjusted EBITDA for the full year is projected between $2.35 billion and $2.55 billion (including a $150 million contribution from acquisitions) compared with $2.06 billion in 2024.<br />&nbsp;<br />The company expects capital expenditures to be between $750 million and $800 million for maintenance and growth projects. The effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22-23%.</p><h2>VMC&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Vulcan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated</strong> LEG reported fourth-quarter 2024 results, with earnings meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues beating the same. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics declined.<br /><br />The quarterly results indicated weak demand in the company&rsquo;s residential end markets due to a challenging macro environment and soft consumer spending. Softening in Automotive and Hydraulic Cylinders further impacted its performance. Although LEG carried out its restructuring and operating efficiency improvement initiatives, the headwinds mentioned above overshadowed the prospects to a great extent.<br /><br /><strong>Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.</strong> MLM reported mixed results for fourth-quarter 2024, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. Both the top and bottom lines increased on a year-over-year basis.<br /><br />Despite challenges in 2024&mdash;such as bad weather, reduced construction demand and tighter monetary policies&mdash;the company still achieved earnings growth and record profits in the fourth quarter. This was driven by $6 billion in strategic acquisitions and divestitures, reshaping the portfolio to focus more on aggregates, improving margins and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Looking ahead, MLM is confident that strong infrastructure and data center demand will help it meet its 2025 adjusted EBITDA target of $2.25 billion.<br /><br /><strong>Masco Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s MAS fourth-quarter 2024 earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Earnings topped expectations in six of the trailing seven quarters. On the other hand, the net sales missed the consensus mark and tumbled year over year.<br /><br />The quarter&rsquo;s top-line results reflect lower sales volume for North American plumbing products, lower net selling prices of decorative architectural products and an unfavorable sales mix of plumbing products. However, the bottom line was favored by lower selling, general and administrative expenses, favorable net selling prices and strategic cost savings initiatives. Moving into 2025, the company aims to continue maintaining shareholder value through its top-tier repair and remodel-oriented product portfolio, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417519/vulcan-s-q4-earnings-revenues-beat-adjusted-ebitda-margin-up-y-y?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2417519">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Physician services provider&nbsp;<strong>Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.</strong> MD is set to report its fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 20, 2025, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter&rsquo;s earnings and revenues is pegged at 37 cents per share and $485.68 million, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks </em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar</em></strong> <strong><em>to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The earnings estimate for the to-be-reported quarter has remained stable over the past 60 days. The bottom-line projection indicates a year-over-year increase of 15.6%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year decrease of 2.2%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/07/94364.jpg?v=1640106086" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pediatrix Medical&rsquo;s revenues is pegged at $2 billion, implying a marginal rise of 0.1% year over year. The consensus mark for current year EPS is pegged at $1.35, implying a growth of 7.1% on a year-over-year basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Pediatrix Medical beat the consensus estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and met once, with the average surprise being 9.9%, as you can see below.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/5f/1739892401.png" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Pediatrix Medical&rsquo;s Q4 Earnings Whispers</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">However, our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for MD this time around. The combination of a positive&nbsp;Earnings ESP&nbsp;and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MD has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our&nbsp;Earnings ESP Filter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s see how things have shaped up before the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Q4 Factors to Note for Pediatrix Medical</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate for fourth-quarter <strong>net patient service revenue</strong> indicate a 2.2% year-over-year decline. Moreover, both the consensus mark and our model estimate for <strong>hospital contract administrative fees</strong> predict a 2% decline from a year ago. These are likely to have affected the company&rsquo;s top line in the fourth quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for <strong>same-facility revenue growth</strong> is pegged at 4.3% for the fourth quarter thanks to <strong>same-facility patient volume growth</strong> of 1.6% and <strong>same-facility net reimbursement growth</strong> of 2.7%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also, our model estimate for <strong>total operating expenses</strong> predicts a more than 26% year-over-year decline. Lower practice salaries &amp; benefits, practice supplies &amp; other expenses and G&amp;A costs are likely to have aided its bottom line.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our model estimate for fourth-quarter <strong>interest expense</strong> is pegged below $10 million, indicating a continued year-over-year decline in the metric. We expect Pediatrix Medical&rsquo;s fourth-quarter <strong>net income</strong> to be above $22 million, a significant jump from the year-ago period.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How Did Other Stocks Perform?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some stocks in the broader Medical space that have already reported earnings for this quarter: <strong>HCA Healthcare, Inc.</strong>&nbsp;HCA, <strong>The Ensign Group, Inc.</strong> ENSG and <strong>The Cigna Group</strong> CI.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">HCA Healthcare reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted EPS of $6.22, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.2%, driven byhigher patient volumes giving rise to an increased number of inpatient surgeries and same-facility emergency room visits. However, the upside was partly offset by elevated salaries and benefits expenses. Additional expenses due to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton also impacted the results.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ensign reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $1.49, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4% thanks to improved occupancy rates, higher patient days and higher skilled service revenues. The positives were partly offset by an elevated expense level, due to the higher cost of services and rents.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cigna reported fourth-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $6.64, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.2% due to a decline in its overall medical customer base and elevated medical costs. Nevertheless, the downside was partly offset by expanding specialty volumes in the Evernorth Health Services segment and new client wins.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417518/pediatrix-medical-gears-up-for-q4-results-what-to-expect?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2417518">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Here's What to Expect From VICI Properties in Q4 Earnings ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 16:46:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>VICI Properties Inc.</strong> VICI is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings results on Feb. 20, after the closing bell. Its quarterly results are expected to exhibit growth in revenues and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share.</p><p><em><strong>See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</strong></em></p><p>In the last reported quarter, this New York-based experiential REIT, which owns the portfolios of market-leading gaming, hospitality and entertainment destinations, reported an AFFO per share of 57 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.</p><p>Over the preceding four quarters, the company&rsquo;s AFFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions for as many in-line performances, the average surprise being 0.90%. This is depicted in the graph below:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>VICI Properties Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h2> <img alt="VICI Properties Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="299" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/a4/1739891083.png" title="" width="610" /> <p>VICI Properties Inc. price-eps-surprise | VICI Properties Inc. Quote</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Factors to Consider Ahead of VICI&rsquo;s Results</h2><p>VICI Properties owns a geographically diverse portfolio, which includes a mix of gaming, hospitality and entertainment assets that are located across the United States and Canada.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, VICI Properties&#39; performance is expected to have been influenced by the resurgence in demand for its gaming facilities and other hospitality and entertainment venues.</p><p>Further, the company stands to gain from its strong partnerships with top-tier experiential operators. The long-term triple-net leases with these operators are likely to have contributed to stable revenue generation during the quarter, supporting its top-line growth.</p><p>However, high interest expenses during the fourth quarter are likely to have been a spoilsport for VICI Properties.</p><h2>Q4 Projections for VICI</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $974.9 million, which suggests growth of 4.6% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.</p><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from sales-type leases is currently pegged at $525.3 million, which indicates an increase from $518.7 million in the prior quarter and $506.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Income from lease financing receivables and loans stands at $419.7 million, up from $419.1 million in the prior period and $396.8 million in the year-ago period.</p><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from golf operations are estimated at $10.9 million, up from $7.6 million reported in the prior quarter and $10.6 million in the year-ago period.</p><p>The consensus mark for other income currently stands at $19.2 million, implying a decline from $19.3 million from the prior quarter but above the $18.3 million reported in the prior-year period.</p><p>However, the company&rsquo;s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to garner analysts&rsquo; confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly AFFO per share has remained unchanged at 57 cents over the past two months. However, the figure indicates growth of 3.6% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.</p><h2>VICI&rsquo;s 2024 Projections</h2><p>For 2024, VICI Properties estimated AFFO per share in the range of $2.24 and $2.26.</p><p>For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AFFO per share is pegged at $2.26. The figure indicates an 5.1% increase year over year on 6.5% year-over-year growth in revenues to $3.85 billion.</p><h2>What Our Quantitative Model Predicts</h2><p>Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of AFFO per share for VICI Properties this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an AFFO beat, which is not the case here.</p><p>VICI Properties currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><h2>Other Stocks That Warrant a Look</h2><p>Here are two other stocks from the broader REIT sector &mdash; <strong>Host Hotels &amp; Resorts</strong> HST and <strong>Ryman Hospitality Properties</strong> RHP &mdash; that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.</p><p>Host Hotels, slated to release quarterly numbers on Feb. 19, has an Earnings ESP of +1.53% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3 at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p>Ryman Hospitality, scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Feb. 20, has an Earnings ESP of +4.91% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.</p><p>Note: <em>Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417517/here-s-what-to-expect-from-vici-properties-in-q4-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2417517">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ BNY Mellon Stock Hits 52-Week High: Is This the Right Time to Invest? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 16:41:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s BK shares touched a new 52-week high of $88.25 in Friday&rsquo;s trading session. Over the past month, BK stock has gained 5.5%, outperforming the industry, the Zacks Finance Sector and the S&amp;P 500 index. Also, the company&rsquo;s shares have fared better than its close peers, <strong>BankUnited Inc.</strong> BKU and <strong>Northern Trust Corp.</strong> NTRS.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One-Month Price Performance</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/aa/94324.jpg?v=638353772" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Does BK stock have more upside left despite hitting a 52-week high? Let us try to decipher that.</p><h2>Factors to Influence BNY Mellon Stock Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Relatively Higher Rates to Aid Revenues:</strong></em> Though the Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates by 100 basis points since September 2024, the rates are expected to remain higher for longer in light of sticky inflation and geopolitical uncertainties. This will support BK&rsquo;s net interest income (&ldquo;NII&rdquo;) and net interest margin (&ldquo;NIM&rdquo;), driven by higher yields while elevated deposit costs will weigh on it to some extent.<br /><br />BNY Mellon&rsquo;s NII indicated a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2% over the five years ended 2024. Similarly, NIM improved to 1.32% in 2024 from 1.26% in 2023, 0.97% in 2022, 0.68% in 2021 and 0.84% in 2020. Also, total revenues and loans witnessed a CAGR of 2.5% and 5.4%, respectively, over the same period.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Quarterly Revenue Trend</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d9/94325.jpg?v=1699596669" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further, BNY Mellon&rsquo;s product offerings and strategic collaborations are expected to drive revenue growth. Also, a favorable stance of the Trump administration toward businesses and expansionary policies is likely to support fee revenues.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Sales Estimates</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8b/94327.jpg?v=829176744" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the BNY platform&rsquo;s operating model is likely to drive the top line through leveraging technology and boosting fee revenues. This will enable the company to achieve higher operating leverage over time.<br /><br /><em><strong>Strategic Buyouts &amp; Expansion Efforts:</strong></em> BNY Mellon has been trying to expand its presence in international markets through several growth initiatives including launching new services, digitizing operations and making strategic buyouts.<br /><br />In November 2024, the company acquired Archer, while in September, it announced plans to launch Alts Bridge. In 2021, the company, through its subsidiary, acquired Optimal Asset Management. Given the huge growth potential of overseas securities markets and a rise in complex new securities, the long-term growth prospects of the industry are encouraging. In 2024, non-U.S. revenues constituted 35% of total revenues.&nbsp;<br /><br />These initiatives are expected to further strengthen BNY Mellon&rsquo;s footprint globally and boost its international revenues.<br /><br /><em><strong>Solid Balance Sheet Position:</strong></em> As of Dec. 31, 2024, BK&rsquo;s total cash and cash equivalents (consisting of cash and due from banks and interest-earning deposits) were $103.3 billion. Total debt was $54 billion.<br /><br />Additionally, the company maintains investment-grade long-term senior debt ratings of A1, A and AA- from Moody&rsquo;s, the S&amp;P Ratings and Fitch Ratings, respectively. This renders the company favorable access to the debt market. Thus, given its decent earnings strength and a solid liquidity position, BNY Mellon will likely be able to address debt obligations in the near term, even if the economic situation worsens.<br /><br />Moreover, as of Dec. 31, 2024, BK&rsquo;s common equity tier 1 ratio and the total capital ratio of 11.2% and 14.8%, respectively, were well above the regulatory requirements.<br /><br />BNY Mellon&rsquo;s focus on maintaining strong capital and balance sheet positions supports its capital distribution activities. This is demonstrated by the bank&rsquo;s capital distributions of about $4.4 billion through dividends ($1.3 billion) and share repurchases ($3.1 billion) in 2024.<br />&nbsp;<br />After the clearance of the 2024 stress test, the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 12% to 47 cents per share. Further, the company has been consistently raising its quarterly cash dividends. The bank hiked dividends four times during the last five years, with a dividend payout ratio of 31%.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Dividend Yield</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7a/94328.jpg?v=465404255" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Similarly, BKU increased its dividend four times over the past five years, while NTRS raised its dividend only once over the same time frame.<br /><br />Also, BK has a share repurchase plan. In April 2024, the company announced a new share repurchase program worth $6 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2024, roughly $5.33 billion worth of shares remained available for repurchase under the authorization. Management expects to return more or less than 100% earnings this year.<br /><br /><em><strong>Rising Operating Expenses:</strong></em> While BNY Mellon&rsquo;s cost-saving initiatives helped it lower expenses over the past several years, the same has been increasing of late. The company&rsquo;s total non-interest expenses recorded a CAGR of 3.1% over the last five years ended 2024.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Expense Growth Trend</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/bf/94330.jpg?v=557454513" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s multi-year transformation program is expected to result in higher expenses in the quarters ahead. Moreover, given the inflationary pressure and the company&rsquo;s efforts to upgrade operations with updated technology and automation, overall costs are expected to remain elevated.</p><h2>Bullish Analyst Sentiments for BK</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $6.93 and $7.77 per share for 2025 and 2026, respectively, moved marginally upward.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Estimate Revision Trend</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fd/94329.jpg?v=591837650" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The projected figures imply growth of 14.9% and 12.1% for 2025 and 2026, respectively.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><h2>Final Thoughts on BNY Mellon Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Relatively high interest rates, strategic buyouts and a solid balance sheet are likely to support BNY Mellon&rsquo;s financials. Moreover, the Trump administration&rsquo;s expansionary moves will further complement the bank&rsquo;s growth initiatives to boost its top line. However, rising expenses remain a concern. Nonetheless, the company&rsquo;s new operating model will likely drive operating leverage. Thus, BK stock remains a lucrative bet for investors now.<br /><br />BK currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tractor Supply Company</strong> TSCO has been doing well for a while now, recording a gain of 22.8% in a year. TSCO stock has significantly outpaced the Retail - Miscellaneous industry&rsquo;s 2.7% growth. In the same time frame, the broader Retail-Wholesale sector grew 32.5% and the S&amp;P 500 index increased 24.9%.<br /><br />TSCO is focused on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience, given the evolving consumer trends. The company&rsquo;s omnichannel investments bode well. Tractor Supply is reaping the benefits from its Life Out Here Strategy and the Neighbor&rsquo;s Club membership program.</p><h2>Growth Strategies Aid TSCO&rsquo;s Rally</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Tractor Supply&rsquo;s omnichannel investments include curbside pickup, same-day, next-day delivery, a re-launched website and a new mobile app. Management aims at leveraging AI technologies to boost search, redesign checkout and add a new refreshed homepage on personalization. It has been accelerating its digital capabilities.<br /><br />TSCO is significantly enhancing its Neighbor&#39;s Club offering. As the company continues to make investments in the program, it has been seeing strong growth in customer counts and customer retention. Overall, the membership program surpasses 38 million and, as a percentage of sales, touched a record 80%.&nbsp;<br /><br />The major initiatives in the Life Out Here strategy will be TSCO&rsquo;s Project Fusion and Garden Center rollouts. Such projects are progressing well, and hence generating compelling returns through enhanced space productivity. These efforts will be complemented by improved localization capabilities. Moving forward, all the new stores and the fusion remodels will have localized space allocation and assortment depending on their respective archetypes.<br /><br />Tractor Supply has concluded its buyout of Allivet, a privately held online pet pharmacy. The transaction marks a significant strategic move as it expands the company&rsquo;s footprint in the growing pet wellness and animal health sector.&nbsp;<br /><br />Management has also announced a multiyear strategic licensing partnership with Field &amp;Stream. This June, customers can get various hunting and outdoor Field &amp; Stream branded products. All the aforesaid efforts are likely to tap higher sales and boost profitability.</p><h2>TSCO Price Performance</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c6/94331.jpg?v=1116094646" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>TSCO Stock&rsquo;s Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Going by the price/earnings ratio, Tractor Supply stock is currently trading at 25.96 on a forward 12-month basis compared with 17.65 for the industry. The stock is trading higher than its five-year median of 22.88.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c6/94332.jpg?v=21693355" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Bumps in TSCO&rsquo;s Growth Path</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite such growth catalysts, Tractor Supply is reeling under higher selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, including depreciation and amortization, along with the costs related to the opening of distribution centers. Also, cost inflation and a tepid retail sales environment are concerning.&nbsp;<br /><br />The higher SG&amp;A expense has resulted from growth investments, which comprised the increased depreciation, the onboarding of a new distribution center and modest deleveraged fixed costs. Such costs might weigh upon the company&rsquo;s profitability. TSCO anticipates deflation to be a modest headwind in the first half of 2025.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">TSCO has been making cost-saving and other initiatives to bolster growth. Analysts seem quite optimistic about the company.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $15.68 billion and $2.17, respectively. These estimates indicate corresponding growth of 5.4% and 6.4% year over year. For 2026, the consensus mark for sales and EPS is $16.67 billion and $2.41, respectively, indicating a jump of 6.3% and 11.2%, year over year. Tractor Supply currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><h2>Key Picks in Retail</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">We have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely <strong>Deckers </strong>DECK, <strong>Boot Barn </strong>BOOT and <strong>Urban Outfitters</strong> URBN.<br /><br />Deckers, a footwear and accessories dealer, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Deckers&rsquo; current financial-year sales indicates growth of 15.6% from the year-ago figure. DECK delivered an average earnings surprise of 36.8% in the trailing four quarters.<br /><br />Boot Barn, a lifestyle retail chain devoted to western and work-related footwear, apparel and accessories, currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.2%, on average.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boot Barn&rsquo;s current financial-year sales indicates growth of 14.9% from the year-ago figure.<br /><br />Urban Outfitters, a fashion lifestyle specialty retailer, currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. URBN delivered an average earnings surprise of 22.8% in the trailing four quarters.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for Urban Outfitters&rsquo; current financial-year sales indicates growth of 5.7% from the year-ago figure.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417514/tractor-supply-gains-22-8-in-a-year-buy-or-hold-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|price_surge_/_plunge-2417514">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Axsome Q4 Loss Wider Than Expected, Auvelity Drives Sales Growth ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Axsome Therapeutics</strong> AXSM incurred an adjusted loss of 96 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2024, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 90 cents. The company had incurred a loss of 73 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>See the Zacks&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Earnings Calendar&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>to stay ahead of market-making news.</em></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Axsome&rsquo;s total revenues surged 66% year over year to $118.8 million in the fourth quarter, slightly beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $118 million. The year-over-year increase in revenues can be attributed to strong sales of Auvelity (AXS-05).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past year, shares of Axsome have rallied 41.3% against the industry&rsquo;s decline of 8.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/61/94231.jpg?v=1362530831" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">More on AXSM&#39;s Q4 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues in the fourth quarter consisted of product revenues from Auvelity and Sunosi (solriamfetol) and royalty revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Net product revenues were $117.3 million in the quarter compared with $70.7 million reported in the year-ago period. The figure beat our model estimate of $112.2 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Product revenues in the fourth quarter benefited from the strong sales uptake of AXSM&rsquo;s two marketed products, Auvelity for major depressive disorder (MDD) and Sunosi for narcolepsy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Auvelity recorded sales of $92.6 million, up 89% year over year. Sales of the drug beat our model estimate of $87.7 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per Axsome, around 158,000 prescriptions were recorded for Auvelity in the reported quarter, reflecting a sequential increase of 10% and a year-over-year increase of 87%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sunosi&rsquo;s net product sales were $26.2 million, up 16% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level. Total prescriptions for Sunosi in the United States grew 4% sequentially to 49,000.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Axsome acquired U.S. rights to Sunosifrom <strong>Jazz Pharmaceuticals</strong> JAZZ in May 2022. It began selling Sunosi in the U.S. market in May 2022 and in certain international markets in November 2022.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Jazz had received approval for Sunosi as a treatment for narcolepsy in 2019.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Axsome out-licensed its ex-U.S. marketing rights of Sunosi to Pharmanovia in February 2023. JAZZ is entitled to receive high single-digit royalty from AXSM on net sales of Sunosi in the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Royalty revenues totaled $1.4 million in the quarter, reflecting royalties on Sunosi&rsquo;s sales in out-licensed territories.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Research and development expenses (including stock-based compensation) increased to $55 million, up 78.6% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level. The increase was due to higher costs associated with clinical studies, especially the label expansion study of Sunosi as well as other pipeline candidates like AXS-05, AXS-12, AXS-07 and AXS-14.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Selling, general and administrative expenses (including stock-based compensation) totaled $113.3 million, up 30.5% year over year. The increase was due to higher commercial activities for Sunosi and Auvelity and other costs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Dec. 31, 2024, Axsome had cash and cash equivalents worth $315.4 million compared with $327.3 million as of Sept. 30, 2024.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AXSM&#39;s Full-Year Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2024, Axsome generated revenues of $385.7 million, which reflected around 42.5% growth year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the same period, the company reported an adjusted loss of $5.99 per share, wider than a loss of $5.27 in the year-ago period.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Management believes that its cash balance of $315.4 million (as of December-end) is enough to fund future operations into cash flow positivity.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AXSM&#39;s Pipeline Updates &amp; Recent FDA Nod for New Migraine Drug</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Last month, the FDA approved Symbravo (meloxicam and rizatriptan) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. AXSM expects to launch Symbravo in the United States in about four months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The FDA nod for Symbravo should diversify Axsome&rsquo;s commercial drug portfolio and drive growth in future quarters.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also, the phase III EMERGE study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Symbravo for the acute treatment of migraine in adults with a prior inadequate response to an oral CGRP inhibitor. Top-line data from the EMERGE study is expected later in the first quarter of 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, Axsome is evaluating Auvelity in several label expansion studies for other central nervous system disorders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In December 2024, the company announced that the ACCORD-2 study achieved the primary endpoint compared to placebo, while the ADVANCE-2 study did not demonstrate statistical significance for the primary endpoint. Importantly, AXS-05 was safe and well tolerated in both controlled studies. Based on these efficacy and safety results, Axsome plans to submit a new drug application (NDA) for AXS-05 in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease agitation to the FDA in the second half of 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company also plans to start a pivotal phase II/III study of Auvelity for smoking cessation later in 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Other pipeline candidates include AXS-12 and AXS-14, which target multiple central nervous system indications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AXS-12 is currently being developed in three studies for the treatment of narcolepsy. Treatment with AXS-12 demonstrated statistically significant efficacy versus placebo in all three efficacy studies (CONCERT, SYMPHONY, and ENCORE). Based on the data from these studies AXSM plans to submit an NDA for AXS-12 for treating cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy to the FDA in the second half of 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Axsome plans to submit an NDA to the FDA to seek approval of AXS-14 for the treatment of fibromyalgia later in the first quarter of 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company is evaluating Sunosi in separate phase III studies for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), MDD, binge eating disorder (BED) and excessive sleepiness associated with shift work disorder (SWD).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Top-line data from the FOCUS study and the PARADIGM study, evaluating Sunosi for treating ADHD and MDD, respectively, are expected later in the first quarter of 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, top-line data from the ENGAGE&nbsp;study and the SUSTAIN study, evaluating Sunosi for treating BED and SWD in adults, respectively, are expected in 2026.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Berkshire Hathaway </strong>(BRK.B) is expected to witness a decline in its top line when it reports fourth-quarter 2024 results. However, the bottom line is expected to improve.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em><strong>See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.</strong></em><br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BRK.B&rsquo;s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $88.3 billion, indicating 5.4% decline from the year-ago reported figure.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $4.43 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BRK.B&rsquo;s fourth-quarter earnings witnessed no movement in the past 30 days. The estimate suggests a year-over-year increase of 13%.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/38/94353.jpg?v=233963195" style="height: 200px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>BRK.B&rsquo;s Decent Earnings Surprise History</h2><p>Berkshire Hathway&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 45.28%. This is depicted in the following chart.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c7/94352.jpg?v=178798213" style="height: 200px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>What the Zacks Model Unveils for Berkshire Hathaway&nbsp;</h2><p>Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Berkshire this time around. This is because a stock needs to have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case, as you can see below.<br /><br />You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br /><strong>Earnings ESP</strong>: BRK.B has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $4.43.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="262" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/18/1739890596.png" title="" width="538" /> </p><p style="text-align: center;">Berkshire Hathaway Inc. price-eps-surprise | Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Quote</p></div><p><strong>Zacks Rank</strong>: BRK.B currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).&nbsp;<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Factors Likely to Shape BRK.B&rsquo;s Q4 Results</h2><p>Better pricing, solid retention, higher average premiums per auto policy, increased exposure and favorable reserve development are likely to have benefited its insurance business. Continued insurance business growth is expected to have increased float.<br /><br />However, high catastrophe losses are likely to have been a drag on underwriting profitability. The fourth quarter faced the wrath of Hurricane Milton. CoreLogic estimated losses from Hurricane Milton to be about $34 billion, with insured losses between $17 billion to $28 billion. Thus, the combined ratio is likely to have deteriorated.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />GEICO, its private passenger automobile insurance business, is expected to have delivered an improved performance, banking on higher average premiums per auto policy as well as lower claims frequencies, coupled with improved operating efficiencies.<br /><br />Investment results are likely to benefit from higher yields and a larger investment asset base.<br /><br />Unfavorable changes in business mix and lower fuel surcharge revenues are likely to have weighed on the railroad business. However, car/unit volumes are likely to have increased.&nbsp;<br /><br />Earnings of BNSF are likely to reflect higher unit volume, improvements in employee productivity and lower other operating costs. However, higher litigation charges are likely to have been a partial offset.<br /><br />Improved earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities, natural gas pipeline and other energy businesses are likely to have benefited the utilities and energy business. However, lower earnings from the real estate brokerage business are expected to have dampened the upside.<br /><br />Manufacturing, service and retailing businesses are likely to have benefited from higher customer demand for products and services in many businesses.&nbsp;<br /><br />Share buybacks are likely to have provided an additional boost to the bottom line.</p><h2>BRK.B&rsquo;s Price Performance &amp; Valuation</h2><p>The stock outperformed the industry, sector and S&amp;P 500 in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/09/94350.jpg?v=1615789363" style="height: 200px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The stock is trading at a price-to-book value of 1.64X, slightly higher than the industry&rsquo;s 1.63X.

The insurance business is exposed to the vagaries of nature, which induces volatility in the company&rsquo;s underwriting profitability and weighs on its combined ratio. An extremely active 2024 hurricane season with 25 named storms, including 12 hurricanes and six major hurricanes as predicted by the Colorado State University, are likely to have diluted the bottom line of this insurer.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, this company creates tremendous value for shareholders, given its dominant market presence, diverse business activities and, above all, the name Warren Buffett.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Should Investors Do Now With BRK.B Stock?</h2><p>A better-than-expected private passenger automobile insurance business will limit the downside arising from catastrophe losses.&nbsp; Also, better performance from other businesses should offer respite.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, an unfavorable return on capital, a likely decline in the fourth-quarter top line, lowered times interest earned, and contracting margins make the stock vulnerable. The company&rsquo;s exposure to catastrophes tends to make its underwriting results volatile. Notably, insurance operations contribute around one-fourth of Berkshire&rsquo;s top line. Also, given its premium valuation, investors should stay away from the stock for now.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417501/berkshire-hathaway-pre-q4-earnings-analysis-time-to-sell-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2417501">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 5 ETFs to Ride META's Record-Winning Rally ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Facebook&rsquo;s parent company, Meta Platforms META has achieved an unprecedented milestone. The stock soared to an all-time high after having risen for 20 consecutive trading days. META is up 25.8% since the start of the year and a staggering 600% from its 2022 lows. With this gain, the social media giant is the biggest winner among the &ldquo;Magnificent Seven&rdquo; group this year (read: Is Meta Now the Lone Star in the Big Tech Cohort? ETFs in Focus).<br /><br />Given bullish sentiments, investors seeking to tap the growth should invest in ETFs with a large allocation to this social media giant. These include <strong>iShares Global Comm Services ETF</strong> IXP, <strong>Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF</strong> FCOM, <strong>Vanguard Communication Services ETF </strong>VOX, <strong>Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund</strong> XLC and <strong>First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund</strong> FDN.<br /><br />We have highlighted several factors for META&rsquo;s outperformance that are likely to continue this year:<br /><br /><strong>Investments in Artificial Intelligence</strong>: The social media giant will be spending $60-$65 billion in AI infrastructure investments for 2025. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said 2025 will &ldquo;be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and expects Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant.&rdquo;<br /><br />The company is also making a push into AI-powered humanoid robots. Per Bloomberg, Meta is forming a new team within its Reality Labs hardware division to conduct the work.<br /><br /><strong>Expansion into AI Hardware</strong>: Meta is reportedly in discussions to acquire South Korean chip startup FuriosaAI to bolster its AI hardware infrastructure. The move will reduce its reliance on dominant chipmaker NVIDIA (NVDA) and expand the use of its in-house MTIA chips.&nbsp;<br /><br />Advertising Dominance: Meta&#39;s core advertising business continues to thrive, providing a solid foundation for its AI and virtual reality ventures. Currently, Meta holds the second place globally in digital advertising revenues, just behind Alphabet GOOGL (read: META Beats on Q4 Earnings, Plans Big Spending: ETFs in Focus).&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Bullish Analysts</strong>: Wall Street analysts have been largely optimistic about Meta. The stock currently has a Wall Street analyst recommendation of 1.37 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), made by 53 brokerage firms. Of these, 45 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 83.33% and 3.7% of all recommendations. Based on short-term price targets offered by 53 analysts, the average price target for Meta Platforms comes to $738.08, ranging from a low of $505.00 to a high of $900.00.<br /><br /><strong>Cheap Valuation</strong>: At current levels, META trades at 27.63X forward earnings, a discount to the Zacks Internet-Software industry average of 29.86X. As such, it remains one of the cheapest big tech plays.</p><h2>ETFs to Tap</h2><p><strong>iShares Global Comm Services ETF (IXP)&nbsp;</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />iShares Global Comm Services ETF provides global exposure to companies in media, entertainment, social media, search engine, video/gaming and telecommunication services by tracking the S&amp;P Global 1200 Communication Services 4.5/22.5/45 Capped Index. It holds 66 stocks in its basket, with Meta Platforms taking the top spot at 24.9% share. iShares Global Comm Services ETF has amassed $439.3 million in its asset base while trading at an average daily volume of 17,000 shares. The expense ratio is 0.41%. IXP has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook (see: all the Communication ETFs here).<br /><br /><strong>Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF (FCOM)&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF follows the MSCI USA IMI Communication Services 25/50 Index. It holds 109 stocks in its basket, with Meta Platforms occupying the top position at 24.7%. Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF has amassed $1.5 billion in its asset base and trades in an average daily volume of 164,000 shares. It charges 8 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk.<br /><br /><strong>Vanguard Communication Services ETF (VOX)</strong><br /><br />Vanguard Communication Services ETF also targets the communication sector by tracking the MSCI US Investable Market Communication Services 25/50 Index. Holding 117 stocks in its basket, Meta Platform takes the top spot with a 22.6% share. Vanguard Communication Services ETF has AUM of $4.9 billion and trades in a good volume of 184,000 shares a day, on average. It charges 9 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.<br /><br /><strong>Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC)&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund offers exposure to companies from telecommunication services, media, entertainment and interactive media &amp; services and has accumulated $22.4 billion in its asset base. It follows the Communication Services Select Sector Index and holds 22 stocks in its basket, with Meta Platforms occupying the top position at 21.4% share. Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund charges 8 bps in annual fees and trades in an average daily volume of 4.5 million shares. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (read: How Will Big Tech ETFs Be Impacted by Trump Tariffs?).<br /><br /><strong>First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN)</strong><br /><br />First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund follows the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index, giving investors exposure to the broad Internet industry. It holds about 40 stocks in its basket, with Meta Platform occupying the top spot at 11.3%. First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund is the most popular and liquid ETF in the broad technology space, with AUM of $7.4 billion and an average daily volume of around 398,000 shares.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>OppFi Inc.</strong> OPFI shares have skyrocketed 194.6% in the past six months, outperforming the 26.1% rally of its industry and the 9.7% rise in the Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Six Months&#39; Price Performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6f/94346.jpg?v=1260759619" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, indicating bullish sentiment among investors.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Stock Trades Above 50-Day SMA</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/52/94348.jpg?v=1199492873" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">OPFI&rsquo;s performance significantly surpasses its close competitors, <strong>CompoSecure, Inc. </strong>CMPO and <strong>PAR Technology Corporation</strong> PAR. CMPO and PAR shares have gained 38.4% and 25.5% in the past six months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the rise in OppFi&rsquo;s shares, buying it could be an obvious move. However, the crucial question we should ask is whether now is the right time to invest in OPFI. Let us analyze and find out the right move.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">OPFI Gains From Bridging the Gap for Underbanked Customers</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Since the pandemic, there has been a significant rise in demand for digital banks, which are more customer-friendly and serve historically underserved banking consumers (subprime and non-prime customers). These customers provide a considerable credit opportunity and are the primary target of multiple neo-banks. Per OppFi, there are nearly 60 million U.S. consumers who are credit marginalized. This shows the large market opportunity that the company can cash in on.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest problem faced by customers is living paycheck to paycheck while trying to enhance their credit score. Traditionally, financing options for these customers have been limited, with high interest rates and poor customer service. In that context, OPFI can underwrite riskier loans while charging less than traditional financial institutions, thereby serving a large part of underbanked customers.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">OPFI Stock Looks Undervalued</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">OppFi shares look cheap and appealing to investors. It is priced at 13.1 times forward 12-month earnings per share, which is lower than the industry&rsquo;s average of 25.8 times.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When looking at the trailing 12-month EV-to-EBITDA ratio, OPFI is trading at 10.1 times, below the industry&rsquo;s average of 14.8 times.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">OppFi&rsquo;s Liquidity Position Beats Industry</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the third quarter of 2024, OPFI&rsquo;s current ratio of 1.53 outperformed the industry average of 1.24 and increased 4.8% from the year-ago quarter. A current ratio of more than 1 suggests that the company will be able to pay off its short-term obligations easily.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ab/94347.jpg?v=1985568576" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">OPFI&rsquo;s Strong Top &amp; Bottom-Line Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for OppFi&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 revenues is pegged at $520 million and 547.1 million, implying 2.2% and 5.2% year-over-year growth, respectively. The consensus estimate for OPFI&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings per share stands at 86 cents and $1, suggesting 68.6% and 16.3% year-over-year increases, respectively.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">OppFi&rsquo;s Consumer Credit Risk</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">OPFI&rsquo;s ability to underwrite riskier loans to serve underbanked customers can acts towards its detriment. If the creditworthiness of consumers deteriorates, the company might have to deal with an increase in charge-offs, thus affecting its bottom line. In a competitive market, consumers will have a rising number of alternative credit platforms to use, resulting in increasing pricing pressure on the neo-banks.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">OPFI&rsquo;s Bet on Bitty Seems Risky</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2024, OppFi announced its acquisition of a 35% equity interest in Bitty Advance, encompassing its servicing business. OPFI was excited about this buyout as management believed that Bitty would serve as a cornerstone for OPFI&rsquo;s expansion into a new vertical in small business financing. However, the inherent difficulties of scaling a small business lending platform, coupled with a huge target market, present potential problems.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While the acquired company has shown profitability in the past, hitting the substantial growth mark and seamless integration with OppFi&rsquo;s platform may require extensive capital and extended time. The yardstick of success in terms of diversification is the realization of expected accretive benefits. Bitty&rsquo;s failure to meet the standards or the detriment in economic conditions can result in a contraction of the small business lending market, and OPFI&rsquo;s plan to benefit from diversification and expansion could be compromised.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Analyzing the Right Entry Point for OPFI</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A significantly large market of underbanked customers, coupled with a robust liquidity position, benefits OppFi. Healthy top and bottom-line views are promising. A cheaper valuation makes the stock favorable for investing in the long run.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, considering the heightened exposure to credit risks from underwriting riskier loans and the probability of failing diversification and expansion, it is prudent to retain the stock in your portfolio.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">OppFi carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417497/oppfi-stock-skyrockets-195-in-6-months-how-should-investors-play?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2417497">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

This upward trend is likely to have extended and supported revenue expansion in the to-be-reported quarter.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s expanded cloud platform incorporates key factors for sustained growth, led by its broadened cloud services portfolio. Its notable additions include offerings like Soperator and Managed PostgreSQL for IK8S, which are designed to enhance scalability, flexibility, and performance. These innovations are expected to have strengthened the company&rsquo;s competitive position.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">NBIS&rsquo; Liquidity Improves in 2024</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In December 2024, the company secured $700 million in equity financing from prominent investors, including NVIDIA, Accel and Orbis Investment Management, to accelerate the rollout of its full-stack AI infrastructure. This funding supports the company&#39;s focus on advanced AI capabilities, highlighted by the launch of a specialized cloud platform for AI in the early fourth quarter, built on the NVIDIA accelerated computing framework. This initiative is anticipated to have enhanced the company&#39;s competitive edge and driven growth in the fast-evolving AI market.<br /><br />Nebius Group plans to accelerate investments in GPU procurement and data center capacity expansion to support its business growth. With capital expenditure in the fourth quarter expected to surpass the $387.6 million spent in the first nine months of 2024, these increased investments are likely to have impacted NBIS&#39;s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, affecting profitability.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What Our Model Says</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the exact case here.<br /><br />NBIS currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some companies worth considering, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:<br /><br /><strong>Autohome</strong> ATHM has an Earnings ESP of +7.27% and a Zacks Rank of 2 at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong><br /><br />ATHM shares have gained 15.9% year to date. Autohome is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Feb. 20.<br /><br /><strong>Marvell Technology</strong> MRVL currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.77% and a Zacks Rank #2.<br /><br />MRVL shares have declined 3.6% year to date. Marvell Technology is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results on March 05.<br /><br /><strong>Bumble</strong> BMBL presently has an Earnings ESP of +40.97% and a Zacks Rank #3.<br /><br />BMBL shares have returned 3.9% year to date. Bumble is set to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 18.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417480/nebius-group-gears-up-to-report-q4-earnings-what-s-in-the-offing?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2417480">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ MasTec Slips 12% in a Month: How Should Investors Play the Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 15:49:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>MasTec, Inc.</strong> MTZ has lost 12.4% over the past month, reflecting the broader industry trend, as the Zacks Building Products - Heavy Construction industry has fallen 12.6% during the same period. Meanwhile, the Zacks Construction sector declined 4.5%, while the overall market, represented by the Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite, has risen 1.8%.<br /><br />The stock decline comes amid industry-wide concerns as construction businesses assess the potential impacts of policy changes proposed by President Donald Trump. Additionally, a slower recovery in demand for distribution services due to deferred customer spending and delays in certain transmission projects have affected MasTec&rsquo;s performance.<br /><br />The broader industry weakness is evident as other major players have also recorded declines during the same period. <strong>AECOM </strong>ACM has dropped 7.8%, and <strong>Fluor Corporation</strong> FLR and <strong>EMCOR Group, Inc. </strong>EME have declined 13.8% and 15.8%, respectively. This trend highlights the broader challenges impacting the heavy construction industry.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">MTZ Stock&rsquo;s Past Month&rsquo;s Price Performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/11/94342.jpg?v=1457870644" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Technical Indicators: Mixed Signals</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ff/94343.jpg?v=180950454" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MasTec&rsquo;s stock is trading above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), indicating solid long-term momentum. However, it is below its 50-day SMA, reflecting near-term volatility.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MTZ Trades at a Premium</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MasTec&#39;s valuation remains a concern. The stock is trading at a forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio (P/E F12M) of 24.89&mdash;higher than the Zacks Building Products - Heavy Construction industry average of 17.32 and well above its three-year median of 19.9.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/13/94344.jpg?v=1145781713" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While MasTec&#39;s higher valuation reflects its growth potential, investors may hesitate to buy at these levels, especially given the recent price decline.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MasTec&rsquo;s Positive Underlying Factors</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MTZ&rsquo;s diversified business model, coupled with strong market demand, positions the company well for continued growth across its key segments. The company benefits from a solid backlog, driven by increasing customer demand for services in areas such as Clean Energy &amp; Infrastructure, Power Delivery, and Communications.<br /><br />As of Sept. 30, 2024, MasTec reported an 18-month backlog of $13.86 billion, marking a 3.9% sequential rise and an 11% increase from the prior year. This record-high backlog strengthens the company&rsquo;s momentum heading into 2025, offering clear visibility into upcoming projects that will drive its performance.<br /><br />MTZ&rsquo;s Communications segment is seeing robust growth, fueled by expanding market opportunities and a rising demand for advanced network infrastructure. The company is witnessing strong demand in its wireline segment, with ongoing advancements in the Nokia Ericsson swap-out and increased market share with AT&amp;T.<br /><br />Although there are some temporary delays, the combination of Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment funding, and the growing demand for fiber, driven by artificial intelligence and data centers, is expected to fuel significant growth. The wireless sector continues to benefit from these positive developments.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MTZ&rsquo;s Strong Financial Management</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MasTec has shown solid financial discipline by focusing on cash flow generation and effective capital allocation. Since its 2022 acquisition, the company has been actively reducing debt, paying off more than $900 million through the third quarter of 2024.<br /><br />One of the company&rsquo;s key strengths has been its impressive cash flow conversion, with about 85% of adjusted EBITDA turned into cash flow. With expectations to reach a year-end leverage ratio in the low 2X range, MasTec is improving its financial flexibility and strengthening its overall position.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MasTec Capitalizes on Infrastructure Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MTZ is poised to capitalize on growth in infrastructure spending, driven by government initiatives such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. The company&rsquo;s focus on clean energy, power delivery and water infrastructure aligns well with these expanding investments. As government spending increases, MasTec&rsquo;s long-term growth opportunities are strengthened.<br /><br />For 2025, the company anticipates continued growth across its key segments, including communications, power delivery and clean energy. MasTec expects double-digit revenue growth in these areas, with margin improvements from that reported in 2024. In power delivery, the company expects strong revenue growth as large transmission projects ramp up. These positive trends are expected to continue in 2025 and beyond, supporting MTZ&rsquo;s long-term growth prospects.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Positive Fundamentals</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company demonstrates solid fundamentals, with a strong VGM Score of A, supported by an impressive Value Score of B, alongside Growth and Momentum Scores of A and B, respectively.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MasTec&rsquo;s EPS Estimates &amp; Analyst Sentiment</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about MasTec&rsquo;s earnings potential. Over the past 30 days, earnings estimates for 2025 have been revised upward, as shown below, indicating 47.4% year-over-year growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/e2/94345.jpg?v=12369496" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion: Is MTZ Stock a Buy, Hold, or Sell?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MasTec has experienced a decline over the past month, reflecting broader industry challenges and deferred customer spending. However, the company&rsquo;s solid backlog, strong financial management and focus on high-growth sectors like clean energy and communications provide a strong foundation for growth.<br /><br />With a favorable VGM score of A and positive earnings estimate revisions for 2025, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock shows promising long-term potential. While it may be prudent for investors to monitor the stock for further developments, those already holding the stock can consider maintaining their position, given its long-term growth potential and solid financial position.<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417479/mastec-slips-12-in-a-month-how-should-investors-play-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2417479">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Will Protective Segment's Low Demand Hurt Sealed Air's Q4 Earnings? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sealed Air Corporation</strong> SEE is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 25, before the opening bell.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SEE&rsquo;s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.37 billion, indicating a 0.9% decline from the year-ago reported figure.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for earnings is pinned at 67 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SEE&rsquo;s fourth-quarter earnings has moved down 1.5% in the past 60 days. The estimate indicates a year-over-year decline of 23.9%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8d/94337.jpg?v=627243126" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">SEE&rsquo;s Solid Earnings Surprise History</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Sealed Air&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 34.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8d/94337.jpg?v=1972412169" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What the Zacks Model Indicates for Sealed Air</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Sealed Air this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here.<br /><br /><strong>Earnings ESP</strong>: Sealed Air has an Earnings ESP of -1.49%. You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank</strong>: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell).</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Likely to Have Shaped SEE&rsquo;s Q4 Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Sealed Air&rsquo;s Protective segment experienced lower volumes for 11 consecutive quarters. The company expected the weakness to persist throughout 2024 and continue in 2025. For the Protective segment, our model indicates a year-over-year volume decline of 5% for the fourth quarter.<br /><br />After witnessing lower volumes for seven quarters, the Food segment volume returned to growth in the first quarter of 2024, driven by solid demand for bags, case-ready and automated solutions. The impacts of the same are expected to get reflected in the fourth-quarter results. Volumes for the segments are also likely to have benefited from the demand for automated equipment and sustainable packaging solutions. Our model projects the Food segment&rsquo;s volumes to rise 4.8% year over year in the fourth quarter.<br /><br />Nonetheless, higher volumes in the segment are likely to have been offset by continued weakness in the Protective segment in 2024.<br /><br />Our model estimate for the Food segment&rsquo;s fourth-quarter net sales is pegged at $912 million, suggesting growth of 2.2% from the prior-year period&rsquo;s reported figure. The impacts of pricing (negative 2.1%) are likely to have offset the gains from higher volumes. Our estimate for the segment&rsquo;s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) stands at $196 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 0.4%.<br /><br />Our estimate for the Protective segment&rsquo;s fourth-quarter net sales is $445 million, implying a year-over-year dip of 8.2% due to the volume decline and pricing impacts of negative 3.2%. Our estimate for the segment&rsquo;s adjusted EBITDA is pegged at $75 million, suggesting a year-over-year decrease of 17.1%.<br /><br />Sealed Air&rsquo;s overall volumes are expected to rise 1.4%, per our model. We expect pricing impacts of 2.5% for the quarter.<br /><br />Savings from the company&rsquo;s Reinvent SEE Strategy have been driving productivity gains and mitigating supply-chain challenges. This is expected to have driven the operating margin performance in the December-ended quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Sealed Air&rsquo;s Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past year, SEE shares have lost 3.6% against the industry&rsquo;s 15.5% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/28/94336.jpg?v=103391179" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some stocks with the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.<br /><br /><strong>Trimble Inc.</strong> TRMB, which presently has a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +1.81%, is expected to report fourth-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 19. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TRMB&rsquo;s earnings for the quarter is pegged at 88 cents per share, indicating 39.7% year-over-year growth. It has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 9.7%.<br /><br /><strong>Osisko Gold Royalties</strong> OR, which currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +7.15%, is expected to report fourth-quarter 2024 results soon.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for OR&rsquo;s earnings for the quarter is pegged at 16 cents per share, indicating 33% year-over-year growth. It has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 6.6%.<br /><br /><strong>Greif, Inc.</strong> GEF has an Earnings ESP of +2.60% and a Zacks Rank of 3 at present. The company is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Feb. 26.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GEF&rsquo;s earnings for the quarter is pegged at 72 cents per share, implying a 43.3% year-over-year dip. It has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 133.5%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417476/will-protective-segment-s-low-demand-hurt-sealed-air-s-q4-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2417476">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Empire State Manufacturing Increase More Than Expected ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <h2 style="text-align: justify;">Economic &amp; Earnings Commentary</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Pre-market futures are starting a new holiday-shortened trading week higher, with all four major indexes currently riding in the green. The Dow is +81 points at this hour, the S&amp;P 500 is +23, the Nasdaq +96 points and the small-cap Russell 2000 +9. All four are also up over the past five trading days, and all but the Russell are up over the past month.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Empire State Manufacturing Surprises to the Upside</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Monthly manufacturing data from the <strong>Empire State</strong> survey swings to a positive this morning, +5.7 versus -1.0 expected, for the fifth positive month in the past seven. This is a nice bounce-back from the unrevised -12.6 reported for January. November had the strongest monthly number in the past year, +20.2; April had the weakest: -19.4.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Homebuilder Confidence Index After the Open</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Later this morning, the <strong>Homebuilder Confidence</strong> survey for February hits the tape. It&rsquo;s expected to tick down to 46 from 47 reported the prior month, which was the strongest since April of last year. August was the low point of the past 12 months, at 39. Considering that mortgage rates are not expected to sink down to more comfortable levels in the near term, we&rsquo;d have to say homebuilder confidence is hanging in there. We&rsquo;ll see what the results are today.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Reports This Morning: MDT, BIDU</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MedTech giant <strong>Medtronic</strong> MDT beat earnings estimates in its fiscal Q3 report this morning by 3 cents to $1.39 per share, while revenues in the quarter slightly missed expectations to $8.29 billion. As a result, shares are selling off by -4.8% at this hour, pulling back some of the +16% gains year to date. For some perspective, however, Medtronic revenue still came in notably higher than the $8.09 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Basically the Chinese equivalent to Google, <strong>Baidu</strong> BIDU also reported earnings this morning, outperforming estimates on both top and bottom lines in its Q4 report. Earnings of $2.63 per American Depositary Share (ADS) easily swept past the $1.78 in the Zacks consensus. Revenues of $4.68 billion were solidly ahead of the $4.56 billion expected. But concerns about ad revenues missing estimates are sending shares down -4%, dialing back some of the +15.6% in gains year to date.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What to Expect from This Trading Week</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Compared with the past two weeks &mdash; which brought us Jobs numbers and Inflation Rates, as well as earnings reports from marquee names &mdash; we&rsquo;re a little quieter here in this holiday-shortened trading week. Among those touchstones we can look forward to are Housing Starts and Building Permits, minutes from the January Fed meeting, Philly Fed manufacturing data, and S&amp;P flash Services and Manufacturing PMI.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of earnings season, we embark on the final leg of calendar Q4 earnings this week. We know this when we start to see the major big-box retailers like <strong>Walmart</strong> WMT report, which it will ahead of the opening bell on Thursday. Earnings season does not signal its end, however, until <strong>NVIDIA</strong> NVDA reports, and that&rsquo;s not until a week from tomorrow.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417475/empire-state-manufacturing-increase-more-than-expected?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-economic_highlights-2417475">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>NetSol Technologies, Inc.</strong> NTWK have declined 9.3% since the company reported earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. This compares against the S&amp;P 500 index&rsquo;s 1.1% rise over the same time frame. Over the past month, the stock has lost 7.2% compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 1.9% growth.</p><h2>Revenue &amp; Earnings Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, NetSol reported total net revenues of $15.5 million, a 2% year-over-year increase from $15.2 million. Growth was primarily driven by a 27% increase in subscription and support revenues, which reached $8.6 million. However, license fees dropped sharply to $73,000 from $3 million in the prior-year quarter. Service revenues saw a robust 26% increase to $6.8 million from $5.4 million in the same period last year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite revenue growth, profitability metrics declined. The company reported a GAAP net loss of $1.1 million, or 10 cents per diluted share, against a net income of $408,000, or 4 cents per diluted share, in the prior-year period. This decline was partially influenced by a $698,000 loss on foreign currency exchange transactions. The gross margin declined slightly to 45% from 47% a year ago, while operating expenses rose to 48% of sales from 40%, reflecting increased investment in sales, marketing and AI initiatives.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>NetSol Technologies Inc.

Quote</p></div><h2>Recurring Revenue Growth &amp; Strategic Investments</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A key highlight of the quarter was the continued expansion of NetSol&rsquo;s recurring revenue base. Subscription and support revenues accounted for 56% of total sales compared with 45% in the previous year. Notably, the quarter included a one-time revenue catch-up of $1 million; excluding this, subscription and support revenue growth would have been 12%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NetSol is also ramping up investments in AI-driven solutions. The company launched &quot;Transcend AI Labs&quot; to integrate artificial intelligence across its products and services. AI-powered enhancements, such as Intelligent Document Processing and an interactive AI assistant, aim to improve efficiency, automate compliance and enhance customer interactions.</p><h2>Market Expansion &amp; Key Customer Agreements</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">NetSol is seeing increased traction with its Transcend Retail platform. The platform, already in use by MINI Anywhere USA, is now being integrated with BMW USA, expanding its reach beyond the MINI dealership network.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Internationally, NetSol secured a multi-million-dollar expansion agreement with a long-standing customer in China and expanded an existing deal with a leading Japanese equipment finance company. The company also highlighted the growing demand for its products in the United States, Europe and the Asia-Pacific.</p><h2>Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Position</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company ended the quarter with $21.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from $19.1 million as of June 30, 2024. Working capital stood at $23 million, slightly lower than $23.6 million six months earlier. Shareholders&rsquo; equity totaled $33.9 million, or $2.91 per share.</p><h2>Other Developments</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">NetSol&rsquo;s subsidiary, NetSol Pakistan, approved a buyback of 10 million shares, aiming to increase the parent company&rsquo;s ownership in the subsidiary by approximately 10%. As of the earnings call, 2.4 million shares had already been repurchased for $1.3 million.</p><h2>Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Management remains optimistic about long-term growth, emphasizing its focus on recurring revenue expansion and AI-driven product enhancements. However, near-term profitability remains under pressure due to increased investments and fluctuations in license revenues. The company believes these strategic initiatives will lead to greater revenue predictability and sustainable profitability in the future.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2417474/netsol-incurs-loss-in-q2-despite-reporting-y-y-revenue-growth?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-microcap_article-2417474">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Company</strong> ANF stock has rolled down 25% in the year-to-date period, marking a significant underperformance from the broader industry&rsquo;s 5.7% decline. The stock&rsquo;s dismal performance has also underperformed the Retail-Wholesale sector&rsquo;s rally of 3.9% and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s growth of 9.2%.<br /><br />The ANF stock also shows a remarkable downside against its industry peers like <strong>Genesco </strong>GCO, <strong>American Eagle</strong> AEO and <strong>Boot Barn</strong>&rsquo;s BOOT growth of 4.3%, 13.8%, and 9.6%, respectively, in the year-to-date period.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">ANF&rsquo;s Stock Performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/19/94301.jpg?v=1579316840" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the current price of $112.07, the ANF stock trades at a discount of 43.1% to its 52-week high of $196.99. The current stock price reflects a 5.6% premium from its 52-week low mark. ANF trades below its 50 and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish sentiment.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Abercrombie Stock Trades Below 50-Day &amp; 200-Day Moving Averages</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/cb/94304.jpg?v=1665873970" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>What&rsquo;s Hindering ANF&rsquo;s Stock Performance?</h2><p>Abercrombie has been experiencing strong sales growth across each of its brands. The company has seen customers responding to its product and experiencing growth across regions and brands. Management has been making investments in the Abercrombie digital experience as well. The Hollister team remains committed to expanding its reach within the teen market.<br /><br />Abercrombie is working toward rationalizing its store base by reducing its dependence on underperforming tourist-driven locations. As part of its store-optimization plans, the company intends to reposition larger-format flagship locations as smaller omnichannel-enabled ones.</p><h2>ANF&rsquo;s Upbeat Forward Outlook Reflects Strength</h2><p>In January 2025, Abercrombie provided a positive business update, thanks to a robust performance in the holiday season. The company noted that its fiscal fourth-quarter through holiday season performance was ahead of management&rsquo;s expectations issued in November.<br /><br />Net sales growth for the period was driven by comparable sales (comps) across regions and brands in the holiday selling period. This is backed by the positive response to its exciting product assortments and engaging marketing.<br /><br />Driven by a stellar holiday performance, management hiked the sales view for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 while reiterating the outlook for the other metrics. Robust customer-driven brands, relevant brand playbooks, major global growth opportunities leveraging capabilities in owned and operated channels, and a solid omnichannel base, coupled with a healthy balance sheet and a consistent free cash flow, are likely to boost growth.<br /><br />Management expects fiscal fourth-quarter net sales growth of 7-8%, an uptick from the previously mentioned 5-7%. The operating margin for the fiscal fourth quarter is projected to be 16%. This guidance does not include the impacts of 550 basis points from the 53rd week and about 50 basis points from foreign currency. The company retained its operating margin view of 16% and the effective tax rate guidance in the high 20s for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.<br /><br />For fiscal 2024, Abercrombie anticipates net sales growth of 15% compared with the previously mentioned 14-15%. Management expects an operating margin of 15% and an effective tax rate in the mid-20s in fiscal 2024. The sales outlook excludes the impacts of 120 basis points from the 53rd week.</p><h2>Abercrombie&rsquo;s Estimates Indicate Downtrend</h2><p>Despite the raised sales guidance and a robust holiday period, the company&rsquo;s sales projection still falls short year over year. This has been hurting investors&rsquo; sentiments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Abercrombie&rsquo;s fiscal 2024 has been unchanged in the past 30 days. The consensus estimate for fiscal 2025 EPS decreased 0.3% in the past 30 days.<br /><br />For fiscal 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ANF&rsquo;s sales and EPS implies 15.1% and 69.4% year-over-year growth, respectively. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 sales and earnings indicates 5.8% and 5.5% year-over-year growth, respectively.<br /><br /><em><strong>Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8f/94302.jpg?v=2024720158" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Undervalued Stock: Is It an Opportune Time to Buy?</h2><p>From a valuation perspective, ANF shares present an attractive opportunity, trading at a discount than historical and industry benchmarks. The recent pullback has brought Abercrombie&#39;s stock valuation to a more affordable and appealing level.<br /><br />The stock trades at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9.98X, reflecting a discount to the broader industry&rsquo;s 19.24X multiple and its three-year high of 121.44X. It stands below the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s average of 22.67X.<br /><br />Trading much below its three-year high and industry peers, the current valuation appears more affordable and appealing, presenting an opportunity to accumulate shares. The stock&rsquo;s current Value Score of A further validates its appeal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/45/94303.jpg?v=1791964385" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Is It Wise to Buy ANF Stock on This Dip?</h2><p>Abercrombie&#39;s growth is bolstered by its ability to capitalize on favorable fashion trends, digital initiatives and strong strategies like store optimization. The company&rsquo;s solid fundamentals highlight its financial strength and operational efficiency. Its transformation efforts, including rebranding, digital expansion and store enhancements, position it for sustained long-term growth. These factors make the ANF stock an attractive investment option.<br /><br />Despite the recent surge in its share price, this profitable apparel retailer remains a bargain due to its relatively low valuation compared with peers. Abercrombie currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
