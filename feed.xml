<![CDATA[ <h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Nvidia Beats Wall Street Estimates</strong></span></span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Despite sky-high expectations, <strong>Nvidia (</strong></span></span>NVDA<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>),</strong> the world&rsquo;s leading chip maker and the second-largest U.S. company, exceeded Wall Street Expectations. Revenue exploded to $30.05 billion versus $13.51 billion year-over-year, trouncing estimates of $28.86 billion. Data center revenue soared to $26.3 billion versus $10.32 billion in the 2023 quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock reported adjusted EPS of $0.68, beating Zacks Consensus Estimates for a seventh straight quarter.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/aa/75838.jpg?v=551306507" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Per usual, Nvidia laid out a rosy outlook for the future, again upping guidance. However, the quarter was mixed due to a delay in the company&rsquo;s latest chip (named Blackwell) and a margin slowdown. Read below for more details.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Blackwell Update</strong></span></span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Gene Munster (@munster_gene), Managing Partner at Deepwater Asset Management, made an astute observation following Nvidia&rsquo;s earnings release:</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><em>&ldquo;NVDA first take: the guidance is much better than investors&rsquo; first take (stock down). The company guided revenue up ~3% in October, which includes the negative impact of what appears to be a 2&ndash;3-month Blackwell delay. In other words, if there was no delay, the guidance would have been measurably higher. Keep in mind the October quarter will also face strong &ldquo;Osborne Effect&rdquo; headwinds as some customers delay purchasing in anticipation of Blackwell.&rdquo;</em></strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&ldquo;The Osborne Effect&rdquo; describes the drop or slow down in sales that can happen when a company announces a new product too early, causing customers to hold off on buying the current offering and opting to wait for the new one to be released. The term was coined in the 1980s when Osborne Computer Corporation unveiled a new model to replace their current one, which led to a significant decline in sales for the existing version and ultimately played a role in the company&rsquo;s bankruptcy.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While Nvidia is far from seeing a similar fate, Blackwell, Nvidia&rsquo;s newest and most sophisticated chip, was set to ship in 2024 until there was an issue with the company&rsquo;s supplier, <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor (</strong></span></span>TSM<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>).</strong> <strong>As I discussed in my Nvidia EPS preview,</strong> the status of Blackwell would be a critical factor to watch this quarter. The good news for investors is that management largely quelled concerns, saying, <strong><em>&ldquo;We shipped customer samples of our Blackwell architecture in the second quarter. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mask to improve production yield. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026. In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper demand is strong, and shipments are expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025.&rdquo;</em></strong></span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Nvidia Announces $50 Billion Buyback Program</strong></span></span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Nvidia is looking to put some of its massive cash hoard to work with a $50 billion buyback.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6c/75840.jpg?v=386286733" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Share buybacks, like the one seen in <strong>Apple (</strong></span></span>AAPL<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>),</strong> can be bullish because they limit the shares outstanding, drive EPS, and reinforce management&rsquo;s confidence in the company&rsquo;s future.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Nvidia&rsquo;s Net Profit Margin Shrinks</strong></span></span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Nvidia&rsquo;s net profit margins decreased to 55% from a record 57% in Q1, marking it&rsquo;s first profit margin decline in two years. The NVDA CFO explained, <strong><em>&ldquo;Q2 gross margins were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material and may continue to be impacted in the future.&rdquo;</em></strong></span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b8/75839.png?v=409675762" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Charlie Bilello, Creative Planning</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">I believe this is the one major concern moving forward for NVDA. Demand clearly remains insatiable. However, a sustained slowdown in margins could take some wind out of the stock&rsquo;s sails. Increased competition from <strong>Advanced Micro Devices (</strong></span></span>AMD<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>)</strong> is another potential threat to NVDA&rsquo;s dominance. Nonetheless, one quarter does not make a trend.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Nvidia again smashed Wall Street expectations and provided a rosy outlook. Meanwhile, the delay in the company&rsquo;s highly-anticipated Blackwell chip seems to be a minor hiccup. That said, NVDA longs must monitor profit margins in the coming quarters.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2328610/nvidia-q2-eps-review-blackwell-update-buyback-margins?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-investment_ideas-2328610">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Nvidia Earnings: A Quick Summary ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 23:36:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Nvidia NVDA, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited company for the Q2 earnings season, has finally delivered its results. So far, shares have faced an adverse reaction, down in after-hours trading.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at what the company delivered.</p><h2><strong>Nvidia Reports Record Sales</strong></h2><p>The AI favorite generated record quarterly sales of $30 billion, reflecting a 15% sequential jump from Q1 and an even more impressive 122% year-over-year climb. The company&rsquo;s sales growth has been remarkable, with this period&rsquo;s results penciling in the fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit percentage year-over-year top-line growth.</p><p>Of course, Data Center results were the true focal point of the release, which again delivered in a big way. Data Center sales reached a quarterly record of $26.3 billion, up 16% sequentially from Q1 and 154% on a year-over-year stack.</p><p>Jensen Huang was unsurprisingly bullish on the Data Center, stating, <em>&lsquo;Hopper demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.&rsquo;</em></p><p>He continued, <em>&lsquo;NVIDIA achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI.&rsquo;</em></p><p>Though its gross margin did fall sequentially, the 75.7% print reflected continued margin expansion relative to the year-ago period.</p><p>Nvidia&rsquo;s gaming results are also a key area that investors should keep a close eye on in future periods, particularly as AI PCs continue to gain steam. Gaming revenue reached $2.9 billion, reflecting a nice 16% year-over-year climb from the year-ago period.</p><p>Concerning the outlook for Q3, Nvidia expects sales of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75.0%, respectively.</p><h2><strong>Should You Buy Nvidia Shares?</strong></h2><p>Nvidia NVDA has finally delivered its Q2 results, with the reaction post-earnings negative so far despite posting another record-breaking release that re-confirmed robust demand. The stock remains a prime selection for those seeking AI exposure, and short-term price movements should be ignored by those with a long investing horizon.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328611/nvidia-earnings-a-quick-summary?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-stocks_in_the_news-2328611">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Phibro Animal Health (PAHC) Beats Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 22:20:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Phibro Animal Health (PAHC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.41 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.34 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.38 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.</p><p>This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 20.59%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of animal health products and nutritional supplements would post earnings of $0.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.31, delivering a surprise of 6.90%.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.</p><p>Phibro<yt:no-break-space/>, which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $273.16 million for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.09%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $255 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.</p><p>The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.</p><p>Phibro shares have added about 81.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.9%.</p><p><h2>What's Next for Phibro?</h2></p><p>While Phibro has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?</p><p>There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.</p><p>Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Phibro: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.24 on $292.95 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.43 on $1.25 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.</p><p>Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Products is currently in the top 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p>Another stock from the same industry, High Tide Inc. (HITI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended July 2024. The results are expected to be released on September 16.</p><p>This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +33.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.</p><p>High Tide Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $93.3 million, up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328600/phibro-animal-health-pahc-beats-q4-earnings-and-revenue-estimates?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_4-2328600">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

The company is expected to report EPS of $1.86, up 14.11% from the prior-year quarter. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $5.5 billion, showing a 5.82% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.</p><p>For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.24 per share and revenue of $21.54 billion, which would represent changes of +16.96% and +5.46%, respectively, from the prior year.</p><p>It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Waste Management.

It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $2.24, marking an 8.57% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year.

Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.</p><p>Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance.

Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 183, positioning it in the bottom 28% of all 250+ industries.</p><p>The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Wednesday, August 28th, 2024</strong><br /><br />Today&rsquo;s trading environment represented a pullback in valuations across the board in advance of the big Q2 earnings results after the close from<strong> NVIDIA</strong> NVDA. As we discussed in this space early this morning, an inordinate amount of attention has been drawn to the $3 trillion market-cap stock that&rsquo;s already up big year to date.<br /><br />Thus, today&rsquo;s pullback has hit the tech-heavy Nasdaq harder than the other main indexes. The Dow lost -159 points, -0.39%, today. The Nasdaq slipped -198 points, -1.12%. The S&amp;P 500 and small-cap Russell 2000 were -0.60% and -0.47%, respectively, for the session.<br /><br /><h2>The Week&rsquo;s Big News: NVIDIA&rsquo;s Q2 Earnings Report<br /></h2><br />The most important stock on the planet just reported Q2 earnings after the closing bell today. NVIDIA, creator of the GPU and leading the A.I. play in Data Center build-out, posted earnings of 68 cents per share versus the 64 cents in the Zacks consensus. Revenues of $30 billion in the quarter outpaced the Zacks consensus of $28.4 billion, up +122% year over year.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s the seventh-straight earnings beat for CEO Jensen Huang&rsquo;s firm. And next-quarter revenue guidance has been raised to $32.5 billion (plus or minus 1-2%), ahead of the $30.97 billion analysts had earlier configured. Its Data Center segment brought in $26.3 billion in the quarter, +16% from the previous quarter and +154% year over year.<br /><br />Next-quarter&rsquo;s Gross Margins are expected to grow +75%, or terrific anticipation for its Blackwell architecture B200 core processors. Gaming/AI grew +9% in the quarter, Professional Visualization was up +6% and Automotive &amp; Robotics +5%. Yet for all this, shares are selling off -1.5% in the late market, booking some of the +150% profits year to date.<br /><br /><h2>Other Q2 Reports This Afternoon<br /></h2><br />If we want to talk industry innovation, we can also discuss <strong>Salesforce</strong> CRM, which put out Q2 results after the bell this afternoon as well. Earnings of $2.56 per share came in well ahead of the $2.35 analysts were expecting, though quarterly revenues of $9.33 billion were a tad below the $9.35 billion estimate.<br /><br />Next-quarter guidance was good, not stellar: earnings in a range between $2.42-2.44 per share puts it a couple cents above Zacks predictions. Revenues are now expected between $9.31-9.36, below the $9.41 per share consensus. Even with CFO Amy Weaver stepping down, shares are up +4.3% in late trading, adding to the +2% year-to-date gains.<br /><br />Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)-rated <strong>CrowdStrike</strong> CRWD, following a recent data breach that occurred back in July, posted solid wins on its top and bottom lines regardless: earnings of $1.04 per share were nicely ahead of expectations for 98 cents per share. Revenues, at $963.9 million, surpassed the expected $958.6 billion.<br /><br />Due to a data breach during the quarter, CrowdStrike has adjusted next quarter&rsquo;s earnings per share down to 80-81 cents, from the 97 cents per share previous expected. Revenues are now projected to reach between $3.89-3.90 billion. Non-GAAP subscription Gross Margins came in at +81% in the quarter.<br /><br />Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

<![CDATA[ Paccar (PCAR) Gains As Market Dips: What You Should Know ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 22:00:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Paccar (PCAR) ended the recent trading session at $94.53, demonstrating a +0.18% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.6%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.39%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 1.12%.</p><p>The truck maker's shares have seen a decrease of 2.77% over the last month, surpassing the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 3.07% and falling behind the S&P 500's gain of 3.15%.</p><p>The investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Paccar in its upcoming release. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.82, reflecting a 22.22% decrease from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.56 billion, down 8.13% from the prior-year quarter.</p><p>For the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $8.08 per share and a revenue of $31.84 billion, representing changes of -15.92% and -4.44%, respectively, from the prior year.</p><p>Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Paccar should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.</p><p>Our research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.</p><p>The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.28% decrease. Right now, Paccar possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).</p><p>From a valuation perspective, Paccar is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 11.68. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 12.96 of its industry.</p><p>Investors should also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.46 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Automotive - Domestic industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.34 as trading concluded yesterday.</p><p>The Automotive - Domestic industry is part of the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 141, placing it within the bottom 45% of over 250 industries.</p><p>The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.</p><p>Keep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328593/paccar-pcar-gains-as-market-dips-what-you-should-know?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_6v2-2328593">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Victoria's Secret (VSCO) Q2 Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 21:35:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Victoria's Secret (VSCO) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.38 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.24 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.</p><p>This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5.26%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this retailer of lingerie, pajamas and beauty products would post earnings of $0.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.12, delivering a surprise of 9.09%.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.</p><p>Victoria's Secret<yt:no-break-space/>, which belongs to the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Products industry, posted revenues of $1.42 billion for the quarter ended July 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.44%.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>NetApp (NTAP) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.56 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.15 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.</p><p>This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.85%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this data storage company would post earnings of $1.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.80, delivering no surprise.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.</p><p>NetApp<yt:no-break-space/>, which belongs to the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry, posted revenues of $1.54 billion for the quarter ended July 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.46%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.43 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.</p><p>The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.</p><p>NetApp shares have added about 51% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.9%.</p><p><h2>What's Next for NetApp?</h2></p><p>While NetApp has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?</p><p>There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.</p><p>Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for NetApp: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.70 on $1.62 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.86 on $6.55 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.</p><p>Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer- Storage Devices is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Wednesday, August 28, 2024</strong><br /><br />The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today&#39;s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc. (V), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) and The Walt Disney Co. (DIS), as well as two micro-cap stocks FitLife Brands, Inc. (FTLF) and Utah Medical Products, Inc. (UTMD). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.<br /><br />These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.<br /><br />You can <strong>see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong><br /><br />Shares of <strong>Visa</strong> have gained +4.6% over the year-to-date against the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry&rsquo;s gain of +7.9%. The company&rsquo;s strategic acquisitions and alliances are fostering long-term growth and consistently driving its revenues. Visa, fueled by persistent increases in payments, cross-border volumes and sustained investments in technology, is witnessing significant profit growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. It is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. Consumer spending growth is also drying up. Moreover, rising client incentives will affect its adjusted revenues. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Visa here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br /><strong>AstraZeneca&rsquo;s</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+32.3% vs. +29.1%). The company has a diverse product portfolio and a global footprint. Its key drugs like Lynparza, Tagrisso, Imfinzi, Fasenra, Ultomiris and Farxiga should keep driving revenues.&nbsp;<br /><br />AstraZeneca&rsquo;s pipeline is strong, with important late as well as mid-stage pipeline data readouts lined up. It has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth like emerging markets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Backed by its new products and pipeline drugs, AstraZeneca believes it can post industry-leading top-line growth in the 2025-2030 period. By 2030, it expects to generate $80 billion in total revenues. However, AstraZeneca&rsquo;s diabetes franchise faces stiff competition while pricing pressure hurts sales in the respiratory unit.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on AstraZeneca here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br />Shares of <strong>Walt Disney</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry over the year-to-date period (+0.3% vs. +0.1%). The company&rsquo;s third-quarter fiscal 2024 results reflect growth in Disney+ subscribers and theme park and resort businesses.&nbsp;<br /><br />Recent attractions like the Frozen theme land at Hong Kong Disneyland and Walt Disney Park in Paris, as well as the Zootopia theme land at Shanghai Disney, are expected to boost the prospects of the theme park business.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the same time, the company&rsquo;s declining ad revenues due to fewer impressions have been a headwind for some time now. Disney+&rsquo;s profitability is expected to be hurt by higher investments in content, which will also increase programming and production costs in the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. Its leveraged balance sheet remains a concern. Disney+ is facing tough competition from the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Walt Disney here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br /><strong>FitLife Brands&rsquo;</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the year-to-date period (+74.5% vs. +12.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $152.62 million have witnessed 14.7% year-over-year revenue increase in second-quarter 2024, driven by a 17.5% rise in wholesale and 13.3% in online sales.&nbsp;<br /><br />Strategic acquisitions and a shift to online channels, now two-thirds of revenue, boosted margins to 44.8%. Key acquisitions like Mimi&rsquo;s Rock and MusclePharm contribute to growth, with MusclePharm revenues up 27.3% sequentially and Mimi&rsquo;s Rock&rsquo;s gross margin at 48.2%, though integration risks remain. The company&rsquo;s low net debt of $11.7 million supports financial flexibility.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, challenges include declining legacy brand revenues, a 2.2% drop in the MRC segment, and heavy reliance on online sales, posing risks if e-commerce trends shift. High debt and competition in a saturated market also pose concerns.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on FitLife Brands here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br />Shares of <strong>Utah Medical Products</strong> have underperformed the Medical - Products industry over the past six months (-0.2% vs. +7.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $236.34 million is facing challenges from declining revenues, particularly with the Filshie Clip System and significant sales drops to PendoTECH, a key customer.&nbsp;<br /><br />Additionally, foreign exchange risks, increased litigation costs and competitive pressures could further impact UTMD&rsquo;s financial performance, potentially leading to market share erosion. Nevertheless, a strong balance sheet with $89.2 million in cash and no debt as of June 30, 2024, providing flexibility for strategic investments, acquisitions, or shareholder returns.&nbsp;<br /><br />The global medical devices market is growing, with UTMD well-positioned to benefit due to its diverse product portfolio in obstetrics, gynecology, neonatal care and blood pressure monitoring. The company&rsquo;s disciplined cost management reduced COGS and operating expenses, supporting financial stability. UTMD&rsquo;s focus on niche markets offers strategic advantages, although it.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Utah Medical Products here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br />Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Sony Group Corp.

<![CDATA[ 3 Defensive Stocks Outperforming in a Choppy Market (PM, DVA, STWD) ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Broad markets, although continuing to trend higher, are showing signs of increasing volatility and uncertainty. While there has been a strong rally in stocks since the sharp correction earlier in the month, there is something peculiar happening under the surface. Defensive sectors and stocks are making new highs, while the former leaders hover below.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While I have long been encouraging investors join in the mega cap technology and artificial intelligence rally for the long-term, I also noted that the period preceding the US presidential election is likely to be one of elevated volatility and choppy trading action. Since I first made this note, defensive sectors such as healthcare, utilities and real estate have been standout performers.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In the chart below we can see that over the last six weeks, the S&amp;P 500 has languished while the Real Estate ETF&nbsp;</span></span>XLRE<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">, Utilities&nbsp;</span></span>XLU<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;and Healthcare&nbsp;</span></span>XLV<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;have shown considerable outperformance. Three stocks to benefit from this trend include <strong>DaVita&nbsp;</strong></span></span>DVA<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">, <strong>Starwood Property Trust&nbsp;</strong></span></span>STWD<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;and <strong>Philip Morris&nbsp;</strong></span></span>PM<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">, which all enjoy top Zacks Ranks and strong upward momentum.</span></span></p><p><img alt="TradingView" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/2e/75820.jpg?v=889205468" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: TradingView</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>DaVita Shares Trade at a Discount with Strong Growth Estimates</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">DaVita is a leading healthcare provider specializing in kidney care, particularly dialysis services. The company operates a large network of outpatient dialysis centers across the United States and in several international locations. The company is one of the largest dialysis providers in the US and has a 37% market share in the dialysis industry.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">DaVita&rsquo;s earnings revision trend has been climbing higher for more than a year now, and over the last month, estimates again snapped higher, giving it a <strong>Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) </strong>rating. Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 4.6% in the last month and FY25 have been boosted by 11%. The company is expected to grow earnings at a commendable pace as well with FY24 profits projected to grow 18% year-over-year (YoY) and FY25 by 14.4%.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/e3/75815.jpg?v=907859159" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Earnings growth is expected to remain elevated in the coming years, with analysts expecting EPS to grow an average of 17.5% annually over the next three to five years. Based on this forecast, DaVita may be trading at a discount based on the PEG ratio.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Today, DVA is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 15.5x, which is below the market average and in line with its 15-year median. It also boasts a PEG ratio of 0.9.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/16/75816.jpg?v=166628715" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Philip Morris International Stock is on a Tear </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While Philip Morris doesn&rsquo;t fit into any of the leading sectors shared, it can be considered defensive as it has the qualities of a value stock. The company has been public for over 100 years, pays a nice dividend and enjoys a reasonable valuation. Additionally, as the company transitions to a mostly smokeless product line, may be opening the door to investors who have abandoned the tobacco industry for ethical concerns.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In the technical chart below, we can see that after basing for more than two years, the stock has staged an explosive breakout. In addition to powerful momentum sending it higher, PM also has a <strong>Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) </strong>rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 4% over the last month, while current year estimates have jumped by 1.8% in the last month.</span></span></p><p><img alt="TradingView" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/07/75818.jpg?v=1427367096" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: TradingView</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Philip Morris currently offers a dividend yield of 4.2% and has shown a strong commitment to raising that payment. Over the last 15 years the payout has risen from $1.54 to $5.20, which is a CAGR of 8.4%.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b8/75817.jpg?v=1906485487" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Starwood Property Trust Pays a Hefty Dividend</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Starwood Property Trust is a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on originating, acquiring, and managing commercial mortgage loans and other real estate-related debt investments. The company is one of the largest commercial mortgage REITs in the U.S. and is part of Starwood Capital Group, a global private investment firm.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Starwood Property Trust&#39;s portfolio includes a wide range of real estate assets, such as office buildings, retail properties, and multifamily residences. In addition to its commercial lending business, STWD is also involved in infrastructure lending, real estate investing, and property ownership, providing diversified exposure to the real estate market.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In addition to a <strong>Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) </strong>rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, the stock appears to be on the verge of a major breakout. As we have all become aware, the commercial real estate market has been under considerable pressure over the last few years. However, Starwood Property Trust has emerged from the crisis as a leader in the industry.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Starwood also pays a very high dividend yield of 9.4%, further appealing to shareholders.</span></span></p><p><img alt="TradingView" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/24/75819.jpg?v=575701248" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: TradingView</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Should Investors Continue to Hide in Defensive Stocks?</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Given the current market environment, defensive stocks are likely to remain attractive for investors seeking stability amid increasing volatility. With key sectors like healthcare, real estate, and utilities outperforming the broader market, stocks such as DaVita, Philip Morris, and Starwood Property Trust offer strong momentum and income opportunities.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">However, investors should remain mindful of market conditions. While defensive stocks can offer protection during uncertain times, long-term growth opportunities may also arise in other sectors as market sentiment shifts. Balancing a portfolio with both defensive positions and growth-oriented investments could provide a more comprehensive strategy as market dynamics evolve.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2328533/3-defensive-stocks-outperforming-in-a-choppy-market-pm-dva-stwd?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-investment_ideas-2328533">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>PVH Corp. </strong>PVH reported second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein both earnings and revenues topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line significantly improved while the top line fell year over year. Results gained from the strong execution of the PVH+ Plan, which led to robust gross margin expansion and double-digit adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>PVH Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="PVH Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/3f/1724857980.png" title="" width="587" /> <p>PVH Corp. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | PVH Corp. Quote</p></div><h2>Let&rsquo;s Delve Deeper Into PVH&rsquo;s Q2 Performance</h2><p>PVH reported adjusted earnings of $3.01 per share, up 52.0% from the year-ago quarter&#39;s $1.98. The bottom line also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of $2.27 per share and the company&rsquo;s guidance of $2.25.<br /><br />Revenues fell 6% year over year (down 5% at constant currency) to $2,074 million but beat the consensus mark of $2,068 million.<br /><br />The company&#39;s international businesses saw a 4% decrease in revenues (down 3% on a constant currency basis), mostly due to the challenging consumer environment in Asia Pacific, particularly in China and Australia. Additionally, it has been strategically reducing sales in Europe to improve overall sales quality in the region. In North America, combined revenues for the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands saw a rise of 1% from the previous year.<br /><br />Direct-to-consumer revenues declined 5% from the prior-year period (down 3% on a constant-currency basis). Revenues in the company&rsquo;s owned and operated physical stores fell 4% year over year (3% on a constant currency basis). This decrease was largely due to recent softness in the consumer market. The digital commerce unit of the owned and operated stores decreased 6% (5% on a constant-currency basis) year over year, mainly due to reduced sales in Europe.<br /><br />Wholesale revenues fell 9% from the prior-year period (down 8% on a constant-currency basis). The decline was largely due to a 7% reduction in sales of the Heritage Brands women&#39;s intimates business. The remaining decline was attributed to the company&rsquo;s ongoing strategic effort to reduce wholesale revenues in Europe.<br /><br />The company&#39;s gross profit of $1.2 billion dipped 2.1% year over year. The gross margin expanded 250 bps to 60.1% on gains from lower product costs, a favorable shift in channel mix and a fall in sales to lower-margin wholesale accounts.&nbsp;<br /><br />Selling, general and administrative expenses dipped 4.8% year over year to $1.08 billion.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes totaled $173.9 million, up 21.4% from the prior-year quarter.</p><h2>PVH&rsquo;s Segmental Analysis</h2><p>Revenues for the Calvin Klein segment were down 1% year over year (flat on a constant currency basis). The segment recorded a 2% sales decline (flat in constant currency) at Calvin Klein International and 1% increase at Calvin Klein North America.<br /><br />Revenues for the Tommy Hilfiger brand dropped 4% year over year (down 3% in constant currency). Revenues fell 6% (down 5% in constant currency) in Tommy Hilfiger International, mostly due to reduced sales in Europe.<br /><br />The Heritage Brands segment&#39;s revenues plunged 60% year over year. This included a 56% year-over-year decline in the sale of the Heritage Brands women&#39;s intimates business.</p><h2>A Closer Look at PVH&#39;s Financial Performance</h2><p>PVH ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $0.6 billion, long-term debt of $1.7 billion and stockholders&#39; equity of $5.2 billion.<br /><br />In alignment with the PVH+ Plan&#39;s objective to return excess cash to shareholders, the company executed the repurchase of 2.0 million shares of its common stock, amounting to $25 million. It expects to repurchase shares of $400 million for the fiscal year 2024.</p><h2>PVH&rsquo;s Guidance</h2><p>For the third quarter, revenues are projected to decline in the range of 6-7% (down 7-8% in constant currency) from the year-ago quarter, including a 2% reduction related to the Heritage Brands sale.<br /><br />EPS, on a non-GAAP basis, is expected to be $2.50 compared with $2.90 in the year-ago quarter. This view includes an unfavorable currency impact of 5 cents per share. EPS, on a GAAP basis, is expected to be $2.30 compared with $2.66 in the year-ago quarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />For fiscal 2024, the company anticipates a year-over-year revenue decline in the range of 6-7%, which is consistent on a constant currency basis. This includes a 2% reduction due to the divestiture of the Heritage Brands women&rsquo;s intimates business and a 1% impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023.<br /><br />PVH expects the adjusted operating margin to be nearly flat compared with 10.1% in fiscal 2023. On a GAAP basis, the operating margin is likely to be about 9.8%, down from the 10.1% projected earlier.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Management now envisions non-GAAP EPS in the range of $11.55-$11.80 compared with the earlier view of $11-$11.25. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the band of $11.20-$11.45 compared with the prior guidance of $11.15-$11.40. The company recorded non-GAAP EPS of $10.68 and GAAP EPS of $10.76 in fiscal 2023. The EPS guidance for fiscal 2024 includes a negative impact of around 5 cents per share from currency movements.<br /><br />Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 15.4% in the past three months compared to the industry&rsquo;s 1.5% decline.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/95/75796.jpg?v=546827582" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Key Picks</h2><p>Some better-ranked stocks are <strong>Wolverine World Wide</strong> WWW, <strong>Kontoor Brands Inc. </strong>KTB and<strong> Funko, Inc. </strong>FNKO.<br /><br />Wolverine World Wide designs, manufactures and distributes a wide variety of casual and active apparel and footwear.

<![CDATA[ Is Apple Stock "Under-owned"? ETFs in Focus ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Apple</strong> AAPL stock has gained 22.4% so far this year (as of Monday) and 26.1% in the past year. The company has been a laggard in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, but has picked up momentum of late.</p><p>Daniel Loeb-backed Third Point hedge fund bet big on the stock, according to Street.com, on its latest AI initiative. Third Point started to buy Apple shares in April, and the stock was one of its portfolio&#39;s top five winners for the second quarter.</p><p>Loeb also said that Apple&rsquo;s stock had become increasingly &#39;under-owned&#39; by institutional investors, and its relative multiple had squeezed toward a multi-year low, despite Apple stock&rsquo;s recent run.&nbsp; In its second-quarter earnings report, Warren Buffett&#39;s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a huge reduction in its stake in Apple, citing high valuations, as quoted on Economic Times.</p><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Should You Play Apple Stock With ETFs?</strong></span></p><p>Since there still are uncertainties related to the success of Apple&rsquo;s upcoming AI rollout, it is better to track the company with the exchange-traded-fund (ETF) approach. The basket approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks. Apple-heavy ETFs include the likes of <strong>Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund</strong> XLK, <strong>iShares Global Tech ETF</strong> IXN and <strong>iShares U.S. Technology ETF</strong> IYW. Let&rsquo;s delve a little deeper into the stock&rsquo;s potential.</p><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Apple&#39;s AI Initiative </strong></span></p><p>Loeb has previewed Apple&rsquo;s new artificial intelligence feature, &quot;Apple Intelligence,&quot; as a gamechanger. The AI feature is set to launch in October with iOS 18. This feature looks to enhance Siri (Apple&rsquo;s original smartphone voice assistant), automate tasks like email generation and image sorting, and integrate advanced functions such as automated photo cleanup and ChatGPT. Loeb expects AI-driven growth to bolster revenues and earnings of Apple.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Apple&rsquo;s Privacy-Focused Cloud Services</strong></span></h2><p>Apple has developed a new cloud service called Private Cloud Compute to ensure user privacy. This service uses Apple Silicon with built-in privacy capabilities that determine whether a request can be processed on device or needs cloud access. Apple has assured that no user information will be stored in the cloud.</p><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Recent Financial Performance of Apple</strong></span></p><p>Apple reported robust third-quarter earnings, surpassing earnings per share and revenue estimates. While iPhone sales remain important, the iPad segment saw strong growth, indicating market expansion opportunities. However, challenges in Greater China impacted regional sales.</p><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Broker Rating for AAPL Stock</strong></span></p><p>Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated on the basis of actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 31 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.62 a month ago based on 30 recommendations.</p><p>Of the 31 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 61.29% and 9.68% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 66.67%, while Buy represented 10%.</p><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Price Target for AAPL Shares</strong></span></p><p>Based on short-term price targets offered by 31 analysts, the average price target for Apple stock comes to $241.68. The forecasts range from a low of $184.00 to a high of $300.00. The average price target represents an increase of 6.38% from the closing price of $227.18 recorded on Monday.</p><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Any Wall of Worry for Apple?</strong></span></p><p>Apple&rsquo;s competitors have faced several AI hiccups before. Google&rsquo;s Bard provided incorrect answers, and its Gemini image generator displayed inaccurate images. Microsoft&rsquo;s Copilot+PC standard raised security concerns, while Meta faced criticism for not allowing users to disable its AI chatbot. Apple has always thrived on its reputation for security. Hence, any flaws in its generative AI efforts could harm its brand.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328525/is-apple-stock-under-owned-etfs-in-focus?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2328525">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

Earnings are also projected to rise 9% to $2.93 per share versus Q2 EPS of $2.68 in the prior-year quarter.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Notably, Lululemon has surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus for 16 consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 7.42% in its last four quarterly reports.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/88/75806.jpg?v=1466595821" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Monitoring LULU&rsquo;s Growth Trajectory</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Overall, Lululemon&rsquo;s total sales are now projected to rise 10% in its current fiscal 2025 and are expected to increase another 8% in FY26 to $11.46 billion. Lululemon&rsquo;s bottom line is currently slated to expand 10% in FY25 as well with annual earnings projected to rise another 9% in FY26 to $15.31 per share.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3a/75807.jpg?v=443915064" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Price Performance &amp; Valuation Comparison</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Year to date, Lululemon&rsquo;s stock has plunged nearly -50% to vastly underperform the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s +18% and Adidas&rsquo;s +24%. Lululemon has also trailed the lackluster YTD performance of Nike and Under Armour which are down -23% and -10% respectively.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Giving up most of its lofty gains in recent years, Lululemon&rsquo;s stock is still up +38% over the last five years which has lagged the broader market but has topped Adidas, Nike, and Under Armour.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/27/75810.jpg?v=1647529677" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Trading around $255 a share, LULU trades at 19.1X forward earnings and a slight discount to the benchmark&rsquo;s 23.7X. LULU also trades nicely beneath Nike&rsquo;s 27.5X forward earnings multiple and a significant discount to Adidas&#39;s 69.3X and Under Armour&rsquo;s 38X.</span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d7/75813.jpg?v=2032751194" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Takeaway</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While broader economic concerns impacting Lululemon&rsquo;s stock appear to be overdone considering its attractive valuation, LULU lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). To that point, reaching or exceeding Q2 expectations will be crucial to shaking these fears and reconfirming Lululemon&rsquo;s attractive growth trajectory but long-term investors may certainly be rewarded from current levels.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328524/time-to-buy-lululemon-s-lulu-stock-for-a-rebound-as-q2-earnings-approach?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-stocks_in_the_news-2328524">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ SM Energy Shares Gain More Than 20%: Time to Buy the Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 18:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SM Energy</strong> SM shares have surged 20.7% year to date (YTD), significantly outperforming the 2.7% growth seen by the broader industry. A key factor behind this growth is the company&rsquo;s strong presence in the Midland Basin, a sub-basin of the Permian. Additionally, SM Energy&rsquo;s recent agreement to acquire assets in the Uinta Basin from XCL Resources marks a shift from its traditional focus on the Permian.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d6/75707.jpg?v=590844052" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">For investors, the critical consideration is how to position themselves in response to these developments. However, before exploring investment strategies, it&rsquo;s essential to revisit some core fundamentals of this leading exploration and production company.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">SM&rsquo;s Solid Footprint in Oil-Rich Midland Basin</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">SM Energy generates most of its revenues from operations in the Midland Basin. In the second quarter, more than 60% of the company&rsquo;s revenues came from its activities in this region, with production totaling 7,249 thousand barrels of oil equivalent, 64% of which was oil. With oil prices expected to remain strong, the business outlook for this upstream firm appears promising.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="SM Energy" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/45/75705.jpg?v=1414588953" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: SM Energy</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2024, SM Energy plans to drill a net of 72 wells and complete a net of 71 wells in the Midland Basin, highlighting the company&#39;s strong commitment to this region. The company&rsquo;s operations in the Midland Basin span across 111,000 net acres, reflecting its focus on maximizing production and growth in this area.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Uinta Basin Acquisition Agreement: SM&rsquo;s Growth Driver</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">On June 27, SM Energy inked an accord to acquire 80% of Uinta Basin oil and gas assets owned by certain entities affiliated with XCL Resources for a net purchase price of $2.04 billion. Once the acquisition closes, it will add approximately 37,200 net acres to the company&rsquo;s top-tier portfolio. This will not only increase oil production significantly but will add roughly 390 net drilling locations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Many analysts believe that while the Uinta Basin is smaller, it might have the potential to outperform the Permian Basin due to its higher oil content and lower operating costs. This makes the Uinta Basin an attractive area for future development and could enhance SM Energy&rsquo;s overall performance.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Is SM Energy Stock a Wise Investment Choice Right Now?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Once completed, likely by Oct. 1, the acquisition is expected to immediately enhance SM Energy&#39;s financials. This move will allow the company to maximize its return on capital while preserving its strong balance sheet. Supported by these positive developments, the board of directors has authorized an 11% increase in the fixed quarterly dividend, which is anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further, SM Energy&rsquo;s board of directors has authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program, which will run through 2027 and replace the remaining portion of the existing program.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The outlook for SM Energy is exceptionally promising, making it a compelling addition for investors. Sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), SM Energy stands out as a top pick You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investing in SM Energy at this time is also supported by the stock&#39;s valuations. SM shares are relatively inexpensive, with the current 3.88X trailing 12-month Enterprise Value (EV)/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) staying below the 4.09X five-year median. Additionally, SM Energy is trading at a discount compared to the industry average of 7.43X. It is also cheaper than larger exploration and production players such as <strong>EOG Resources, Inc.</strong> EOG and <strong>ConocoPhillips</strong> COP, which have respective EV/EBITDA of 5.47X and 5.54X.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b5/75708.jpg?v=324235315" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328520/sm-energy-shares-gain-more-than-20-time-to-buy-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2328520">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 18:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Wall Street&rsquo;s darling semiconductor stock <strong>NVIDIA Corporation</strong> NVDA has witnessed a meteoric rise in the last few years, banking on the growing interest in cryptocurrency and the advent of artificial intelligence (AI).&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA&rsquo;s graphic processing units (GPUs) are applied to train large language models, the mainstay of generative AI. Big cloud providers are thus grabbing several of NVIDIA&rsquo;s chips, which helped its market cap jump from around $424 billion to $3.1 trillion in the past two years.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2023, NVIDIA stock rallied more than 200%. NVIDIA&rsquo;s shares have already outperformed the Semiconductor - General industry this year (+159.1% vs +109.1%).</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b8/75665.jpg?v=685234830" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p><p><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Such a steep rise in share prices has led NVIDIA to announce a 10-for-1 stock split. After all, $1,000 invested at the beginning of the year would be worth $1,591 today.</p><p>The launch of the next-generation Blackwell AI chips scheduled later this year, and the growing gaming and industrial metaverse market are expected to help the NVIDIA stock scale further upward. The company&rsquo;s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 106.9% (read more: Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold NVIDIA Stock Before Q2 Earnings?).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA is now the second largest company worldwide, behind <strong>Apple Inc.</strong> AAPL. Investors have set their sights on finding the next NVIDIA stock that has a growing interest in AI and offers a highly scalable business. Two of the prominent names are <strong>Super Micro Computer, Inc.</strong> SMCI and <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited</strong> TSM. Here&rsquo;s why &ndash;&nbsp;</p><h2>SMCI Stock &ndash; A Dominant Player in the AI Server Market</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Super Micro is giving stiff competition to established players in the AI server market like <strong>Dell Technologies Inc</strong>. DELL. The company has been able to make the most of the unquenchable demand for AI servers, a market that is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 18% from the current year to 2032, per Global Market Insights.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Super Micro manufactures unfaltering AI servers required to mount AI chips that semiconductor companies sell. Super Micro recorded $14.94 billion in sales in fiscal 2024, up 110% year over year.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Super Micro accounts for only 10% of the AI server market share, a tell-tale sign that it has more room to expand its business. <strong>Bank of America Corporation</strong> BAC has already projected Super Micro&rsquo;s share in the AI server market to jump to 17% in the next three years.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Super Micro&rsquo;s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter and year is 117.2% and 51.7%, respectively. Eminent brokerage companies have also increased the average short-term price target of SMCI by 65% from the stock&rsquo;s last closing price of $562.51. Brokers have set the highest price target at $1,500, an upside of 166.7%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a6/75666.jpg?v=473708919" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p><p><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>TSM Stock &ndash; Exploiting the Growing Demand in AI Applications</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Based in Taiwan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Silicon Valley,&rdquo; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC is a semiconductor manufacturing foundry that has seen huge gains from the global AI boom.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TSMC expects a growing demand for its cutting-edge chips as more companies, such as Apple, begin to install AI features in smartphones. TSMC&rsquo;s manufacturing competence is needed for GPUs to be operative. These GPUs form an integral part of data centers where huge data are stored. These data are required for AI applications like Open AI&rsquo;s ChatGPT, whose demand has skyrocketed.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Wall Street has resumed its rally as investors are trying to move on from the panic selling earlier this month, sparked by recession fears. The recent rally is being fueled by a spate of positive economic data and the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s indication that rate cuts are on the horizon.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, inflation continues to be the biggest threat to the economy as it is still above the Fed&rsquo;s 2% target, which could keep markets volatile for a longer period. Given this situation, prudent investors seeking regular income and capital preservation might consider staying invested in or purchasing dividend stocks. Four such stocks are <strong>Napco Security Technologies, Inc.</strong> NSSC, <strong>Northrim BanCorp, Inc.</strong> NRIM, <strong>Intuit Inc.</strong> INTU and <strong>SS&amp;C Technologies Holdings, Inc.</strong> SSNC.</p><h2>Interest Rate Cut on the Horizon</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">It has been a great year for Wall Street after an impressive 2023. Year to date, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have gained 9.5%, 18% and 18.3%, respectively. Inflation has shown signs of cooling over the past quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consumer price index (CPI) rose a meager 0.2% sequentially in July, which came in line with analysts&rsquo; expectations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On a year-over-year basis, CPI climbed 2.9%, lower than the consensus estimate of a rise of 3% and the lowest since March 2021. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, also rose 0.2% month over month in July.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Federal Reserve now believes that inflation is declining sharply and it could go ahead with its planned rate cuts. Last week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also indicated during his speech at Jackson Hole, WY, that rate cuts are on the horizon.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although Powell didn&rsquo;t say when or how big the rate cuts would be, his comments gave investors&rsquo; confidence a boost.</p><h2>Crisis Period Still Not Over</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Although inflation has been declining steadily, it is still above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s 2% target and central bank officials will keep a close watch on the situation after the first rate cut, which is likely to happen in September.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also, the U.S. Presidential election is approaching in November, which could play a major role in market movements.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks That Recently Declared Dividend Hikes</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">It would thus be ideal to invest in dividend stocks. These companies, with their well-established operations, consistently pay dividends and maintain profitability due to their reliable business models. In a highly volatile market, companies that offer high dividend payouts often outperform those that do not pay dividends.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Napco Security Technologies, Inc. </strong>is engaged in the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of security alarm products and door security devices for commercial and residential installations.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Four Corners Property Trust </strong>FCPT recently announced the acquisition of 19 Bloomin&rsquo; Brands restaurant properties for $66.4 million. The move aligns with FCPT&rsquo;s portfolio expansion efforts, with real estate leased to strong credit operators.</p><p>The properties comprised a total of 20 restaurants, including 10 Outback Steakhouse restaurants and 10 Carrabba&rsquo;s Italian Grill restaurants. The 19 properties are located throughout 10 states namely Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee.</p><p>The sites are situated in strong retail corridors characterized by high footfall traffic and appealing demographic profiles. The properties are secured under two long-term master leases, each encompassing 10 restaurants, and are leased to corporate entities of Bloomin&rsquo; Brands. The transaction was executed at a capitalization rate in range with prior FCPT transactions.</p><h2>FCPT&rsquo;s Past Acquisitions</h2><p>Of late, this real estate investment trust (REIT), mainly engaged in the ownership and acquisition of high-quality, net-leased restaurant and retail properties, has been on an acquisition spree.</p><p>In June, Four Corners announced the acquisition of MercyOne outpatient clinic property located in a strong retail corridor in Iowa for $3 million. The property is corporate-operated under a long-term, triple-net lease.</p><p>In the same month, Four Corners announced the acquisition of Mercy Health Clinic property, located in a strong retail corridor in Missouri, for $3.8 million. The property is corporate-operated under a triple-net lease.</p><p>These strategic moves not only broaden FCPT&#39;s footprint in various sectors but also ensure portfolio diversification. This benefits both the company and its investors as they gain exposure to growing industries and establish long-term lease agreements with strong tenants.</p><p>Moreover, during the second quarter, Four Corners acquired 17 properties for a combined purchase price of $45.5 million at an initial weighted average cash yield of 7.2% on rents in place as of June 30, 2024, and a weighted average remaining lease term of 13.1 years.</p><p>As of June 30, 2024, Four Corners&rsquo; rental portfolio comprised 1,154 properties located in 47 states. The properties are 99.6% occupied under long-term, net leases with a weighted average remaining lease term of around 7.4 years.</p><p>Over the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 15.1% compared with the industry&#39;s growth of 11.8%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3e/75801.jpg?v=272099964" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Other Stocks to Consider</h2><p>Some other top-ranked stocks from the broader REIT sector are <strong>Cousins Properties</strong> CUZ and <strong>Lamar Advertising</strong> LAMR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

<![CDATA[ Analyzing NVIDIAs Stock Chart Ahead of Earnings ]]>

<![CDATA[ <iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6c2ZwrRDac?rel=0" width="560"></iframe><p>The most captivating stock of the 2020s continues to own the decade. The incredible global demand for its state-of-the-art GPUs keeps the stock running hot. <strong>NVIDIA (</strong>NVDA<strong>)</strong> is so far ahead of everyone else in the global race that at times it&rsquo;s just not fair. Its nearest competition is light years away.</p><p>While they all try to play catchup, NVIDIA revenue estimates keep ticking higher. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s been all sunshine and lollipops for the stock. To the contrary, the summer was rough on the chip giant. A rotation out of NVIDIA and into small caps helped NVDA track lower since its most recent stock split. NVDA shares hit all-time highs of $140.76 on June 20<sup>th</sup> before dumping down under $100, hitting lows of $90.69 on August 5<sup>th</sup>, the day that the Yen carry trade seemingly blew up.</p><p>Heading into earnings, some sideways action during a period of consolidation. A good report will take out the all-time highs, presumably taking with it some buy stops from the shorts. A bad report should put the $100 level back on the radar, with the 200-day lying another $4 shy of the August lows.</p><p><strong>Moving Averages</strong>: Bartosiak starts by examining the stock&#39;s moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.</p><p><strong>Support and Resistance Levels</strong>: Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.</p><p><strong>Chart Patterns</strong>: He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.</p><p><strong>Volume Analysis</strong>: He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.</p><p>Dave Bartosiak&#39;s technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding NVIDIA&rsquo;s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it&#39;s important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328504/analyzing-nvidias-stock-chart-ahead-of-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-video_blog-2328504">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ BankUnited Stock Soars 45% in 6 Months: Should You Buy BKU Now? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 17:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BankUnited Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s BKU shares have skyrocketed 45% in the past six months and are currently trading just 3.8% below its 52-week high of $39.51 touched on July 31. The stock has outperformed the industry, the S&amp;P 500 Index and its close peers <strong>Fifth Third Bancorp</strong> FITB, <strong>Huntington Bancshares Incorporated</strong> HBAN and <strong>Hilltop Holdings Inc.</strong> HTH.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Six-Month Price Performance Chart</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ea/75790.jpg?v=1654986337" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">BKU&rsquo;s sustained emphasis on improving the deposit mix and solid balance sheet will keep aiding its financials in the long run.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Bullish Analyst Sentiments for BKU</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.87 and $3.24 per share for 2024 and 2025, respectively, has moved marginally upward. These metrics imply growth of 1.4% for this year and 12.9% for 2025.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Estimate Revision Trend</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/95/75791.jpg?v=1292512193" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Likely to Drive BankUnited Stock Higher</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Fed&rsquo;s Rate Cuts to Further Aid Financials:</strong></em> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday said, &ldquo;The time has come for policy to adjust.&rdquo; This has set the stage for the first interest rate cut since March 2020. This would further complement BankUnited&rsquo;s strategy to lower funding costs through improving the deposit mix.<br /><br />Currently, interest rates are at a 23-year high level of 5.25-5.5%, which had a multifaceted effect on the banks. Though high interest rates have been driving a significant rise in net interest income (NII), the rising funding costs have been exerting pressure on NII and net interest margin (NIM).<br /><br />BKU&rsquo;s NII witnessed a four-year CAGR of 3.8% through 2019-2023. NIM declined from 2.47% in 2019 to 2.35% in 2020, due to lower interest rates, and rebounded to 2.38% in 2021 and 2.68% in 2022 amid the high interest rates, with a further dip in 2023 to 2.56% due to rising funding costs.<br />&nbsp;<br />NII dipped in the first half of 2024 due to rising funding costs, while the NIM improved driven by a higher yield in average earnings assets.<br /><br />The interest rate cuts will lead to further stabilization of the deposit costs for BKU. Also, as rates come down, demand for wholesale and consumer loans will improve. This, in turn, will lead to growth in NII and NIM.<br /><br />Management anticipates NII to rise in mid-single-digit to low/high double digits. Further, NIM is expected to reach the high 2% range (higher than 2.72% reached in the second quarter) by the end of 2024 and improve further in 2025.<br /><br />We project NII to reflect a 2.6% CAGR by 2026, while NIM is anticipated to be 2.73%, 2.91%, and 2.99% in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.<br /><br /><em><strong>Strategizing Low-Cost Deposits &amp; Decent Loan Demand:</strong></em> Management&rsquo;s emphasis on the acquisition of low-cost deposits will likely bolster top-line expansion. As of June 30, 2024, non-interest-bearing deposits accounted for 29% of total deposits.<br /><br />The company anticipates steady growth in the deposits in light of a strengthened pipeline for the same. Further, management aims to improve the deposit mix by gradually increasing the non-interest demand deposit account share to more than 30% over time.<br /><br />Management expects commercial &amp; industrial and commercial real estate loans to grow in the high single-digit range this year, while residential loans are anticipated to shrink further at a similar pace as in 2023.<br /><br />Over the years, BKU has witnessed solid organic growth, driven by robust loans and deposit balances. The company&rsquo;s revenues witnessed a three-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.8% (2020-2023). The net loans experienced a 3.8% CAGR over the last five years ended 2023), while deposits recorded a CAGR of 3.1%.<br />&nbsp;<br />The uptrend continued for net loans, deposits and revenues in the first half of 2024.<br /><br />We project total revenues to witness a CAGR of 2.7% by 2026.<br /><br /><em><strong>Strong Balance Sheet Position:</strong></em> As of June 30, 2024, the company had a total debt of $4 billion, while cash and cash equivalents were $433.5 million as of the same date, reflecting a strong liquidity position.<br /><br />Management has been paying down its debt to reduce the interest burden in the second quarter of 2024, the company reduced its FHLB Advances by roughly 16% on a sequential basis.<br /><br />Further, at the end of the second quarter of 2024, its times interest earned ratio and total debt/capital were 1.9X and 54.9%, respectively. This indicates that the company is well-managed to deal with its high debt levels in the near term, even if economic turmoil occurs.<br /><br /><em><strong>Strong Capital Position:</strong></em> BankUnited&rsquo;s focus on maintaining a strong capital position will support its capital distribution activities. As of June 30, 2024, the company&rsquo;s capital ratios were well above the regulatory requirements. Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and a total risk-based capital ratio were 11.6% and 13.6%, respectively.<br />&nbsp;<br />Since 2022, the company has been hiking its dividend payout annually, with the latest hike announced this February to 29 cents per share. The company has increased its dividend four times in the past five years, with a five-year annualized dividend growth of 6.2%.<br />&nbsp;<br />Similarly, FITB and HTH have increased their dividend four and five times in the past five years, respectively, while HBAN raised its dividend twice in the same time frame.<br />&nbsp;<br />Currently, BKU has a 43% dividend payout ratio, which boosts investors&rsquo; confidence and enhances shareholder value.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dividend Yield</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/62/75792.jpg?v=1496925081" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">BKU also has a share repurchase program in place. As of June 30, 2024, $20.2 million worth of shares remained available under the authorization. Though management is unlikely to pursue buybacks until it sees stability in the economy, the company&rsquo;s earnings strength is anticipated to help sustain its efficient capital distributions.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Final Thoughts on BKU Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">BankUnited&rsquo;s improving deposit mix, decent loan demand, and solid balance sheet are likely to support its financials. Moreover, the Fed&rsquo;s decision to implement rate cuts will further reinforce the company&rsquo;s current initiative to mitigate funding cost pressures and improve NIM.<br /><br />Thus, given the fundamental strength and favorable macroeconomic dynamics, BKU stock remains a lucrative bet for investors now.<br /><br />BKU currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

<![CDATA[ Trupanion Stock Near 52-Week High: Time to Buy or Hold? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <strong>Trupanion Inc </strong>TRUP closed at $47.21 on Tuesday, near its 52-week high of $48.85, after having gained 54.8% in the past three months. Shares outperformed the industry, the Finance sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index in the same time frame.&nbsp;<br /><br />Banking on sustained revenue growth, margin expansion and operational expertise, the insurer delivered earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">TRUP Outperforms Industry, Sector and S&amp;P 500</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/05/75765.jpg?v=930412639" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trupanion is a provider of insurance for cats and dogs in the United States, Canada, Continental Europe and Australia. It operates in a large but underpenetrated market. Trupanion noted less than 4% of pets are insured in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada with same low number across most of Europe. With the change in the attitude of pet owners, who are increasingly focusing on pet health and well-being, TRUP has a strong chance to capitalize on the growth in a total addressable market worth $34.1 billion.&nbsp; The insurer envisions doubling its addressable market (defined by the number of veterinary hospitals) by the end of 2030.</p><h2>TRUP&rsquo;s Optimistic Projection</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings indicates an improvement of 65.7% on 14.8% higher revenues. The consensus estimate for 2025 earnings suggests an increase of 144.3% on 6.2% higher revenues. The expected long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 40.4%, better than the industry average of 18.4%. It has a Growth Score of A.&nbsp;<br /><br />TRUP projects revenues in the range of $1.263-$1.279 billion, up 14% from the 2023 level. Subscription revenues are projected between $850 million and $858 million, revised from $842 million and $862 million guided earlier. Total adjusted operating income is expected in the range of $108-$115 million, revised from $100-$120 million expected earlier.<br /><br />Over the long term, TRUP remains focused on growing adjusted operating income and deploying increasing amounts at high internal rates of return. The pet insurer&rsquo;s five-year plan includes a 15% adjusted operating margin.</p><h2>Positive Analyst Sentiment Instills Confidence in TRUP</h2><p>Two of the three analysts covering the stock have raised estimates for 2024 and 2025 over the past 30 days. The consensus estimate for 2024 loss has narrowed to 37 cents from 40 cents expected earlier, while the consensus estimate for 2025 is pegged at earnings of 6 cents per share, up from 2 cents expected earlier.</p><h2>Factors Favoring Trupanion</h2><p>Average monthly retention continues to remain strong, coupled with an increase in total enrolled subscription pets.&nbsp; The cost of veterinary care continues to rise, outpacing consumer discretionary income, as noted by management. The role of pricing thus plays an important part, both in keeping the growth pace alive and in comforting pet parents.&nbsp;<br /><br />The insurer has also been expanding globally as part of its five-year growth plan, apart from strengthening its compelling portfolio. TRUP noticed increasing contributions from European endeavors. Given the underpenetrated market, it sees opportunities to enroll more pets with increasing acquisition spend. &nbsp;<br /><br />To ramp up growth, it is introducing new products. Its portfolio of products comprising Chewy and Aflac, medium and low average monthly revenue per unit (ARPU) products Firkin and Phi Direct and products in continental Europe contributed 17% growth to gross new pet addition in the second quarter of 2024. TRUP intends to launch a Trupanion-branded product in Europe this year and is hopeful about its partnership with <strong>Aflac Incorporated </strong>AFL in the United States.<br /><br />A sturdy capital position aided by operational strength supports investment in new product development and international expansion. Trupanion expects these investments to extend moat and expand the addressable market in the long run.</p><h2>Concerns Regarding TRUP</h2><p>Despite the upside potential, there are a few factors that investors should keep an eye on.<br /><br />Though the insurer&rsquo;s revenues are increasing and costs are declining, they are not sufficient to cover expenses, positioning the company to incur losses in the next few quarters.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, the leverage compares unfavorably with the industry average.&nbsp;<br /><br />TRUP&rsquo;s trailing 12-month ROE of -6.3% is worse when compared with the industry average of 16.2%, reflecting TRUP&rsquo;s inefficiency in using shareholders&#39; funds. Also, the return on invested capital in the trailing 12 months was -1.1%, comparing unfavorably with the industry average of 7.8%, reflecting the insurer&rsquo;s inefficiency in utilizing funds to generate income.</p><h2>TRUP&rsquo;s Valuation</h2><p>Valuation remains expensive at the current level. It is currently trading at a price-to-book multiple of 6.48, higher than the industry average of 1.85.&nbsp; As it is still incurring losses, potential investors might not want to pay a premium price.<br /><br /><strong>MetLife Inc</strong>. MET, which also provides pet insurance, is trading at a multiple lower than the industry average.</p><h2>Parting Thoughts</h2><p>TRU&rsquo;s focus on pet health and well-being in an underpenetrated pet insurance market, product launches, extended operating boundaries and a solid capital position poise it for growth. It envisions a total shareholder return of 20% with a revenue increase of 15% over the long term.<br /><br />Given a premium valuation, expected losses in the near term and a negative return on capital, it is better to adopt a cautious stance for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />Thus, investors who already hold TRUP stock should retain it and new investors can wait for a better entry point, given its growth prospects.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328501/trupanion-stock-near-52-week-high-time-to-buy-or-hold?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2328501">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Eli Lilly Launches Discounted Versions of Obesity Drug Zepbound ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 17:18:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Eli Lilly and Company </strong>LLY announced the launch of single-dose vials of its popular obesity drug, Zepbound (tirzepatide), to meet supply shortages in response to high demand. These 2.5 mg and 5 mg single-dose vials are priced at least 50% lower than the list price of&nbsp;competing GLP-1 medicines for obesity. A four-week supply of the 2.5 mg vials has been priced at $399 while the same for the 5 mg dose will cost $549. Zepbound is presently available in a single-dose pen (autoinjector). The vials should be easier to manufacture than the pens and can help improve supply.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These cheaper versions of Zepbound will be available through Lilly&rsquo;s direct-to-consumer website called LillyDirect for self-pay by patients with a valid on-label prescription. The availability of these Zepbound single-dose vials is expected to broaden access for obesity patients especially those without insurance. The launch of single-dose vials also lowers the need for people to use compounded versions of tirzepatide.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Several pharmacies, weight loss clinics and medical spas are selling/making compounded versions of Mounjaro and Zepbound. Lilly has time and again warned against the use of custom-made products claiming to contain tirzepatide that are made or distributed by compounding pharmacies. These products are not approved by the FDA and can pose serious health risks to users.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date, Lilly&rsquo;s stock has risen 63.7% compared with an increase of 27.1% for the industry.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/5e/75650.jpg?v=238825848" style="height: 300px; width: 610px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>LLY Improves Tirzepatide Supply to Meet High Demand</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Zepbound and Lilly&rsquo;s type-II diabetes drug, Mounjaro includes the same compound tirzepatide, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist (GIP/GLP-1 RA). The GLP-1 segment is an important class of drugs for multiple cardiometabolic diseases and is gaining significant popularity. Per research conducted by Goldman Sachs, the obesity market in the United States is expected to reach $130 billion by 2030.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite a short time on the market, Mounjaro and Zepbound have become key top-line drivers for Lilly in 2024, with demand rising rapidly. Mounjaro and Zepbound generated sales of almost $6.7 billion in the first half of 2024, accounting for 44% of the company&rsquo;s total revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound is extremely strong and exceeds supply. Lilly faced supply shortages in the first half of the year due to skyrocketing demand. Lilly has built, upgraded or acquired new facilities in the United States and Europe to improve supply, and the benefit of these investments is showing now as the supply chain for these drugs has improved. With supply improving, Lilly has better visibility on its production plans for Mounjaro and Zepbound for the year and planned launches of Mounjaro in international markets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lilly is investing broadly in obesity and has 11 new molecules currently in clinical development, including two late-stage candidates, orforglipron, an oral GLP-1 small molecule and retatrutide, a GGG tri-agonist. Several phase III data readouts are expected in 2025.</p><h2>Other Players in the GLP-1 Market</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Lilly&rsquo;s tirzepatide medicines face strong competition from <strong>Novo Nordisk</strong>&rsquo;s NVO semaglutide. Semaglutide is approved as Ozempic pre-filled pen and Rybelsus oral tablet for type II diabetes and as Wegovy injection for weight management. Novo Nordisk is also working to improve the supply of Wegovy in response to rising demand but has not been as successful as Lilly in its efforts. The launch of these affordable versions of Zepbound could put further pressure on Novo Nordisk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Viking Therapeutics&nbsp;</strong>VKTX is developing VK2735 as a subcutaneous injection and as an oral pill for treating obesity. The candidate has demonstrated superior weight reduction in clinical studies. Viking Therapeutics plans to advance the subcutaneous formulation to late-stage development and start a mid-stage study on the oral formulation before 2024-end. Viking&rsquo;s stock was down around 6.2% on Tuesday as Lilly&rsquo;s latest move to strengthen its presence in the obesity market creates further pressure on this small biotech whose obesity candidate is nearing late-stage development.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Amgen </strong>AMGN also has a GLP-1 receptor candidate, MariTide (maridebart cafraglutide), for obesity in its pipeline. Top-line 52-week data from the phase II study on MariTide in adults with overweight or obesity is expected in late 2024. Amgen is planning to conduct a comprehensive phase III program on the candidate across obesity, obesity-related conditions and type-II diabetes. Amgen plans to begin a phase II study on the candidate in type II diabetes in late 2024.</p><h2>Lilly&rsquo;s Zacks Rank</h2><p>Lilly has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) currently.

<![CDATA[ Malibu Boats Gears up to Report Q4 Earnings: What to Expect? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Malibu Boats, Inc.</strong> MBUU is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug. 29, before market open.<br /><br />In the last reported quarter, MBUU&rsquo;s earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 37%, while net sales missed the same by 1.2%. The top and bottom lines declined year over year by 45.8% and 75.7%, respectively.<br /><br />Malibu Boats&rsquo; earnings topped the consensus mark in each of the four trailing quarters, the average surprise being 25.6%.</p><h2>MBUU&rsquo;s Trend in Estimate Revision</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth-quarter loss per share has widened to 31 cents from 29 cents over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 110.4% decline from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s actual.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Malibu Boats, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3><p>&nbsp;</p> <img alt="Malibu Boats, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="263" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/24/1724857245.png" title="" width="538" /> <p>Malibu Boats, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Malibu Boats, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">For net sales, the consensus mark is pegged at $155.4 million, indicating a decline of 58.3% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s figure of $372.3 million.</p><h2>Key Factors to Shape MBUU&rsquo;s Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Malibu Boats&rsquo; top line is expected to have declined year over year due to a fall in unit volumes across all reportable segments attributed to decreased wholesale shipments and increased dealer flooring program costs across all reportable segments. The softened retail demand environment, with notable weakness in the tow boat and value boat markets, is anticipated to have been discouraging for MBUU&rsquo;s prospects. Moreover, given the risky microenvironment, consumers have also been cautious toward discretionary spending.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Malibu, Saltwater Fishing and Cobalt segments&#39; net sales is pegged at $45.5 million, $67.2 million and $50.4 million, respectively, down from $160.3 million, $128.7 million and $83.3 million reported a year ago.<br /><br />Meanwhile, MBUU&rsquo;s bottom line is expected to have moved south year over year due to lower net sales and other associated costs given the ongoing inflationary environment. Also, the margins are expected to have been hurt by fixed-cost deleverage due to lower sales and increased dealer flooring program costs.</p><h2>What the Zacks Model Unveils</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Malibu Boats this time around. The company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients &mdash; a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) &mdash; to increase the odds of an earnings beat.<br /><br /><strong>Earnings ESP:</strong> MBUU has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank: </strong>The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can <strong>see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><h2>Recent Consumer Discretionary Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PENN Entertainment, Inc.</strong> PENN reported a narrower-than-expected loss in second-quarter 2024 results. The company&rsquo;s top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but declined on a year-over-year basis. PENN&#39;s quarterly results were hampered by disappointing performances of its South and Interactive segments.<br /><br />However, top-of-funnel growth improvement, better risk management and enhanced promotional strategies led to stronger-than-expected revenues and adjusted EBITDA in the Interactive segment. It continues to focus on database growth and enhancing engagement through the latest technology, ongoing investments in gaming and non-gaming areas, and partnerships in food and beverage.<br /><br /><strong>Choice Hotels International, Inc.</strong> CHH delivered lower-than-expected second-quarter 2024 results, with adjusted earnings and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, both metrics increased on a year-over-year basis.<br /><br />The quarter&rsquo;s results were backed by strong demand trends across the company&rsquo;s diversified portfolio of brands. This uptrend in demand aided in accelerating global hotel openings, expanding international market reach and increasing the size of its reward program. CHH&rsquo;s versatile business model and accretive growth strategies ensure the support required to foster its growth trends.<br /><br /><strong>Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.</strong> HLT reported second-quarter 2024 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. Both metrics increased year over year.<br /><br />The company&#39;s performance was backed by notable improvements in revenue per available room, attributed to higher occupancy rates and average daily rates. As of Jun. 30, 2024, Hilton&#39;s development pipeline comprised nearly 3,370 hotels, with almost 508,300 rooms across 136 countries and territories. For 2024, HLT expects net unit growth of 7-7.5%.<br /><br />Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328515/malibu-boats-gears-up-to-report-q4-earnings-what-to-expect?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2328515">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ J&J's Stock Up 12.8% in 3 Months: Time to Buy, Sell or Hold? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 17:12:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">In the past three months,<strong> J&amp;J</strong>&rsquo;s JNJ stock has risen 12.8% compared with an increase of 11.4% for the industry. J&amp;J has also outperformed the sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 in the same timeframe. J&amp;J&rsquo;s stock has also been trading above its 200-day and 50-day moving averages since mid-July.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">JNJ Stock Outperforms Industry, Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/37/75642.jpg?v=1634417761" style="height: 310px; width: 600px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the stock&rsquo;s outperformance was related to J&amp;J&rsquo;s strong second-quarter results, wherein it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. The stock&rsquo;s outperformance has sent investors wondering if this is the right time to invest in the stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We believe the focus of long-term investors should be on the company&rsquo;s strong fundamentals. Let&rsquo;s understand the company&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses to better analyze how to play the stock after the latest price increase.</p><h2>JNJ is the Most Diversified Drug Maker</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">J&amp;J&rsquo;s biggest strength is its diversified business model. In August 2023, J&amp;J separated its Consumer Health business into a newly listed company called <strong>Kenvue </strong>KVUE, which now operates as a separate and fully independent company. In mid-2024, J&amp;J exited its remaining 9.5% stake in Kenvue&rsquo;s common stock, bringing the separation to a close. J&amp;J has more than 275 subsidiaries, which clearly means that the business is extremely well-diversified. Its diversification helps it to withstand economic cycles more effectively. J&amp;J has 26 platforms with more than $1 billion in annual sales. It also has one of the largest R&amp;D budgets among pharma companies.</p><h2>JNJ&rsquo;s Innovative Medicines Unit Showing Consistent Strength</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">J&amp;J&rsquo;s Innovative Medicine (previously Pharmaceuticals) unit is performing at above-market levels. Its growth is being driven by existing products like Darzalex, Stelara, Tremfya, Uptravi and Erleada and also continued uptake of new launches, including Spravato, Carvykti and Tecvayli. J&amp;J has a goal of growing the Innovative Medicines unit into a $60 billion ($57 billion on a constant-currency basis) segment by 2025. The segment&rsquo;s sales rose 6.8% in 2022, 9% in 2023 and 5.3% in the first half of 2024 on an organic basis. In 2024, J&amp;J expects to record above-market growth in the Innovative Medicine unit for the 13th consecutive year. J&amp;J expects the Innovative Medicine business to grow 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, J&amp;J believes 10 of its new Innovative Medicine products have the potential to deliver peak non-risk adjusted operational sales of $5 billion, including new cancer drugs like Talvey and Tecvayli and pipeline candidates like nipocalimab and JNJ-2113.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">J&amp;J&rsquo;s legal and other troubles, however, are overshadowing its strengths. Let&rsquo;s discuss a few of them.</p><h2>J&amp;J&rsquo;s Legal Troubles Seem Neverending</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">J&amp;J faces a slew of lawsuits, which allege personal injuries to patients caused by the use of its medicines, mainly its talc products. J&amp;J faces more than 62,000 lawsuits for its talc-based products. The lawsuits allege that its talc products contain asbestos, which caused many women to develop ovarian cancer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">J&amp;J&rsquo;s subsidiary, LTL Management, which was established to manage claims in the cosmetic talc litigation, filed for voluntary bankruptcy twice to equitably resolve all present and future talc-related claims. However, both bankruptcy filings were rejected by courts, stating that J&amp;J was not in enough financial stress to qualify for bankruptcy. In May 2024, LTL Management proposed a new plan, committing to pay claimants a present value of approximately $6.5 billion or $8 billion nominally over 25 years, which could resolve 99.75% of all pending talc lawsuits against the company.</p><h2>Upcoming Patent Expiration of J&amp;J&rsquo;s Blockbuster Drug Stelara</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">J&amp;J will also face the patent expiration of the blockbuster drug Stelara in 2025. Stelara generated sales of $5.3 billion in the first half of 2024. The launch of generics could significantly erode the drug&rsquo;s sales and hurt J&amp;J&rsquo;s sales and profits. Stelara biosimilars are expected to be launched in the United States in 2025 while a biosimilar version of Stelara was launched in certain European markets for certain indications in July 2024.</p><h2>Slowing Sales in J&amp;J&rsquo;s MedTech Segment</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">While strong global procedure growth, new product uptake and commercial execution are contributing to the growth of J&amp;J&rsquo;s MedTech business, a weaker performance in China and competitive pressure in some categories in the United States is partially offsetting the growth. In the second quarter of 2024, sales in China were hurt by the impact of the volume-based procurement (VBP) program, the anti-corruption campaign and a difficult comparison to the year-ago quarter. VBP is a government-driven cost containment effort in China.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the second quarter, J&amp;J&rsquo;s MedTech growth fell below its expectations of being in the upper end of expected market growth of 5-7%. J&amp;J expects growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, J&amp;J expects MedTech growth closer to 6% for 2024, lower than the prior expectation of growing at the upper end of the market growth expectation of 5-7%.</p><h2>J&amp;J&rsquo;s Attractive Stock&rsquo;s Valuation, Declining Estimates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">From a valuation standpoint, J&amp;J appears attractive relative to the industry and is trading below its 5-year mean. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company shares currently trade at 15.61 forward earnings, lower than 20.53 for the industry and the stock&rsquo;s mean of 16.07.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">JNJ Stock Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/31/75643.jpg?v=1458666626" style="height: 310px; width: 600px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Following the earnings guidance cut due to costs related to recent acquisitions, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 as well as 2025 has gone down, as seen in the chart below.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">JNJ Estimate Movement</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9f/75641.jpg?v=439549110" style="height: 310px; width: 600px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">J&amp;J&rsquo;s Innovative Medicines segment is showing a growth trend. The company has an interesting R&amp;D pipeline that can generate innovative products and drive its growth further.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the softness in the MedTech unit, seen in the second quarter, is a concern. It remains to be seen if the trends improve in the second half. Also, Innovative Medicine sales growth is expected to be slightly lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half due to the entry of Stelara biosimilars in Europe. The company is likely to continue to incur billions of dollars for legal expenses in future quarters due to its pending lawsuits.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We suggest a new investor should avoid buying this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock right now due to uncertainty surrounding its legal battles and expectation of slower sales growth in the second half</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are several other large drugmakers that are generating better growth than J&amp;J and appear to be decent investment options. An investor interested in buying a large drugmaker may consider investing in <strong>Eli Lilly</strong> LLY instead, which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, those who already own J&amp;J&rsquo;s stock may stay invested for some time and see how its sales perform in the second half and if the company can manage to completely resolve its talc lawsuits.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328498/j-j-s-stock-up-12-8-in-3-months-time-to-buy-sell-or-hold?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2328498">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong> JNJ announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved its lung cancer drug Rybrevant (amivantamab) for expanded use.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The EC approved a type II extension of indication for Rybrevant in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed) for the treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 19 deletions&nbsp;after failure of prior therapy, including an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">JNJ&#39;s Stock Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of JNJ have increased 3.9% so far this year compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 27.1%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/da/75721.jpg?v=603323192" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">J&amp;J&#39;s MARIPOSA-2 Study Data</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The latest EC approval was based on data from the phase III MARIPOSA-2 study, which evaluated the safety and efficacy profile of the Rybrevant-chemotherapy combo in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR ex19del or L858R substitution NSCLC whose disease progressed on or after treatment with <strong>AstraZeneca</strong>&rsquo;s AZN blockbuster cancer drug Tagrisso (osimertinib).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Data from the study showed that treatment with Rybrevant plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 52% versus chemotherapy alone in the given patient population. Also, treatment with Rybrevant plus chemotherapy resulted in progression-free survival of 6.3 months compared to 4.2 months for chemotherapy alone &ndash; the primary endpoint of the study.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The approval in the EU was expected as the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency had recommended approval of the type II extension of indication of Rybrevant+ chemotherapy for the given patient population in July.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At present, Rybrevant is approved (conditional marketing authorization) in the EU for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rybrevant is also approved in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations in Europe.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Recent Developments Related to JNJ&#39;s Rybrevant</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this month, the FDA approved Rybrevant in combination with oral EGFR-TKI inhibitor, Lazcluze (lazertinib) as a first-line treatment for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This approval was based on data from the phase III MARIPOSA study, which evaluated the Rybrevant-Lazcluze combo against AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Tagrisso in the given patient population.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A regulatory filing is currently under review in the European Union seeking marketing authorization for a similar indication.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rybrevant in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin-pemetrexed) is currently under review in the United States as a treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR ex19del or L858R substitution mutations whose disease has progressed on or after receiving AZN&rsquo;s Tagrisso.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">J&amp;J is also seeking the FDA&rsquo;s approval for a subcutaneous formulation of Rybrevant for all currently approved or submitted indications of intravenous formulation of the drug.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">J&amp;J currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the biotech sector are <strong>Illumina, Inc.</strong> ILMN and <strong>Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc.</strong> FULC, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, estimates for Illumina&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share have moved up from $1.07 to $3.16. Earnings per share estimates for 2025 have improved from $2.93 to $4.50. Year to date, shares of ILMN have lost 6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ILMN&rsquo;s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 463.46%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, estimates for Fulcrum Therapeutics&rsquo; 2024 loss per share have narrowed from $1.24 to 48 cents. Loss per share estimates for 2025 have narrowed from $1.71 to $1.51. Year to date, shares of FULC have jumped 31.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">FULC&rsquo;s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 393.18%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328493/j-j-s-rybrevant-receives-eu-approval-for-expanded-use-in-nsclc?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_medical_sector-2328493">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Acadia Healthcare Expands Behavioral Health Services in Iowa ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.</strong> ACHC and Methodist Jennie Edmundson Hospital recently conducted a groundbreaking ceremony for a cutting-edge behavioral health hospital in Council Bluffs, IA. Plans to establish the hospital were announced in July 2023 as part of the joint-venture partnership between ACHC and Omaha-based Methodist Health System. The Methodist Jennie Edmundson Hospital is part of Methodist Health System.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The new facility will be named Methodist Jennie Edmundson Behavioral Health and is likely to commence operations in 2026. It will feature 96 inpatient beds, with 24 specifically designated for addressing the mental health needs of children and adolescents. It will also offer intensive outpatient services. The hospital will invest in cutting-edge technology and resources to enhance access to high-quality behavioral health services for patients dealing with acute mental health and substance use disorders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This, in turn, is expected to bring about improved health outcomes for residents of western Iowa and eastern Nebraska. Working closely with local organizations, hospitals and first responders of the two regions will enable the joint venture partners to better serve the targeted regions.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">A Time-Opportune Move on ACHC&rsquo;s Part</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Opening the Methodist Jennie Edmundson Behavioral Health Hospital is likely to be a time-opportune move considering the dire need for acute and intensive outpatient behavioral health services across the Council Bluffs community. According to the American Hospital Directory, there remains a shortage of more than 300 inpatient behavioral health beds in Iowa and Nebraska, which further substantiates the timeliness of the recent move.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Benefits to Acadia Healthcare</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">New facilities resulting from joint ventures offer a means for ACHC to serve a greater number of patients and earn more revenues.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Acadia Healthcare often resorts to buyouts or joint ventures with renowned U.S. health systems to inaugurate new hospitals or expand existing facilities through bed additions. Its healthcare portfolio comprised 258 behavioral healthcare facilities across 38 states and Puerto Rico as of June 30, 2024. Management anticipates adding more than 400 beds to existing facilities in 2024.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ACHC Stock&rsquo;s Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Acadia Healthcare have gained 19.2% in the past month compared with the industry&rsquo;s 8.5% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/4d/75809.jpg?v=356746199" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ACHC currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the Medical space are <strong>LeMaitre Vascular, Inc. </strong>LMAT, <strong>Avanos Medical, Inc. </strong>AVNS and <strong>The Ensign Group, Inc.</strong> ENSG.

<![CDATA[ ILMN's TSO Comprehensive IVD Test Secures FDA Approval as CDx ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:59:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Illumina, Inc.&nbsp;</strong>ILMN has secured the FDA&rsquo;s approval for its in vitro diagnostic (IVD) TruSight Oncology (TSO) Comprehensive test and first two companion diagnostic (CDx) indications. The test analyses more than 500 genes to profile a patient&#39;s solid tumor, improving the chances of identifying an immuno-oncology or clinically actionable biomarkers that enable targeted therapy options or clinical trial enrollment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The latest development marks a long-awaited milestone for the company&rsquo;s oncology customers and community. In Europe, a separate CE-marked version of TSO Comprehensive has been available since its launch in 2022.&nbsp;</p><h2>Role of ILMN&rsquo;s TSO Comprehensive Test as a CDx</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A CDx test can reveal whether a patient&#39;s tumor has a specific gene change or biomarker that can be targeted by a therapy, helping to determine if a patient should receive the treatment. Illumina&rsquo;s TSO Comprehensive is FDA-approved as a CDx to identify adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors who are positive for neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusions that may benefit from treatment with Bayer&#39;s VITRAKVI (larotrectinib). VITRAKVI is a highly selective TRK inhibitor approved for use in patients with TRK fusion cancer, in accordance with therapeutic labeling.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NTRK gene fusions are rare across most solid cancer tumor types (~0.1%&ndash;0.3%) and can be challenging to detect, given that these genes can fuse with different partners, many of which were previously unknown. TSO Comprehensive interrogates ribonucleic acid and can identify a broad range of known and novel gene fusion partners across all three NTRK gene fusions, NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Most CDx tests are specific to one type of cancer, however, TSO Comprehensive is approved for use across solid tumor indications for the NTRK CDx. This helps to maximize the chances of finding actionable information from each patient&#39;s biopsy.</p><h2>Importance of ILMN&rsquo;s TSO Comprehensive in NSCLC Treatment</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The test is also approved to identify adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that may benefit from treatment with Eli Lilly&#39;s RETEVMO (selpercatinib) &mdash; a highly selective and potent RET kinase inhibitor in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6a/75694.jpg?v=224811459" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As one of the most common types of lung cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, NSCLC has an expansive actionable biomarker landscape. This has driven the need for broad molecular profiling to better understand the patient&#39;s disease and guide clinical management. The oncogenic activation of RET fusion-positive NSCLC by gene fusions is a primary driver in NSCLC, occurring in up to 2% of cases.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TSO Comprehensive enables broad characterization and simultaneous detection of multiple prognostic and predictive biomarkers such as RET, genomic signatures such as tumor mutational burden and emerging biomarkers within NSCLC in a single test.</p><h2>Collaborations Boost Illumina&rsquo;s Cancer Efforts</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Illumina&rsquo;s partnerships with industry leaders like Bayer and Lilly are crucial to advancing cancer diagnostics and expanding access to precision oncology for more patients. The company is developing a pipeline of CDx claims through partnerships with pharmaceutical companies, which will be added to TSO Comprehensive following appropriate regulatory approvals. These CDx claims will help unlock groundbreaking targeted therapies and immunotherapies to benefit cancer patients.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TSO Comprehensive will start shipping to customers this year. Comprehensive genomic profiling assays with CDx claims for solid tumors, like TSO Comprehensive, are reimbursable under Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Service national coverage determination.</p><h2>Industry Prospects Favors Illumina</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per a Grand View Research report, the global oncology CDx market was valued at $4.78 billion in 2023 and projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7% by 2030.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The market is growing due to the increasing prevalence of cancer, the growing adoption of CDx and a rising emphasis on personalized medicine. The need for early cancer detection tests, which can help improve disease management &amp; reduce mortality, is expected to propel the overall market growth.</p><h2>Illumina&rsquo;s Recent Developments</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this month, the company expanded its oncology menu for the NovaSeq X Series customers with the high-throughput version of TruSight Oncology 500 and the latest version of its distributed liquid biopsy research assay, TruSight Oncology 500 ctDNA v2. These assays enable labs to confidently expand oncology testing research of tissue and liquid biopsy samples, with new transformative sequencing economics, faster sequencing run times and broader batch sizes on the NovaSeq X Series for the first time.</p><h2>ILMN Stock Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past year, ILMN shares have lost 17.2% compared with the industry&rsquo;s decline of 2.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 30 days, Illumina&rsquo;s 2024 estimated earnings have surged nearly 94% to $3.16 per share. The stock has beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 463.5%.</p><h2>ILMN&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Other Top MedTech Stocks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Illumina currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are <strong>Exact Sciences </strong>EXAS, <strong>Boston Scientific </strong>BSX and <strong>SiBone</strong> SIBN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Exact Sciences&rsquo; shares have lost 25.2% in the past year. Estimates for the company&rsquo;s loss per share have improved from $1.09 to 95 cents in 2024 and from 26 cents to 6 cents in 2025 in the past 30 days. EXAS&rsquo; earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and matched in one, delivering an average surprise of 56.2%. In the last reported quarter, it posted an earnings surprise of 75.7%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Estimates for Boston Scientific&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share have moved to $2.40 from $2.36 in the past 30 days. Shares of the company have gained 48.1% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 13.9%. BSX&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.2%. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 6.9%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Estimates for SiBone&rsquo;s 2024 loss per share have narrowed to 89 cents from 95 cents in the past 30 days. Shares of the company have lost 23% in the past year against the industry&rsquo;s 11.4% growth. SIBN&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 13.4%. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 15.4%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328511/ilmn-s-tso-comprehensive-ivd-test-secures-fda-approval-as-cdx?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_medical_sector-2328511">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Old Second Bancorp to Acquire First Merchants' 5 Branches in Illinois ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Old Second Bancorp, Inc.</strong> OSBC signed an agreement with First Merchants Corp. to acquire five Illinois branches alongside certain branch-specific loans and deposits. These branches are located in Southeast Chicago MSA.</p><h2>Details of the Acquisition by Old Second Bancorp</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">OSBC will pay a total cash consideration of roughly $23 million, equivalent to a 7.5% deposit premium to First Merchants. The company expects to assume roughly $304 million in deposits and almost $12 million in loans associated with these branches.<br /><br />The deal is expected to be completed by 2024-end, subject to regulatory approvals. Until then, these five branches will continue to operate under First Merchants&rsquo; name. These will be rebranded as Old Second Bancorp&rsquo;s branches immediately upon closure of the transaction.</p><h2>OSBC&rsquo;s Strategic Rationale Behind the Deal</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The acquisition is expected to strengthen OSBC&rsquo;s status as one of the largest banks headquartered in Chicagoland and significantly expand its existing branch network, specifically in the Southeast Chicago market.<br /><br />For First Merchants, this divestiture completes its branch exit from suburban Chicago markets.<br /><br />This move aligns with Old Second Bancorp&rsquo;s inorganic growth strategy to deepen its presence in the Illinois market. In December 2021, the company acquired West Suburban Bancorp, Inc. to enhance its presence in the west suburban Chicago area. The deal comprised the buyout of 34 branches with a retail and commercial client mix of loans and deposits.</p><h2>Zacks Rank &amp; Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date, shares of Old Second Bancorp have risen 7.3% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 14% growth.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d3/75770.jpg?v=1648470476" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Currently, OSBC carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).<br />&nbsp;<br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Similar Steps by Other Financial Services Firms</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this month, <strong>State Street Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s STT asset management unit, State Street Global Advisors, announced an investment in a leading Australian fintech platform, Raiz Invest Limited. As part of the equity investment agreement, State Street Global Advisors will acquire 5% of Raiz&rsquo;s share capital through a placement.<br /><br />Through this partnership, State Street Global Advisors&rsquo; trusted brand and deep knowledge of markets will come together with Raiz&rsquo;s mobile-first platform, which will help retail investors in Australia with micro-investments primarily in exchange-traded funds and model portfolios.<br /><br /><strong>U.S. Bancorp</strong>&rsquo;s USB lead banking division, U.S. Bank, expanded its focus on the healthcare industry with the acquisition of Salucro Healthcare Solutions LLC. The buyout was completed on Aug. 21, 2024. The financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.<br /><br />Based in Tempe, AZ, Salucro is a provider of healthcare financial technology with a primary focus on patient payments and billing. Previously, Salucro had been a partner of Elavon, a subsidiary of U.S. Bank. In 2022, U.S. Bank made its initial investment in Salucro, and its platform was sold through Elavon as MedEpay.<br /><br />The acquisition of Salucro extends U.S. Bank&#39;s more than a century of service to healthcare-focused clientele. Following the acquisition, Salucro&rsquo;s employees have now become part of U.S. Bank and will be integrated into Elavon, one of the largest global payments processing firms.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328487/old-second-bancorp-to-acquire-first-merchants-5-branches-in-illinois?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_finance_sector-2328487">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Tenet Stock Rises 24.6% in 3 Months: Is This Your Buy Signal? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tenet Healthcare Corporation </strong>THC shares have returned 24.6% in the past three months, outperforming both the hospital industry and the S&amp;P 500 Index. Over this timeframe, the industry and the S&amp;P 500 Indexhave gained 20.8% and 6.4%, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently priced at $163.87, the stock is just 1% below its 52-week high. This proximity underscores investor confidence and market optimism about this hospital company&rsquo;s prospects. Moreover, the stock is trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, signaling strong upward momentum.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">3-Month Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/02/75772.jpg?v=812194338" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Decoding THC&rsquo;s Bright Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The growing senior population and increasing prevalence of diseases are expected to drive long-term demand for hospital services. Tenet Healthcare is well-positioned to benefit from this trend through strategic acquisitions and the development of new facilities. These expansion efforts aim to help Tenet capture more market share in a highly fragmented healthcare market, which will boost its adjusted admissions, emergency room visits and hospital surgeries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Improving labor market conditions and effective staffing solutions are allowing the company to hire more workers and reopen services that were earlier shut down due to pandemic-related challenges. This increased capacity is expected to meet the rising demand for healthcare services. The company&#39;s strong second-quarter results reflect this positive growth trend.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tenet&rsquo;s robust Q2 performance led it to raise its 2024 forecast. Net operating revenues from the Hospital segment are now expected to be between $16.3 billion and $16.5 billion, up from the previous range of $15.9 billion to $16.1 billion. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA is now projected to be between $3.825 billion and $3.975 billion, compared to the earlier estimate of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">THC&rsquo;s Strategic Efforts</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">By the end of the second quarter, Tenet had stakes in 520 ambulatory surgery centers and 24 surgical hospitals. The company expects its transformative efforts to boost margins and free cash flow while creating a diversified business mix that can thrive in any political or regulatory environment. This approach will help reduce risks for investors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tenet Healthcare is focusing more on ambulatory surgery centers to tap into the rising demand for outpatient services. By leveraging its partnership with United Surgical Partners International, the company aims to expand its network, enhance operational efficiency, and improve profit margins.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strategic investments in artificial intelligence-enabled technologies are set to enhance both clinical and administrative workflows, boosting overall efficiency. These advancements will likely reduce costs, shorten patient wait times and significantly improve the patient experience.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Alongside favorable industry trends, THC&rsquo;s focus on operational efficiency and rising net revenue per caseare expected to drive further profit growth, which is reflected by the revised estimates. Also, it doesn&rsquo;t shy away from divesting non-core and unprofitable business units to repay debt, maintain financial liquidity and make higher-return investments.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Estimate Revision Favoring THC Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Reflecting the positive sentiment around Tenet, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has seen upward revisions. The consensus estimate for 2024 adjusted earnings for THC is currently pegged at $10.70 per share, indicating a 53.3% year-over-year surge. The consensus mark for 2025 suggests a further 2.4% jump. It beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 58.5%. The consensus estimate for 2024 and 2025 revenues suggests 1.4% and 3.8% year-over-year growth, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ae/75774.jpg?v=1359469431" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">THC: A Value-Driven Choice</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the recent growth in stock price, Tenet is trading at a discount compared to the industry average. It presents a compelling investment opportunity with its attractive forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 15.07X, lower than the industry average of 16.19X. The company has a Value Score of A.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3c/75775.jpg?v=344075325" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In comparison, its peers like <strong>HCA Healthcare, Inc.</strong> HCA and <strong>Universal Health Services, Inc.</strong> UHS are currently trading at forward 12-month price-to-earnings of 16.43X and 13.91X, respectively.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Final Verdict: Buy THC Now</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">With the stock currently trading at a discount and benefiting from efficiency-enhancing initiatives and favorable industry trends, Tenet appears to have significant growth potential. Investors may consider accumulating more shares, as improving labor market conditions and higher admissions are expected to provide additional support for growth. The upward revisions in estimates are suggesting a promising outlook ahead.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As such, Tenet currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

It is making concerted efforts to deliver the GenAI experience across its products and services with the integration of Gemini.<br /><br />GOOGL is experiencing strong contributions from its AI investments. As of June 2024, more than 1.5 million developers are using Gemini.<br /><br />However, increasing investment expenses, litigation issues associated with its AI technology, market uncertainties and rising competition in the GenAI space are concerning for GOOGL.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">GOOGL Stock Beats Industry YTD</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b6/75802.jpg?v=1598163269" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the combination of risks and rewards, the question arising in investors&#39; minds is whether the stock can improve from the current level or has reached the top. To answer this, let us delve deeper into the fundamental aspects of the company.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">GenAI Innovations &amp; Integrations Boost GOOGL&rsquo;s Prospects</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Alphabet Google&rsquo;s Gemini comes in four sizes, forming a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything, from data centers to devices. Each model of this family is designed for various use cases. With Gemini, Google offers the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date.<br /><br />The company is also gaining traction among various enterprises with its enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool, Gemini Code Assist.<br /><br />GOOGL recently introduced a Gemini-powered summarize feature in Gmail for Android. This GenAI-backed feature is useful in summarizing long newsletters in Gmail. Users can recap conversations in Gmail with the &ldquo;Summarize this email&rdquo; option.<br /><br />The introduction of Gemma 2, which is a lightweight open model available in 9B and 27B parameter sizes, aiming to accelerate AI deployment and innovations across various enterprises, is noteworthy.<br /><br />The launch of the expanding global footprint of its GenAI-powered note-taking app, NotebookLM, is another positive. It is available in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, the U.K., and 208 more countries and territories.<br /><br />Solid momentum in Google&rsquo;s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is a plus. Google added Anthropic&rsquo;s newly released model, called Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to Vertex AI.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alphabet offers an advanced image generation model, namely Imagen 3, in preview for Vertex AI customers with early access.<br /><br />The integration of the GenAI technology into the search engine to drive the company&rsquo;s search momentum is noteworthy. LLMs, coupled with multi-search and visual exploration features, are continuously improving search results.<br /><br />The Search Generative Experience (&ldquo;SGE&rdquo;), which leverages GenAI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is boosting the search traffic on the company&rsquo;s search platform.<br /><br />Coming to the advertisement business, Alphabet&rsquo;s growing efforts to deliver better performance and profitability to advertisers on the back of foundational research models and LLMs are positive.<br /><br />SGE is significantly benefiting the advertisement business as it can create relevant, customized and high-quality ads. The strength in the conversational experience of Google Ads and Performance Max is driving the company&rsquo;s momentum among advertisers.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rising Estimates Reflect Upside Potential in GOOGL Stock</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Alphabet&rsquo;s long-term prospects are expected to benefit from its growing GenAI innovations and product integrations. The company&rsquo;s strong efforts to strengthen Google Cloud, Search and YouTube with its GenAI capabilities will drive its top-line growth in the long run and allow it to enjoy economies of scale. Investors are optimistic about this fact which is reflected in the upward revision of earnings estimates.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $296.53 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 15.6%.&nbsp;<br /><br />The same for 2024 earnings stands at $7.63 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 31.6%. The EPS estimate has moved north by a penny over the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/e9/75804.jpg?v=538288385" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">GOOGL Stock Overvalued</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the GOOGL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Style Score of C suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.<br /><br />Alphabet is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 6.36X compared with the industry&rsquo;s 5.36X, which suggests that investors should wait for a better entry point.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/0c/75803.jpg?v=1504038811" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">GOOGL Trading Below Key Moving Average</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Adding to investors&rsquo; concerns, Alphabet shares have dipped below their 50-day moving average, a technical indicator often seen as a bearish signal. This movement suggests that the short-term prospects of GOOGL are somewhat foggy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/71/75805.jpg?v=2085557714" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Intensifying Competition Poses Risks</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Alphabet faces significant competition in the booming GenAI market from the likes of <strong>Microsoft </strong>MSFT and <strong>Amazon </strong>AMZN, which are leaving no stone unturned to boost their GenAI-powered offerings.<br /><br />Microsoft continues to make strong efforts to boost its generative AI capabilities. Its integration of GPT-4 into its search engine Bing and browser Edge to deliver a ChatGPT-like experience to users is noteworthy. Growing momentum across Azure OpenAI and Copilots has turned out to be a game changer.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Amazon is riding on Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Alphabet&rsquo;s AI push is hard to ignore. Its long-term growth story and upward estimate revision are compelling.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, macroeconomic headwinds, intensifying competition, lofty valuation and mounting expenses suggest that now may not be the ideal time to buy GOOGL stock aggressively.&nbsp;<br /><br />For current shareholders, holding on to the stock seems prudent, as the company&rsquo;s fundamental strengths and growth drivers are intact. However, new investors should consider waiting for a more attractive entry point.<br /><br />Currently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ Neogen Suffers From Competitive Pressure, Macroeconomic Woes ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Neogen</strong>&#39;s NEOG vast international trade is impacted by global macroeconomic issues. Also, a tough competitive landscape weighs on the stock. NEOG stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Neogen&rsquo;s international business continues to be affected by currency movements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The current macroeconomic environment has adversely impacted Neogen&rsquo;s financial operations. Governments and insurance companies continue to look for ways to contain the rising cost of healthcare. This might put pressure on players in the healthcare industry, with Neogen being no exception.&nbsp; Although the company is gradually coming out of the impact of the two-and-a-half-year-long pandemic, deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to a tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, and a higher interest rate have put the medical device space in a tight spot.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With sustained macroeconomic pressure, the company may struggle to keep its cost of revenues and operating expenses in check. In fiscal 2024, sales and marketing expenses rose 29.5% year over year. Our model forecasts a 1.5% rise in the metric for fiscal 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further, Neogen faces intense competition from companies ranging from small businesses to divisions of large multinational companies. Some of these organizations have substantially greater financial resources than the company. Historically, Neogen has faced intense competition resulting from the development of new technologies by the company&rsquo;s competitors, which could affect the marketability and profitability of Neogen&rsquo;s products.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors That May Offset the Risks for NEOG Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Neogen is progressing well in terms of picking the right growth markets and gaining a bigger share of those markets. In the fiscal fourth quarter, the Indicator Testing, Culture Media &amp; Other product categories benefited from double-digit growth in the Petrifilm product line as well as solid growth in culture media and food quality nutritional analysis. Additionally, the Vet Instruments and Disposables product line witnessed solid core growth. In the Animal care and other product category, core growth was led by higher sales of vitamin injectables and Biologics products.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Neogen Corporation Price</h2> <img alt="Neogen Corporation Price" height="251" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/a6/1724841357.png" title="" width="538" /> <p>Neogen Corporation price | Neogen Corporation Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Neogen also continues to carry out its strong R&amp;D activities. During the fiscal fourth quarter, Neogen&rsquo;s R&amp;D expenses totaled $5.1 million, up sequentially 4.1%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company is expanding well in other geographies. The company is seeing double-digit sales growth in Latin America, with strong performance across most key product categories.&nbsp; The business in Europe and Asia Pacific grew in low single digits and mid-single digits, respectively, with strength in Culture media, Petrifilm, General Sanitation and Sample Handling.</p><h2>Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are <strong>Intuitive Surgical</strong> ISRG, <strong>TransMedics Group </strong>TMDX and <strong>Boston Scientific </strong>BSX. While Intuitive Surgical and TransMedics sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, Boston Scientific currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Intuitive Surgical&rsquo;s shares have surged 55.4% in the past year. Estimates for the company&rsquo;s earnings have remained constant at $6.67 per share for 2024 in the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ISRG&rsquo;s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 8.97%. In the last reported quarter, it posted an earnings surprise of 16.34%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Estimates for TransMedics&rsquo; 2024 earnings per share (EPS) have moved up 48.1% to $1.20 in the past 30 days. Shares of the company have risen 174.1% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s 9.2% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TMDX&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 287.50%. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 66.67%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Estimates for Boston Scientific&rsquo;s 2024 EPS have increased 1.7% to $2.40 in the past 30 days. In the past year, shares of BSX have risen 46% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 9.2% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the last reported quarter, BSX delivered an earnings surprise of 6.90%. BSX&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.18%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328483/neogen-suffers-from-competitive-pressure-macroeconomic-woes?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|zer_report_update-2328483">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Units of <strong>Energy Transfer LP</strong> ET have rallied 21.8% year to date compared with its industry&rsquo;s growth of 20.8%. The oil and gas midstream firm owns a wide network of pipelines across the United States and is pursuing opportunities to serve growing power loads from new demand centers across its network.<br /><br />The firm is also a top exporter of liquefied petroleum gas and is working to expand natural gas liquids (NGL) export facilities to cater to the rising demand for NGL globally.<br /><br />The ET stock has also outperformed its sector and the S&amp;P 500 in the year-to-date period.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price Performance YTD</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7d/75798.jpg?v=1372600074" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Factors Acting as Tailwinds for ET Stock</h2><p>Energy Transfer owns more than 130,000 miles of pipelines across the United States and is expanding its operation through organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions. ET&rsquo;s operations are spread across 44 states. The firm has been making one large accretive acquisition each year since 2021. The WTG acquisition closed earlier this year expanded ET&rsquo;s natural gas pipeline and processing network in the Permian Basin.<br /><br />Energy Transfer has a well-balanced asset mix that provides strong earnings support. ET&rsquo;s oil and gas pipelines, gathering and processing, and storage assets are spread in major U.S. basins and growing demand markets. The firm will invest $3-3.2 billion in 2024 to further expand and strengthen its asset base.<br /><br />Energy Transfer has a NGL and Crude oil export capacity of more than 1.1 million barrels per day and 1.9 million barrels, respectively. The firm is working to increase its NGL export capabilities through the expansion of Marcus Hook and Nederland export terminals. The company&rsquo;s market share of worldwide NGL exports remains around 20%.</p><h2>Management Ownership in ET Rises</h2><p>ET&rsquo;s management and insiders own a sizeable chunk of its units. Management members and independent board members continue to purchase units of the firm. Energy Transfer insiders bought more than 44 million units worth $468 million since January 2021. The increasing ownership of insiders indicates bright prospects and sustainable growth amid the rising demand in the midstream space.</p><h2>ET&rsquo;s Earnings Estimates Suggest Y/Y Rise</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Energy Transfer&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings per unit indicates year-over-year growth of 28.4% and 12.6%, respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/60/75799.jpg?v=623562437" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><br />ET&rsquo;s Units are Undervalued<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Energy Transfer units are somewhat inexpensive on a relative basis, with its current trailing 12-month Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) being 10.32 compared with the industry average of 11.62.</p><p>Another firm operating in this space, <strong>Plains All American Pipeline</strong> PAA, is also trading at a discount on an EV/EBITDA basis compared with its industry.</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d2/75800.jpg?v=1521552114" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Summing Up<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Entergy Transfer, with more than 130,000 miles of pipeline and related infrastructure in 44 states, is poised well to benefit from the improving oil, natural gas and NGL production volumes in the United States.<br /><br />This can be a favorable entry point for investors, given the positive movement in earnings estimates and the firm trading at a discount. The increasing insider ownership in the firm also signals sustainable growth.<br /><br />Those who already own this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock would do well to retain it in their portfolios.<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328506/energy-transfer-stock-price-increases-21-8-ytd-how-to-play-it-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2328506">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GitLab</strong> GTLB shares have plunged 25.3% year to date (YTD), underperforming the Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector&rsquo;s growth of 21.7% and the Zacks Internet Software industry&rsquo;s return of 14.5%.&nbsp;<br /><br />The underperformance in GitLab shares can be attributed to modest top-line growth expectations in fiscal 2025 due to the challenging macroeconomic environment. It also includes a $4 million headwind related to GTLB&rsquo;s stand-alone selling price analysis.&nbsp;<br /><br />Although the latest products like GitLab Duo and GitLab Duo Pro bode well for GTLB&rsquo;s prospects, meaningful contribution is expected to take some time amid stiff competition.<br /><br />Hence, a dip in GTLB&rsquo;s share price brings this question into investors&rsquo; minds - is it the right time to jump into the stock or should we wait for a better entry point?</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">YTD Performance</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/04/75793.jpg?v=1543651089" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Strong Portfolio Boosts GitLab Stocks Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />GitLab&rsquo;s total addressable market is estimated to be $40 billion. It has been winning accolades due to a robust pipeline. Gartner, in its 2024 Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assiatants, put GitLab in the Leader quadrant.<br /><br />GitLab is leveraging AI to boost the potency of its portfolio. It has introduced AI throughout the entire software development cycle that improves productivity and security without sacrificing speed. Customers are fast adopting its AI offerings Gitlab Duo and GitLab Duo Pro.&nbsp;<br /><br />The company recently strengthened its portfolio with the launch of the GitLab Duo Enterprise add-on, which is charged at $39 per user per month for Ultimate customers. Ultimate accounted for 46% of GitLab&rsquo;s total Annual Run Rate.<br /><br />GitLab&rsquo;s prospects ride on an expanding clientele, driven by the strong adoption of its DevSecOps platform. Its strong partner base, which includes cloud service platforms like <strong>Alphabet</strong> GOOGL and <strong>Amazon</strong> AMZN, is helping the company rapidly expand its footprint among large enterprise customers.</p><h2>Expanding Clientele Aids GTLB&rsquo;s Top Line</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />GitLab has more than 30 million registered users on its platform. More than 50% of Fortune 100 are GitLab customers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Customers with more than $5K of Annual Recurring Revenues (ARR) increased 21% year over year to 8,976 in first-quarter fiscal 2025. Customers with more than $100K of ARR jumped 35% year over year to 1,025. Moreover, the dollar-based Net Retention Rate was 129% in the reported quarter.<br /><br />GitLab&rsquo;s robust portfolio has been driving clientele expansion. Enterprises, including <strong>NVIDIA</strong> NVDA and Google Cloud, have adopted GitLab&rsquo;s solutions to accelerate AI development and streamline security.<br /><br />NVIDIA chose GitLab Geo to address scalability and security concerns. It lets NVIDIA&#39;s remote teams work more efficiently and effectively by shortening the time taken to clone and manage projects.<br /><br />GitLab and Alphabet have collaborated to integrate GitLab&rsquo;s unique capabilities within Google Cloud. The collaboration combined GitLab&rsquo;s source code management, planning, CI/CD workflow, enhanced security and compliance capabilities with Google&#39;s Cloud console and Artifact Registry&rsquo;s single data plane. This integration is currently in public beta.</p><h2>GTLB&rsquo;s Earnings Estimate Shows Upward Trend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, GitLab expects revenues between $176 million and $177 million, indicating a growth rate of 26-27% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second quarter revenues is pegged at $176.48 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.44%.<br /><br />GTLB expects non-GAAP earnings between 9 cents and 10 cents per share. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 10 cents per share, up by a penny over the past 60 days.<br /><br />For fiscal 2025, GitLab expects revenues between $733 million and $737 million, indicating a growth rate of 26-27% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $735.26 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.79%.<br />&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">GitLab Inc.

<![CDATA[ Fidelity National's Stock Lags Industry: Is it a Hold or Fold? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:50:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <strong>Fidelity National Financial </strong>FNF have gained 14.5% year to date, underperforming the industry&rsquo;s increase of 28.1% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s increase of 18% in the said time frame.<br /><br />The bottom line of FNF has continually dropped from 2021 to 2023, declining 77.4%. Revenues declined 24.9% from 2021 to 2023. Earnings per share (EPS) missed the consensus estimate in the last two reported quarters of 2024.<br /><br />Fidelity National&rsquo;s transaction volumes were affected as U.S. home sales suffered due to higher mortgage rates. FNF&rsquo;s refinance orders opened per day declined 1% year over year in the second quarter of 2024. However, the average rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.47% as of Aug. 8 from 6.73% a week ago, a positive development for the housing market.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, an interest rate cut is likely in the September FOMC, with chances of more later this year. FNF stated that every 25-basis point decrease in Fed funds is expected to result in an approximate $15 million annualized decline in its interest and investment income.<br /><br />Notes payable increased 7.4% as of June 30, 2024. Its leverage of 52.3 deteriorated 182 basis points. Leverage in the trailing 12-month compared unfavorably with the industry average of 1.4. Times interest earned too compared unfavorably with the industry average.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">FNF Lags Industry and S&amp;P</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/cc/75740.jpg?v=28210695" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Factors Favoring FNF Stock</h2><p>Fidelity National has a market-leading position in residential purchase, refinance and commercial markets. This, in turn, provides a scale advantage to the title insurer. Real estate-related businesses complement its core title business. Its scale and volume fuel revenues and lower costs provide a competitive advantage. The title insurer&rsquo;s strategic move to buy F&amp;G Annuities &amp; Life, a leading provider of annuity and life insurance concentrated in the middle-income market with a diversified growth strategy, shields it from the volatility integral to the core title insurance business.&nbsp;<br /><br />Solid retail annuity sales and F&amp;G&#39;s presence in institutional markets benefit assets under management. F&amp;G invests in a high-quality and well-diversified portfolio and its average assets under management growth drives earnings.<br /><br />In tandem with accelerated digitalization taking place in the industry, Fidelity National too is investing in technology to widen its market-leading position.<br /><br />Banking on operational expertise, FNF has a solid capital position that supports wealth distribution, mergers and acquisitions, organic growth initiatives and debt payments.<br /><br />It carries a VGM Score of A. VGM Score helps identify stocks with the most attractive value, best growth and the most promising momentum.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fidelity National&rsquo;s Favorable Return on Equity&nbsp;</h2><p>FNF&rsquo;s return on equity in the trailing 12 months was 9.5%, better than the industry average of 6.2%, reflecting efficiency in utilizing shareholders&rsquo; funds.</p><h2>FNF&rsquo;s Growth Projection&nbsp;</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FNF&rsquo;s 2024 earnings is pegged at $4.58, indicating a 29% increase from the year-ago reported figure on 9.9% higher revenues of $12.9 billion. The consensus estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $5.63, indicating a 23.1% increase year over year on 9.2% higher revenues of $14.1 billion. The company has a Growth Score of B.&nbsp;</p><h2>FNF&rsquo;s Dividend History Impressive</h2><p>FNF&rsquo;s distribution of wealth to shareholders via dividend hikes is impressive. Fidelity National has increased dividends at a 10-year CAGR of 9.7%. The dividend yield is 3.3%, better than the industry average of 0.3%.</p><p>FNF&rsquo;s dividend yield betters other industry players like <strong>Stewart Information Services </strong>STC and <strong>Old Republic International </strong>ORI.</p><h2>To Conclude</h2><p>FNF is set to grow on its market-leading position, higher direct premiums, agency premiums, strong origination demand and effective capital deployment. Being the nation&rsquo;s largest title insurance company, Fidelity National should benefit from solid long-term fundamentals for U.S. residential and commercial real estate markets, given its largest &amp; deepest real estate data networks. It is, therefore, wise to hold on to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.</p><p>You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328481/fidelity-national-s-stock-lags-industry-is-it-a-hold-or-fold?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2328481">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Merck</strong> MRK announced that it has initiated a phase III called Shorespan-007 study on its lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor, bomedemstat, for the treatment of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) who have previously not received cytoreductive therapy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The pivotal phase III study is evaluating bomedemstat versus hydroxyurea, the current standard of care chemotherapy, for treating patients with ET, a chronic, rare blood disorder that is the most common type of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The study will enroll approximately 300 patients globally.The primary endpoint of the study is to check the durable clinicohematologic response rate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Merck have increased 6.9% so far this year compared with the industry&rsquo;s rise of 27.1%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/80/75724.jpg?v=861118004" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Which Studies are Ongoing on MRK&#39;s Bomedemstat?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Bomedemstat is also being evaluated in the phase III Shorespan-006 study for treating patients with ET who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also, multiple separate phase II studies are ongoing, which are evaluating bomedemstat either as a monotherapy or in combination for treating a wide range of MPNs such as ET, myelofibrosis (MF) and polycythemia vera (PV).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Bomedemstat was added to Merck&rsquo;s portfolio with the 2022 acquisition of Imago BioSciences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The FDA has granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track Designations to bomedemstat for the treatment of ET and MF, while the European Medicines Agency has granted Priority Medicines scheme designation to bomedemstat for MF.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The investigational LSD1 inhibitor, bomedemstat also enjoys an Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per the company, less than 200,000 people suffer from ET in the United States, and the standard of care has remained unchanged for decades. As a result, the successful development of bomedemstat provides hope for a new treatment option that has the potential to improve disease control as well as the quality of life.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the biotech sector are <strong>Illumina, Inc.</strong> ILMN, <strong>Krystal Biotech, Inc.</strong> KRYS and <strong>Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc.</strong> FULC, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, estimates for Illumina&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share have moved up from $1.07 to $3.16. Earnings per share estimates for 2025 have improved from $2.93 to $4.50. Year to date, shares of ILMN have lost 6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ILMN&rsquo;s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 463.46%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, estimates for Krystal Biotech&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share have increased from $1.98 to $2.38. Earnings per share estimates for 2025 have improved from $4.33 to $7.31. Year to date, shares of KRYS have rallied 59.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">KRYS&rsquo; earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters while missing on the remaining occasion, the average surprise being 45.95%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, estimates for Fulcrum Therapeutics&rsquo; 2024 loss per share have narrowed from $1.24 to 48 cents. Loss per share estimates for 2025 have narrowed from $1.71 to $1.51.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.</p><p>In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.</p><p>However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.</p><p>TransDigm Group (TDG) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.</p><p>Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.</p><p>Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this aircraft components maker a great growth pick right now.</p><p><h2>Earnings Growth</h2></p><p>Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors.

The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 16.4%.</p><p><h2>Cash Flow Growth</h2></p><p>Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.</p><p>Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for TransDigm is 47.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 6.3%.</p><p>While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 5.4%.</p><p><h2>Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions</h2></p><p>Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions.

Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>The current-year earnings estimates for TransDigm have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.2% over the past month.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made TransDigm a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.</p><p>You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p>This combination positions TransDigm well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328474/transdigm-tdg-is-an-incredible-growth-stock-3-reasons-why?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_11_growth-2328474">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.</p><p>In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.</p><p>However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.</p><p>Hamilton Lane (HLNE) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.</p><p>Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.</p><p>While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this private-market investment firm is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:</p><p><h2>Earnings Growth</h2></p><p>Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.</p><p>While the historical EPS growth rate for Hamilton Lane is 18.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 24.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 12.6%.</p><p><h2>Cash Flow Growth</h2></p><p>While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.</p><p>Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Hamilton Lane is 17.5%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -4.6%.</p><p>While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.9% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6%.</p><p><h2>Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions</h2></p><p>Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>The current-year earnings estimates for Hamilton Lane have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 8% over the past month.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>Hamilton Lane has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p>This combination positions Hamilton Lane well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328471/hamilton-lane-hlne-is-an-incredible-growth-stock-3-reasons-why?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_11_growth-2328471">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.</p><p>While the historical EPS growth rate for General Motors is 19.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth.

This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.</p><p>Right now, General Motors has an S/TA ratio of 0.64, which means that the company gets $0.64 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.44, it can be said that the company is more efficient.</p><p>In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And General Motors is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 4.2% this year versus the industry average of 0%.</p><p><h2>Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions</h2></p><p>Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions.

<![CDATA[ <p>Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns.

<![CDATA[ Accuray Stock Rises After Helix System Wins CE Mark for Cancer Care ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Accuray Incorporated </strong>ARAY has announced that its innovative CT-guided helical radiotherapy system, Accuray Helix, has received the CE Mark, signaling its readiness for deployment in global markets. Designed to meet the needs of emerging regions where access to advanced cancer care is limited, the Accuray Helix system offers a cost-effective solution for delivering high-performance, precise radiation treatments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Radiotherapy is an essential part of cancer treatment, effective for both localized and advanced stages of the disease. ARAY&rsquo;s new technology is particularly significant for non-urban communities where the availability of radiation therapy systems is far below the World Health Organization&rsquo;s recommended guidelines. Accuray Helix is poised to transform cancer care delivery in these underserved areas by enabling clinics to provide state-of-the-art treatments efficiently, even with limited resources.</p><h2>Significance of Accuray&rsquo;s Helix System</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">With its focus on affordability, automation and high throughput, which enhances the speed of planning and delivery of radiation, Accuray&#39;s new system addresses the pressing need for efficient and effective cancer treatments. Its ability to deliver precise, targeted radiation therapy for a wide range of cancers, including breast, cervix, head and neck, gastrointestinal, lung, and prostate, makes it a versatile tool for clinical teams. By enhancing productivity and enabling the treatment of more patients each day, Accuray&rsquo;s Helix is set to play a pivotal role in closing the global cancer care gap, offering hope and improved outcomes for patients in non-urban communities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is estimated that 50% of cancer patients could benefit from radiation therapy, either as a standalone treatment or in combination with surgery, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Accuray&#39;s latest radiotherapy system is specifically designed for regions like India, where access to cancer care is limited. Prioritizing versatility and ease of use, this system marks a key step in the company&#39;s strategy to expand its portfolio of helical radiation therapy solutions.</p><h2>Industry Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per a report in Precedence Research, the global radiation therapy market size was worth $7.47 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to reach $16.3 billion by 2033, witnessing a CAGR of 8.58%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The robust growth will be mainly driven by the increasing incidence of cancer, which is linked to lifestyle changes such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and obesity. This rise in cancer cases has heightened the demand for radiation therapy, leading to market expansion. Additionally, advancements in radiation therapy technology, such as improved ionizing radiation and enhanced treatment efficiency, have increased their effectiveness in killing cancerous cells and preventing the spread of malignancies. Moreover, growing awareness about the benefits of these advanced therapies, along with the integration of innovative software systems that improve connectivity and treatment outcomes, will further accelerate market growth during the forecast period.</p><h2>ARAY Stock Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of ARAY were up almost 1% in pre-market trading following the news. The company&#39;s shares have, however, plunged 17.3% so far this year against the industry&rsquo;s 8.5% rise. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed a 17.8% rise in the same time frame.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8a/75697.jpg?v=1624534832" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, Accuray carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are&nbsp;<strong>Universal Health Services</strong>&nbsp;UHS,&nbsp;<strong>Quest Diagnostics&nbsp;</strong>DGX, and&nbsp;<strong>ABM Industries</strong>&nbsp;ABM.

<![CDATA[ Datadog Rides the Cloud Wave: Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold the Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:43:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Datadog</strong>&#39;s DDOG continued ability to capture market share in the growing observability and application performance monitoring sectors has prompted investors to reassess the company&#39;s potential as a long-term investment even though the stock has underperformed its sector in the past year. The stock has returned 23.7% in the past year compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector&rsquo;s growth of 32.5%. The platform&#39;s ability to provide unified insights across cloud environments gives it an edge over competitors.<br /><br />The company&#39;s commitment to innovation has been a driving force behind its success. By consistently expanding its portfolio with cutting-edge features such as serverless monitoring, real user monitoring and security monitoring, Datadog has demonstrated its ability to stay ahead of evolving customer needs. This focus on product development has not only helped the company maintain its competitive edge but has also contributed to its growing market recognition.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">1-Year Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/40/75688.jpg?v=650046243" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Datadog Strategic Growth in the Cloud Ecosystem</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Datadog has established itself as a frontrunner in the cloud infrastructure market, capitalizing on the ongoing digital transformation trend. The company&#39;s cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform addresses the increasing demand for advanced observability, cloud security and service management solutions, positioning Datadog at the forefront of the rapidly evolving cloud landscape.<br /><br />A key indicator of Datadog&#39;s success is its ability to attract and retain high-value clients. As of the second quarter of 2024, the company had 3,390 customers with an annual run rate (ARR) of $100,000 or more, marking a 13% year-over-year increase. These premium customers contributed significantly to Datadog&#39;s revenues, accounting for approximately 87% of the total ARR.<br /><br />Datadog&#39;s multi-product strategy has shown strong traction, with 83% of customers using two or more products as of June 30, 2024, up from 82% in the year-ago quarter. More impressively, 49% of customers now utilize four or more products, compared to 45% in the year-ago quarter, highlighting successful cross-selling and upselling efforts.<br /><br />Strategic partnerships with major cloud providers, including <strong>Amazon</strong> AMZN-owned Amazon Web Services (AWS), <strong>Alphabet</strong> GOOGL-owned Google Cloud, and <strong>Microsoft </strong>MSFT Azure, have further solidified Datadog&#39;s position in the multi-cloud landscape. As an AWS Partner Network Advanced Technology Partner, Datadog offers seamless integration with AWS infrastructure. Similar deep integrations exist with Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, enhancing observability and security capabilities across these platforms.<br /><br />Datadog&#39;s multi-cloud, multi-vendor approach allows customers to monitor their entire cloud infrastructure from a single platform, regardless of their chosen cloud providers. This unified view enables organizations to optimize performance, troubleshoot issues and maintain robust security across diverse cloud environments, making Datadog an increasingly indispensable tool in the modern IT stack.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Datadog Stock: Justified Premium or Risky Bet?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Datadog operates in the competitive observability and monitoring market, facing established rivals like New Relic, Dynatrace and Splunk. While Datadog has distinguished itself through its unified platform and multi-cloud integrations, competitors offer robust alternatives with established customer bases. The landscape is further complicated by tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon, whose in-house monitoring tools could potentially erode Datadog&#39;s market share.<br /><br />Investor sentiment reflects high growth expectations, with Datadog&#39;s stock trading at a premium compared to the broader Zacks Internet - Software industry. The company&#39;s forward 12-month P/S ratio is approximately 13.1.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">DDOG&rsquo;s P/S F12M Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9e/75690.jpg?v=1955700149" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This valuation, while steep, is supported by Datadog&#39;s strong revenue growth, expanding customer base and increasing product adoption. In the second quarter, the company reported revenue growth of 26.9% year over year, reaching $611.25 million.&nbsp;<br /><br />For 2024, DDOG expects revenues between $2.62 billion and $2.63 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are projected between $1.62 and $1.66 per share.

<![CDATA[ Daktronics Gains 81% YTD: How Should You Play the DAKT Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Daktronics</strong> DAKT shares have jumped 81% year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector&rsquo;s gain of 21.3% and the Zacks Electronics- Miscellaneous Products industry&rsquo;s return of 15.7%.&nbsp;<br /><br />It has outperformed industry peers like <strong>Carrier Global</strong> CARR, <strong>Garmin</strong> GRMN and <strong>SES AI</strong> SES over the same timeframe. CARR and GRMN shares have gained 24.9% and 40.6%, respectively. SES shares have declined 42% YTD.<br /><br />The outperformance in Daktronics shares can be attributed to strong top-line growth in fiscal 2024. DAKT reported net sales of $818.1 million, up 8.5% over fiscal 2023, driven by 8.7% growth in new product and service orders.<br /><br />The designer and manufacturer of electronic scoreboards, programmable display systems and large-screen video displays for sporting, commercial and transportation applications benefited from strong 24% growth in Live Events and more than 20% growth in Transportation orders. International orders increased 7% year over year.<br /><br />DAKT&rsquo;s 2025 prospects are expected to benefit from its initiatives to upgrade internal systems and digital transformation projects. Its focus is on lowering costs through the addition of capacity flexibility, adjustment of production capabilities and improving installation methods.<br /><br />However, DAKT shares meteoric rise brings this question into investors&rsquo; minds - will the initiatives be enough to make the bull run continue?</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">YTD Performance</h2><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/94/75785.jpg?v=1313653166" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>DAKT Stock to Benefit From Strong Order Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Daktronics prospects benefit from strong order growth, particularly in Live Events. A stable macroeconomic environment in North America has driven its order volume growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Strong market adoption of Daktronics&rsquo; digital display technology is a key catalyst. DAKT has been successfully winning clients across larger project-based sports and transportation businesses, driving top-line growth.<br /><br />Daktronics expects Live Events demand to remain strong as venues enhance facilities to entertain fans and attract athletes. Focus on entertainment areas and in places like entryways, atriums, concourses and adjacent entertainment areas offers DAKT an option to expand its footprint through its Narrow Pixel Pitch (NPP) line of products.<br /><br />The launch of the new Flip-Chip COB (Chip on Board) LED display family is the next step in evolving DAKT&rsquo;s NPP product.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s plan to develop the AV integrator network to market its narrow pixel pitch product lines, especially in control room applications used by military, utility, and transportation agencies, is a key catalyst. Daktronics has already installed 131 displays on 43 different bases globally.<br /><br />It is gaining traction in the military end-market through the strong adoption of the Made in America control system and control path, as well as modules and displays.<br /><br />DAKT&rsquo;s investments in improving operating capacity resulted in more efficient fulfillment processes that resulted in the return to market expected lead times. Improved pricing, along with stable input costs, is expected to boost gross margin.</p><h2>Daktronics Shares Undervalued</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />DAKT stock is cheap, as suggested by the Value Score of A.<br /><br />In terms of the trailing 12-month Enterprise Value/Sales (EV/Sales) ratio, Daktronics is trading at 0.86X, lower than the Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector&rsquo;s 7.03X.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">EV/Sales Ratio (TTM)</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/94/75783.jpg?v=38168539" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><br /><h2>Weak Commercial Business a Concern for DAKT Stock</h2><p>Daktronics&rsquo; prospects suffer from sluggishness in the Commercial business. Orders were down 14% in fiscal 2024.<br /><br />Delayed buying by customers has been a key concern due to softness in large projects and slowness in the High School Park and Recreation and Transportation businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>DAKT&rsquo;s Earnings Estimates Steady</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is currently pegged at $839.52 million, suggesting 2.62% growth over fiscal 2024.<br /><br />The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings is currently pegged at $1.13 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days but indicating an 11.72% decline over fiscal 2024.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Daktronics, Inc. Price and Consensus <img alt="Daktronics, Inc. Price and Consensus" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/a8/1724856463.png" title="" width="574" /> </h2><p>Daktronics, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Daktronics, Inc. Quote</p></div><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>What Investors Should Do With DAKT Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Daktronics&rsquo; initiatives to improve operating efficiency and lower costs, as well as strong demand for NPP product bodes well for long-term investors. Hence, it would be better for investors who already own the stock to remain invested.<br />&nbsp;<br />However, weakness in the commercial business is a near-term headwind.&nbsp;<br /><br />Daktronics currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

Hematite average prices rose 9% year over year to $103.01 per dry metric ton (dmt).</p><h2>Fortescue&rsquo;s EBITDA Increases 7%</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Hematite C1 costs (unit operating costs of mining, processing, rail and port, including allocation of direct administration charges and production overheads) were $18.24 per wet metric ton (wmt), 4% higher than fiscal 2023. Higher labor rates and mine plan-driven cost escalation led to higher costs. Fortescue&rsquo;s continued focus on cost control offset some of the impact.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Fortescue&rsquo;s underlying EBITDA was $10.71 billion, up 7% from $9.96 billion in the last fiscal year as higher revenues offset the increase in costs. The underlying EBITDA margin was 59%, in line with fiscal 2023.</p><h2>FSUGY&rsquo;s Cash Position in FY24</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Net cash flow from operating activities was $7.9 billion compared with $7.4 billion in fiscal 2023. Free cash flow increased 16% year over year to $5.1 billion, the second highest in the company&rsquo;s history. Fortescue ended fiscal 2024 with cash on hand of $4.9 billion and net debt of $0.5 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Fortescue declared a final dividend of AUD$0.89 per share (60 cents). Including its interim dividend, the total dividend declared for fiscal 2024 is AUD$1.97 ($134), translating to a 70% payout of FSUGY&rsquo;s net profit after tax. This is consistent with its target of maintaining a payout in the range of 50- 80% of net profit after tax.</p><h2>Fortescue&rsquo;s Guidance for FY25</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Fortescue projects iron ore shipments to be in the range of 190-200 mt on a 100% basis. C1 cost for hematite is projected to be between $18.50 and $19.75 per wmt.</p><h2>Fortescue&rsquo;s Peer Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BHP Group</strong> BHP reported a 2% year-over-year increase in underlying attributable profit from continuing operations at $13.7 billion for fiscal 2024 (ended June 30, 2024). BHP&rsquo;s underlying earnings per share were $2.70 compared with $2.65 in fiscal 2023. Earnings per American Depositary Share were $5.39, higher than $5.30 in the previous fiscal year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The growth was driven by higher prices and sales volumes in BHP&rsquo;s iron ore and copper operations, productivity initiatives, cost discipline and favorable raw material costs. This offset the impact of lower energy coal and nickel prices and higher labor costs on profits. Revenues for fiscal 2024 totaled $55.7 billion, 3.4% higher than the prior fiscal year.</p><h2>Price Performance of FSUGY Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past year, shares of Fortescue have fallen 5.9% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 4.5% decline.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b6/75797.jpg?v=309777905" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>FSUGY&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Fortescue currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks from the basic materials space are <strong>Carpenter Technology Corporation</strong> CRS and <strong>IAMGOLD Corporation</strong> IAG.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nu Holdings Ltd. </strong>NU has delivered an impressive performance this year, with its stock surging 76.4%, significantly outperforming the 20.1% rise of the industry&nbsp;and the 17.8% increase of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NU&rsquo;s success can be attributed to its strong business model, which features a well-established brand, an efficient cost structure and effective monetization strategies.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Year-to-Date Price Performance</h2><h2 style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/be/75784.jpg?v=881349735" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></h2><p>As of the latest trading session, the stock closed at $14.70, just shy of its 52-week high of $14.85. It is trading above its 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish sentiment among investors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In comparison, NU&rsquo;s peers have not fared as well. <strong>Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A.</strong> BSBR has fallen 13.3%, while <strong>SoFi Technologies</strong> SOFI has declined 21.8% during the same period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the sustained strength of NU shares, investors may be wondering if there is still an opportunity to invest in the stock. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p><h2>NU has a Dominant Presence in Latin America</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">NU has established itself as a formidable and innovative force in Brazil&#39;s traditionally slow-moving banking sector. The company has set itself apart from the entrenched oligopoly of traditional banks by implementing a unique cost structure. Unlike legacy banks that have dominated the market for years, NU employs a digital-first strategy. This approach significantly reduces customer service costs, allowing NU to offer lower prices and fees compared to its competitors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The combination of reduced fees and an exceptional digital user experience has led to high customer satisfaction, enhancing NU&rsquo;s brand reputation among Brazilian consumers. This strong brand image has, in turn, driven word-of-mouth referrals, which have become a major driver of customer acquisition for NU. As a result, the majority of Brazilian adults with bank accounts now consider NU their primary banking institution.</p><h2>NU&rsquo;s Expansion Efforts On</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">NU&rsquo;s business model, defined by a strong brand, efficient cost structure, and evolving monetization strategies, has proven highly effective. The company is now working to replicate this success in other Latin American markets, including Mexico and Colombia.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s financial results for the second quarter of 2024 underscore its growth trajectory, with revenues up 65% year over year and adjusted net income soaring 214% compared to the previous year. During the quarter, NU added 5.7 million customers, bringing its global total to 105 million. The growing trend toward digitization is expected to further drive NU&rsquo;s expansion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite challenges such as foreign exchange risks and intense competition, NU&rsquo;s future growth prospects remain strong. Key growth drivers include geographic expansion into countries like Argentina, Peru, Chile and Uruguay, as well as enhancing services in existing markets like Mexico and Colombia.</p><h2>Strong Returns on Capital</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Return on equity (ROE), a measure of profitability, reflects how effectively a company uses its shareholders&#39; investments to generate earnings. NU&rsquo;s trailing 12-month ROE is 27%, compared to the industry average of 8%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a4/75786.jpg?v=464263388" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>NU has also shown strong returns on invested capital (ROIC), with a trailing 12-month ROIC of 11.1%, well above the industry average of 3.8%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/96/75788.jpg?v=435681796" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>NU&rsquo;s Promising Top and Bottom-Line Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NU&rsquo;s 2024 earnings is pegged at 40 cents, indicating 66.7% growth from the year-ago level. Earnings in 2025 are expected to increase 53.1% from the prior-year actuals. The company&rsquo;s sales are expected to increase 48.9% and 34% year over year, respectively, in 2024 and 2025.</p><h2>High Prospects, But Timing is Key</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">NU&rsquo;s effective business model, strong growth prospects and expanding customer base contribute to its potential for continued success. However, given the substantial increase in the stock&rsquo;s price year to date, there is a possibility that the stock could experience a correction. Timing the market is crucial, and potential investors might benefit from waiting for a potential dip before buying.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NU currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328465/nu-holdings-stock-soars-76-ytd-is-it-time-to-jump-onboard?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2328465">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Flowserve Corporation</strong> FLS stands to benefit from strength across its businesses, focus on operational excellence and solid liquidity position. The company remains focused on investing in growth opportunities and strengthening its long-term market position.<br /><br />FLS, which has a market capitalization of $6.5 billion, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Let&rsquo;s delve into the factors that have been aiding the firm for a while now.<br /><br /><strong>End-Market Strength</strong>: The company is witnessing several positive trends in its key end markets that hold promise for its long-term growth. These trends include strength in the chemical and oil &amp; gas markets, growing investment in digitization and decarbonization projects and enhanced spending in the industrial wastewater market. FLS&rsquo; second-quarter bookings of $1.2 billion (up 12.2% year over year) marked the tenth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion bookings.<br /><br /><strong>Acquisition Benefits</strong>: The company aims to expand its market share, product offerings and customer base through strategic acquisitions. In July 2024, Flowserve acquired the intellectual property and in-process R&amp;D related to cryogenic liquefied natural gas (LNG) submerged pump technology, systems and packaging from NexGen Cryogenic Solutions Inc. The buyout will expand the company&rsquo;s LNG product portfolio and complement its existing pumps, valves and mechanical seals offering.<br /><br />Recently, FLS also signed a definitive deal to acquire MOGAS Industries. The inclusion of MOGAS&rsquo; differentiated valve products and its impressive brand and technical expertise in diverse end markets will enable FLS to expand its customer offerings and boost its position in mining, mineral extraction and process industries.<br /><br /><strong>Shareholder-Friendly Moves</strong>: Management remains focused on rewarding its shareholders handsomely. In the first six months of 2024, the company used $55.3 million for distributing dividends and bought back shares worth $16.2 million. Also, in the first quarter, it hiked its quarterly dividend by approximately 5% to 21 cents per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/be/75702.jpg?v=1295044136" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">YTD Price Performance of FLS Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date, the company&rsquo;s shares have gained 19.2% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 8.7% growth.<br /><br /><strong>Estimate Revisions</strong>: It&rsquo;s worth noting that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FLS&rsquo;s 2024 earnings is pegged at $2.76 per share, indicating an increase of 3.6% from the 60-day-ago figure. The consensus estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $3.16 per share, indicating an increase of 2.3% from the year-ago period.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other top-ranked stocks from the same space are discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Crane Company</strong> CR presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 11.2%.

<![CDATA[ Realty Income Stock Hits 52-Week High: Should You Take the Bait? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:27:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <strong>Realty Income</strong> O hit a 52-week high of $62.27 on Tuesday and finally closed at $62.15, up 21.5% in the past three months. The company also outperformed the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry&rsquo;s growth of 15.9% and the S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s rise of 6.2% over the same time frame.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">3-Month Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f2/75780.jpg?v=707723134" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The recent indications of a rate cut in the September FOMC meeting have played a catalyst for this &ldquo;Monthly Dividend Company&rdquo;. Further, the solid second-quarter earnings and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) growth, along with the REIT&rsquo;s encouraging investment plans, have raised investors&rsquo; optimism for this leader in the net lease sector.</p><p>However, investors may be wondering if they&rsquo;ve missed the investment opportunity or if there&rsquo;s still time to take a position. Let&#39;s explore further to determine whether it&rsquo;s wise to consider taking or increasing positions in O or waiting for a better entry point.</p><h2>What is Driving Realty Income Stock?</h2><p>As the inflation reading has now become favorable, the focus has shifted toward confronting the cooling of the labor market. The recent narratives from the Fed Chair also suggest that a rate cut may eventually occur as early as September. This sounds good for rate-sensitive REITs, including Realty Income, because of REITs&rsquo; debt-dependence nature and for viewing them as bond substitutes due to their consistent and high dividend payouts.<br /><br />Considering Realty Income&rsquo;s growth opportunities through acquisitions, the timing of the Fed&rsquo;s rate cut has gained much importance for its investors. An improving investment environment has made the company ambitious, and O aims to achieve $3 billion in investments in 2024. Its focus on the European markets also augurs well.<br /><br />Another reason for Realty Income grabbing investors&rsquo; attention as we approach the actual rate cut is because it enjoys a trademark of the phrase &ldquo;The Monthly Dividend Company&rdquo; and has increased its dividend 23 times in the past five years. This retail REIT has witnessed compound annual dividend growth of 4.3% since 1994. Furthermore, with bond market yields declining, O&rsquo;s forward dividend yield has become relatively more attractive to income investors.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s core business is performing strongly and generating substantial AFFO, with 6% year-over-year growth achieved in AFFO per share in the second quarter. The solid performance of O in recent quarters and improving investment environment are also motivating the company to adopt a more ambitious investment strategy and deliver highly sustainable dividend payouts. Realty Income also has a solid balance sheet and ample liquidity that arms it well to root for investing more aggressively with improvement in market conditions.</p><h2>Will the Trend Last for O?</h2><p>Realty Income&rsquo;s quest for external growth resulted in the company completing its all-stock merger transaction with Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. in January 2024, which added to its size, scale and diversification. Also, as part of its diversification efforts, in November 2023, Realty Income entered into a JV with <strong>Digital Realty</strong> DLR to facilitate the development of two build-to-suit data centers in Northern Virginia.&nbsp;<br /><br />While this foray into the data center market can be considered a meticulous one, this will require close vigilance. Also, any choppiness in the economy will affect the company&rsquo;s performance and investments in the upcoming quarters.<br /><br />Moreover, if there are hiccups in the inflation metrics and the path of rate cuts does not sync with what is now expected, then rate-sensitive stocks like REITs, including Realty Income, will bear the brunt. This will affect O&rsquo;s dividend yield attractiveness.<br /><br />The recent estimate revision trends do not provide a clear direction either. The full-year 2024 consensus mark for AFFO per share has been revised upward over the past week, while for 2025, the same has been adjusted below the prior projections.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ed/75782.jpg?v=2012224127" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>From a valuation perspective, we note that with the recent rally, O is trading at a forward 12-month price-to-FFO, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing retail REITs, of 15.03X. It is at a discount to the industry average of 16.23X but ahead of its 1-year median of 12.77X and close to its high of 15.36X. This implies that the market has recognized or priced the company&rsquo;s growth prospects or earnings potential.<br /><br />The stock is also trading at a premium to its industry peer <strong>NNN REIT, Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s NNN current forward 12-month P/FFO of 13.69X.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Forward 12 Month Price-to-FFO (P/FFO) Ratio</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/12/75781.jpg?v=422674736" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>A detailed analysis indicates that since Realty Income is sensitive to interest rate changes, the latest expectations for rate cuts are generating enthusiasm among investors for this stock. However, any slowdown in the macroeconomic environment is likely to affect the company&rsquo;s performance and investment plans. Also, if the rate cut trajectory deviates much from what is expected, then this stock, along with the REIT industry, is likely to bear the brunt.<br /><br />Similar sentiments of analysts are also echoed in the estimate revision trends, and with the recent rally, the valuation is not as cheap as it was earlier.<br /><br />As a result, existing shareholders may consider holding on to their shares in anticipation of Realty Income executing its growth strategy. However, prospective investors should consider waiting for a more favorable entry point before investing.<br /><br />O stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><br />Note: <em>Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) &mdash; a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328464/realty-income-stock-hits-52-week-high-should-you-take-the-bait?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|investment_ideas-2328464">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Air Industries Secures $110M Contract for GTF Engine Parts ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:21:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Air Industries Group</strong> AIRI recently secured its largest contract, a $110 million deal to manufacture Thrust Struts for Geared Turbo-Fan (GTF) jet engines. This contract will begin in January 2025 and run through 2031.<br /><br />Successful delivery of the thrust struts is likely to bolster AIRI&rsquo;s top-line performance. Following this contract win, the company&rsquo;s backlog count has increased to more than $280 million.</p><h2>AIRI &amp; Combat Jets</h2><p>Air Industries plays an important role in the military jet market as a leading manufacturer of precision components and assemblies, such as landing gears, flight controls, engine mounts, and components for aircraft jet engines. These components are crucial for the safety and reliability of military jets.<br /><br />Notably, the company builds thrust struts for GTF jet engines, made by prominent aircraft engine manufacturer &ndash; Pratt &amp; Whitney. The GTF family of jet engines powers some of the most renowned aircraft across the globe, such as Airbus A320neo, A220 and E2 jets of Embraer. The demand for AIRI&rsquo;s thrust struts, thus, remains solid. The company, therefore, enjoys steady orders for its thrust struts, like the latest one, which in turn are expected to boost its future operating results.</p><h2>AIRI&rsquo;s Growth Prospects</h2><p>Military jets are increasingly sought after due to their advanced technological features, including improved stealth capabilities, precision targeting, and enhanced speed. In recent times, solid demand for military jets has been witnessed worldwide, driven by increasing geopolitical tensions and the need for nations to enhance their defense capabilities. As global conflicts and the threat of warfare are on the rise, countries are investing heavily in modernizing their air forces to maintain strategic advantages.<br /><br />This must have led the Morder Intelligence firm to predict that the global fighter aircraft market will witness a CAGR of 37% during the 2024-2029 time period.<br /><br />This trend has benefitted Air Industries, with the company&rsquo;s products currently being deployed on many high-profile military aircraft such as the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II (Joint Strike Fighter) and F-16 Fighting Falcon, Northrop Grumman E-2C/D, Boeing F-15 Eagle and F-18 Hornet.</p><h2>AIRI&rsquo;s Peer Prospects</h2><p>Other aerospace companies in the sector that are likely to enjoy the perks of the expanding fighter jet market have been discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>The Boeing Company</strong>&rsquo;s BA Defense, Space &amp; Security division is a renowned manufacturer of fixed-wing and rotary-wing combat aircraft. The company&rsquo;s product portfolio includes military jets like the F/A&ndash;18 Super Hornet, F-15 EX and EA-18G Growler.<br /><br />Boeing has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 21.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA&rsquo;s third-quarter 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 10.8% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s figure.<br /><br /><strong>Lockheed Martin Corporation</strong> LMT is the producer of some of the most advanced military jets in the world. Its key jet programs include the F-35 Lightning II, F-22 Raptor, F-16 Fighting Falcon and C-130 Hercules.<br /><br />Lockheed has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 5.3%.<br /><br /><strong>Northrop Grumman Corporation</strong> NOC is a leading provider of proven manned and unmanned air systems. It builds some of the world&rsquo;s most advanced aircraft like the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, A-10 Thunderbolt II, B-21 Raider and F-35 Lightning II.<br /><br />Northrop Gruman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The consensus estimate for 2024 sales indicates year-over-year growth of 5.4%.</p><h2>AIRI Stock Price Movement</h2><p>Shares of AIRI have gained 56.8% in the past month compared with the industry&rsquo;s 2.2% growth.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/5e/75738.jpg?v=65809578" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>AIRI&rsquo;s Zacks Rank</h2><p>AIRI currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Semtech Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s SMTC second-quarter fiscal 2025 non-GAAP earnings of 11 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10%. The bottom line declined 15.4% year over year.&nbsp;<br /><br />Net sales of $215.4 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $212.42 million. The figure declined 9.6% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s levels.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, SMTC provided positive guidance for third-quarter fiscal 2025. At the mid-point, it now expects growth in net sales, gross, operating and adjusted EBITDA margins. This calls for earnings growth in the current quarter.<br /><br />SMTC&rsquo;s shares are up 74.2% year to date compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 11.4%. Despite the decline in top- and bottom-line figures, we expect positive guidance to keep the momentum running.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Semtech Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Semtech Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="286" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/65/1724859305.png" title="" width="621" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Semtech Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Semtech Corporation Quote</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>SMTC&rsquo;s Q2 Top-Line Details</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Broad-based weakness in the industrial end-market led to a top-line decline on a year-over-year basis.

This was driven by solid demand for Semtech&rsquo;s FiberEdge TIAs, laser drivers and Tri-Edge 50G PAM4 products that led to strong growth in hyperscale data center sales in the reported quarter.<br /><br />Sales from the industrial market were $125.3 million (58% of net sales), down 23% from the prior-year period&rsquo;s tally.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sales from the high-end consumer market were $37.1 million (17% of net sales), increasing 9% year over year.

<![CDATA[ Granite Wins $45M Contract From Caltrans, GVA Stock Jumps ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:17:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Banking on its contract-winning spree, <strong>Granite Construction Incorporated</strong>&rsquo;s GVA stock witnessed a jump of 1.5% in the after-hour trading session on Tuesday. Investors might have sensed a strong prospect for the company&rsquo;s top line in the future as it unveiled a $45 million deal from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).<br /><br />GVA&rsquo;s experts will reconstruct and modernize the John Wilkie Safety Roadside Rest Area along the Interstate 40 (I-40) corridor to improve safety and infrastructure. A modern rest area for motorists along I-40 will provide a safe place for travelers to rest and recover, given the significant distance from the nearest town.<br /><br />Granite will provide materials from its Desert Cities Asphalt, including 12,200 tons of asphalt for parking lots and ramps to ensure superior quality and durability of the buildup. The project is expected to begin in September, with nearing completion in January 2026. The value of this contract was included in Granite&rsquo;s second-quarter Committed and Awarded Projects (CAP).</p><h3>Granite Boosts Top Line on Solid CAP</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">GVA is focused on growing a high-quality CAP portfolio within the Construction segment on the back of a positive public funding environment and resilient private market.<br /><br />Granite&rsquo;s CAP consists of two components, namely unearned revenue and other awards. Unearned revenue includes revenues GVA expects to record in the future on executed contracts. Other awards include the general construction portion of construction management/general contractor contracts, as well as deals with unexercised contract options or unissued task orders.<br /><br />On Aug. 22, the company announced that it secured a $38-million contract from Caltrans for the Highway 101 mainline segment, which was included in GVA&rsquo;s second-quarter CAP.</p><h3>A Glimpse of the Stock&#39;s Q2 Performance &amp; Outlook</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">During second-quarter 2024, Granite reported revenue growth of 20%, backed by strong performances from both construction and materials segments. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) also moved up to $1.73 from $1.06 reported in second-quarter 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin stood at 12%, up 290 basis points year over year.<br /><br />Total CAP was $5.58 billion in the second quarter of 2024, up 2.5% year over year and 1.4% sequentially. The uptrend was driven by solid public and private work environments across its geographies. Specifically, CAP in California was $2.3 billion, up $2 million year over year.<br /><br />Significant contributions to CAP during the second quarter of 2024 were $183 million for four highway projects in California, $114 million for a bridge project in Michigan, an $89 million airport project in Texas, a $65 million highway project in Utah and a $48 million fish passage project in Washington.<br /><br />Given various market opportunities and healthy state funding levels, GVA is seeking significant bid opportunities to boost its CAP value in the rest of 2024.<br /><br />For 2024, GVA expects revenues within $3.9-$4 billion, SG&amp;A, as a percentage of revenues, in the 7.5-8% range and adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.5-11.5%. In 2023, Granite reported revenues of $3.5 billion, SG&amp;A of 8.4% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 8%.</p><h3>What&#39;s Boosting GVA&#39;s Shares?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of GVA soared 22.1% in the past three months against the Zacks Building Products - Heavy Construction industry&rsquo;s 1% decline.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/67/75789.jpg?v=1182893377" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">GVA has been consistently receiving contracts on the back of its solid execution efforts.

(D&amp;B), a leading regional aggregates, asphalt, and highway construction company serving Central and Southern Mississippi. This bolt-on buyout is highly complementary to GVA&rsquo;s prior acquisition of Lehman-Roberts Company and Memphis Stone &amp; Gravel (LRC and MSG). (Read more: Granite Acquires D&amp;B, Expands Footprint in Southeast.)<br /><br />As the construction industry continues to evolve, Granite&#39;s strategic expansion positions it as a formidable player in the market.

The company&rsquo;s EPS topped analysts&rsquo; expectations in three of the past four quarters, with an average of 26.4%.</p><h3>Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key Picks</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Granite currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

<![CDATA[ Stryker Rallies 19.8% Year to Date: What's Driving the Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:14:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stryker Corporation </strong>SYK witnessed substantial gains in the year-to-date period. Shares of the company have rallied 19.8% compared with 10.8% growth of the&nbsp;industry. The S&amp;P 500 Composite has risen 17.9% during the same time frame.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With healthy fundamentals and strong growth opportunities, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company appears to be a solid wealth creator for its investors at the moment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Headquartered in Kalamazoo, MI, Stryker is one of the world&rsquo;s largest medical device companies operating in the global orthopedic market. The company has three business segments &mdash; Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology &amp; Spine.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strength in Stryker&rsquo;s flagship Mako Total Knee Platform, which enables surgeons to do pre-operative planning and precise surgeries, looks promising. The company is also adopting several cost-cutting measures, including restructuring plans. The company&rsquo;s prospects in 2024 seem promising on the back of strong customer demand for its existing products, as well as new launches. Stryker&rsquo;s recent strategic acquisitions also raise optimism about the stock.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/df/75751.jpg?v=1693677285" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Catalysts Driving Stryker&rsquo;s Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The rally in the company&rsquo;s share price can be attributed to its robust robotic arm-assisted surgery platform, Mako, a solid product portfolio, along with some tactical acquisitions. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter fiscal 2024 performance and robust business potential are expected to contribute further.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Stryker exited the second quarter of fiscal 2024 on a strong note, wherein both earnings and revenues improved year over year. The company witnessed a strong performance in the U.S. market, notably in Instruments, Medical, Endoscopy, Trauma and Extremities, and Mako, which is likely to have aided in the stock&rsquo;s price growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SYK has raised its revenue and earnings projections for fiscal 2024, which are also likely to have interested investors. For fiscal 2024, the company now expects organic growth for total revenues in the range of 9-10% compared with the earlier guidance of 8.5-9.5%. For 2024, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are now anticipated to be in the band of $11.90-$12.10, implying growth of 12% at the midpoint of the guided range. The company previously expected EPS in the range of $11.85-$12.05.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SYK also has a wide range of products to offer, for which the investors seem optimistic. Due to its broad spectrum of products, it is shielded from any notable decline in sales during challenging economic times. The company&#39;s extensive experience in medical robots, artificial intelligence, and mechatronics has allowed it to stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In August, SYK announced the launch of its Pangea Plating System, which received FDA clearance in late 2023. Pangea System is likely to provide variable-angle plating for a range of patient demographics, and its portfolio is both extensive and adaptable. With Pangea System on board, Stryker is now the go-to partner for all things trauma-related, including plates, nails, external fixation devices, and more, supported by the company&rsquo;s committed staff and first-rate service.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In June, Stryker announced the launch of its latest device in the market, offering advanced technology, the LIFEPAK 35 monitor/defibrillator. The device is likely to enable more efficient workflow and provide advanced clinical solutions to emergency responders and healthcare professionals. The company also launched the Gamma4 Hip Fracture Nailing System in Germany on June 4.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to expanding organically, Stryker has bolstered its expansion by way of acquisitions. In August, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Vertos Medical Inc., a privately held company providing a minimally invasive solution for treating chronic lower back pain caused by lumbar spinal stenosis.As a result of the acquisition, Stryker is set to expand its minimally invasive pain management portfolio with differentiated treatments and expand its reach across ambulatory surgery centers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the same month, Stryker entered into a definitive agreement to acquire care.ai, a privately held company specializing in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted virtual care workflows, smart room technology and ambient intelligence solutions. SYK also announced the completion of the acquisition of MOLLI Surgical Inc., a privately held company specializing in the development of wire-free soft tissue localization technology for breast-conserving surgery, in August.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In July, Stryker completed the previously announced acquisition of Artelon, a privately held company specializing in innovative soft tissue fixation products for foot and ankle and sports medicine procedures.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Stryker&rsquo;s Risk Factors</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As Stryker continues to acquire a large number of companies, while this improves revenue opportunities, it is also likely to add to integration risks, putting gross and operating margins under pressure. Frequent acquisitions may impact the company&rsquo;s balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill and intangible assets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A negative change in exchange rates is also a threat to SYK&#39;s core operations. The trend is likely to continue for the rest of 2024, though, at a slower pace. The company is also facing inflationary pressure, leading to lower margins.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>A Look at Estimates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">SYK&rsquo;s EPS for fiscal 2024 and 2025 is projected to increase 13.2% and 12.1% to $12.00 and $13.45 on a year-over-year basis, respectively.&nbsp; The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS for fiscal 2024 and 2025 has moved north by 5 cents and 7 cents, respectively, for the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues for fiscal 2024 and 2025 are anticipated to rise 9.2% and 7.8%, respectively, to $22.37 billion and $24.12 billion on a year-over-year basis.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are&nbsp;<strong>Universal Health Service</strong>&nbsp;UHS,&nbsp;<strong>Quest Diagnostics&nbsp;</strong>DGX and&nbsp;<strong>ABM Industries</strong>&nbsp;ABM. While Universal Health Service sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Quest Diagnostics and ABM Industries carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). <strong>You can see&nbsp;</strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Universal Health Service has an estimated long-term growth rate of 19%. UHS&rsquo; earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 14.58%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Universal Health Service has gained 41.1% compared with the&nbsp;industry&#39;s&nbsp;34.8% rise so far this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quest Diagnostics has an estimated long-term growth rate of 6.20%. DGX&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 3.31%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quest Diagnostics shares have gained 3.7% so far this year compared with the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s&nbsp;10.2% rise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ABM Industries&rsquo; earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 7.34%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ABM&#39;s shares have risen 24.1% so far this year compared with the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s&nbsp;11.9% growth.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328454/stryker-rallies-19-8-year-to-date-what-s-driving-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|price_surge_/_plunge-2328454">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ AtriCure's Shares Likely to Benefit From New AtriClip Device Sales ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:13:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AtriCure, Inc.&nbsp;</strong>ATRC recently announced the treatment of the first patient with the AtriClip FLEX-Mini device. The device recently received the FDA 510(k) clearance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The AtriClip FLEX-Mini, the smallest surgical left atrial appendage (LAA) device available, raises the standard with its easy-to-use, simple design that provides physicians with better visibility and access. It builds on the well-proven technology of AtriCure&#39;s AtriClip platform.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The recent developments regarding AtriCure&rsquo;s ArtiClip devices are likely to help the business generate additional revenues and improve the stock&rsquo;s price.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">More on the AtriCure&rsquo;s AtriClip FLEX-Mini Device</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The AtriClip FLEX-Mini&rsquo;s fully enclosed design with parallel beams for continuous closure force ensures appropriate pressure on atrial tissue. It combines the reliable components of the AtriClip portfolio.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">During surgeries, the low-profile design gives doctors exceptional control since it improves visibility without sacrificing stability. This makes the application process much simpler. Moreover, the ergonomic handle shape of the gadget allows for single-handed placement.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Recent Developments Regarding AtriCure&rsquo;s AtriClip Devices</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In August, ATRC announced the receipt of an expanded indication for the AtriClip&nbsp;in CE-marked countries in&nbsp;Europe. The product is now indicated for use in patients at high risk of thromboembolism for whom LAA exclusion is warranted.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expanded indication for AtriClip is based on ArtiCure&rsquo;s clinical findings that patients who are at high risk of thromboembolism can experience fewer strokes with the device. The company expects significant growth potential from the use of mechanical appendage closure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In July, ArtiCure announced that it had received regulatory approval from the&nbsp;National Medical Products Administration of&nbsp;China&nbsp;to market and sell several models of its AtriClip&nbsp;LAA Exclusion System.The company is likely to work closely with Chinese regulatory authorities to facilitate the introduction of additional innovative products in the future. This approval is expected to expand ArtiCure&rsquo;s business globally and generate additional revenues.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Prospects Favoring AtriCure</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per a report by Grand View Research, the global atrial fibrillation market size&nbsp;was estimated to be $22.4 billion in 2022&nbsp;and is expected to witness a growth rate of 10.1% from 2023 to 2030.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The increasing prevalence of AFib and growing awareness about the condition are expected to drive the market. Factors such as the aging population, lifestyle changes, and the surge in chronic illnesses such as obesity and diabetes are contributing to the rising incidence of atrial fibrillation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The recent developments regarding AtriCure&rsquo;s ArtiClip devices are likely to help the business generate additional revenues and increase the price of shares.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past six months, ATRC&rsquo;s shares have plunged 28.3% against the industry&rsquo;s rise of 11.5%. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 17.9% in the same time frame.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6c/75753.jpg?v=895469370" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ATRC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are&nbsp;<strong>Universal Health Service</strong>&nbsp;UHS,&nbsp;<strong>Quest Diagnostics&nbsp;</strong>DGX and&nbsp;<strong>ABM Industries</strong>&nbsp;ABM.

<![CDATA[ Why Casey's (CASY) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:10:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Casey's General Stores (CASY), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Convenience Stores industry, could be a great candidate to consider.</p><p>This convenience store chain has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 21.78%.</p><p>For the last reported quarter, Casey's came out with earnings of $2.34 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.70 per share, representing a surprise of 37.65%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.20 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.33 per share, delivering a surprise of 5.91%.</p><p>With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Casey's. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.</p><p>Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.</p><p>The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.</p><p>Casey's currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.21%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on September 4, 2024.</p><p>When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.</p><p>Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.</p><p>Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328452/why-casey-s-casy-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_7-2328452">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Pfizer Follows Lilly's Example, Unveils DTC Service for Selling Drugs ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:08:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pfizer </strong>PFE is launching a new direct-to-consumer (DTC) website called PfizerForAll, which will allow patients to order its marketed products for COVID-19, influenza and migraine directly.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">How the New PFE Platform Works</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The digital pharmacy will offer a convenient home delivery option for Pfizer medicines through third-party pharmacies. The new website also provides access to scheduling same-day appointments with independent healthcare professionals, either in-person or online.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PFE is also offering adult users to check whether they&rsquo;re eligible for certain vaccines and, if so, make an appointment at a nearby pharmacy to get selected shots. The DTC platform will put all of the company&rsquo;s savings and support programs in one place, potentially helping patients find options for which they&rsquo;re eligible.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The digital platform is not just limited to Pfizer&rsquo;s products &mdash; users can use the site to schedule a COVID-19 vaccination with Moderna&rsquo;s vaccine just as easily as Pfizer&rsquo;s.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The DTC platform will operate within the US healthcare system, allowing patients to use their existing insurance and pharmacy benefits. The services offered through PfizerForAll are being provided in partnership with healthcare organizations, which include UpScriptHealth, Alto Pharmacy and Instacart.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PFE Stock Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date, Pfizer&rsquo;s shares have inched up 0.1% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 27% rise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b4/75777.jpg?v=1318059913" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Drugmakers with DTC Platforms</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Pfizer is not the only one with its own DTC platform. At the start of this year, <strong>Eli Lilly </strong>LLY launched the digital pharmacy LillyDirect to help patients order medicines for obesity, migraine and diabetes directly. Unlike PfizerForAll, LillyDirect is currently limited to providing access only to LLY&rsquo;s marketed drugs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On Tuesday, Lilly announced that it is launching single-dose vials of obesity drug Zepbound, which are priced at least 50% lower than the list price of&nbsp;all similar medications for obesity. This move is aimed at easing the manufacture of Zepbound, which is currently facing supply shortages in response to higher demand.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Our Take</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">These online platforms by Lilly and Pfizer should boost their respective top line. The use of online platforms would help drugmakers communicate with their consumers directly and understand their needs better. Direct access to patients could also help circumvent players like pharmacy benefit managers that drugmakers say reduce their revenue and hurt patient access.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Pfizer Inc.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EMCOR Group, Inc.</strong> EME has seen its shares rise steadily, rallying 76.8% year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Heavy Construction industry&rsquo;s 59.4% growth. The broader Construction sector rose 18.5% and the S&amp;P 500 grew 17.8% in the same time frame.<br /><br />This Norwalk, CT-based electrical and mechanical construction and facilities services provider has been showing strengths across its business, given solid demand in key market sectors such as high-tech manufacturing, network and communications (including data centers), and healthcare.<br /><br />EME stock also outpaced its competitors like <strong>Dycom Industries, Inc.</strong> DY, <strong>MasTec, Inc.</strong> MTZ and <strong>AECOM </strong>ACM, which surged 50%, 45.6% and 10%, respectively, in the YTD period.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">EMCOR&rsquo;s YTD Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f2/75763.jpg?v=1324634099" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">EME Stock Trades Above 50 and 200-Day Moving Averages</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Technical indicators suggest continued strong performance for EME. Notably, the 50-day SMA continues to read higher than the 200-day SMA, signaling the bullish trend. This technical strength underscores positive market sentiment and confidence in EMCOR&rsquo;s financial health and prospects.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c4/75760.jpg?v=677754305" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Helping EMCOR Stock to Surge</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Diverse Market Exposure:</strong> EMCOR&rsquo;s operations span across various sectors, with a strong presence in high-tech manufacturing, healthcare, network and communications, and industrial services. Also, the company is experiencing high growth in key regions like Texas (mainly in high-tech manufacturing and data centers), the Midwest, and the Mid-Atlantic, further solidifying its market presence.<br /><br />High-tech and traditional manufacturing are expanding due to increasing demand for advanced manufacturing facilities, where EMCOR&#39;s expertise in complex electrical and mechanical construction will drive revenue growth. The rise in data center construction and 5G infrastructure in the network and communications sector offers EMCOR long-term, stable contracts. The company&rsquo;s investments in Virtual Design Construction (&ldquo;VDC&rdquo;) and Building Information Modeling (&ldquo;BIM&rdquo;) also enhance its ability to deliver projects efficiently, improving margins. The healthcare sector is growing, driven by an aging population, and EMCOR&#39;s ability to handle complex systems in healthcare facilities will lead to more project opportunities.<br /><br />The shift toward electrification and the EV value chain, including EV battery manufacturing and charging stations, presents significant opportunities for EMCOR. Additionally, the focus on energy efficiency and sustainability, with investments in renewable energy and energy-efficient systems, aligns with EMCOR&#39;s capabilities, ensuring continued demand for its services. Legislative incentives, such as the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, are also expected to create more opportunities in manufacturing and renewable energy projects.<br /><br />Overall, EMCOR&#39;s focus on these growing sectors is likely to result in sustained revenue growth, improved margins, and strong shareholder returns, positioning the company well for long-term success.<br /><br /><strong>High RPO Levels Indicating Future Growth:</strong> The company reported remaining performance obligations (RPOs), which provide insight into the company&rsquo;s future revenue potential of $9 billion, an 8.6% increase year over year in the second quarter of 2024. This near-record level of RPOs suggests a strong pipeline of future projects, particularly in data centers, high-tech manufacturing, healthcare, and water/wastewater. RPOs in the network and communications sector, which includes data centers, reached a record $1.7 billion, a 40% increase year over year in the quarter. This growth underscores EMCOR&rsquo;s strong position in the ongoing expansion of the data center market.<br /><br /><strong>Strategic Acquisitions to Broaden EME&rsquo;s Footprint:</strong> The acquisitions are part of a broader strategy to expand in high-growth sectors and geographies, adding to EMCOR&#39;s ability to deliver complex projects across various industries.<br /><br />In the first half of 2024, EMCOR acquired four companies. The acquired companies are set to strengthen their Mechanical Construction, Building Services and Industrial Services segments, positioning them well for future growth.<br /><br /><strong>Strong Cash Flow and Balance Sheet: </strong>The company generated $412 million in operating cash flow in the first six months of 2024, almost double the amount from the prior-year period. This strong cash flow supports the company&rsquo;s ability to fund growth initiatives, pursue acquisitions, and return capital to shareholders. EMCOR&#39;s balance sheet remains robust and liquid, providing a solid foundation to support both organic and inorganic growth strategies.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What May Impact EME Stock&rsquo;s Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has been experiencing challenges in the commercial real estate sector due to reduced demand and the completion of various projects. The U.S. and U.K. site-based services businesses face ongoing challenges, especially in the U.S. Building Services segment, where the company has encountered revenue headwinds in the last reported quarter due to the non-renewal of certain contracts.<br /><br />Also, the company remains cautious about macroeconomic challenges such as higher interest rates, supply chain disruptions, energy price fluctuations, global conflicts, and the potential impact of the upcoming U.S. presidential election on decision-making processes.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">EME Stock&rsquo;s Estimate Movement &amp; Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Analysts are showing confidence in the stock, as indicated by recent upward revisions in earnings estimates. Over the last 60 days, forecasts for 2024 and 2025 have increased to $18.00 (from $16.10) and $19.59 (from $17.15), respectively.<br />&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/35/75759.jpg?v=127038156" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">EME stock is trading slightly at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 20X compared with the industry&rsquo;s 19.3X and higher than the median of 19.5X, reflecting a stretched valuation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1d/75762.jpg?v=570216097" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How to Play EMCOR Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the competitive non-residential services sector, EMCOR, a Fortune 500 company with an $18 billion market cap, distinguishes itself. Known for its strategic focus and diverse service offerings, EMCOR has experienced substantial growth recently.<br /><br />The company boasts a robust 32.7% return on equity over the trailing 12 months, surpassing industry averages and demonstrating efficient use of shareholder funds. Coupled with strong cash flow, a solid balance sheet, strategic acquisitions, and strong demand in high-growth sectors, EMCOR is well-positioned for continued expansion. The company&#39;s $9 billion in RPOs underscores a promising future pipeline.<br /><br />Despite a premium valuation, upward revisions in earnings estimates reinforce its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, making EMCOR an attractive addition to investors&#39; portfolios at present.

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co.</strong> ANF has posted strong second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with sales and earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and showing year-over-year improvement. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter in which Abercrombie has outperformed top and bottom-line estimates.<br /><br />The strong performance was fueled by substantial growth across regions and brands, especially in the Americas and the Abercrombie brand. The company&rsquo;s earnings were supported by robust revenue growth, and enhanced gross and operating margins. However, the gross margin missed expectations this quarter.<br /><br />Abercrombie&rsquo;s earnings per share (EPS) of $2.50 in the fiscal second quarter improved 131.5% from the adjusted EPS of $1.08 reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.14. The robust earnings performance can be attributed to strong top-line growth, coupled with improved gross and operating margins.<br /><br />Net sales of $1.13 billion advanced 21% year over year on a reported basis and 22% in constant currency. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09 billion. ANF&rsquo;s comparable sales improved 18%. The top-line beat was driven by broad-based net sales growth across regions, brands and channels, led by the strength of its brand portfolio and improved global capabilities.<br /><br />Abercrombie shares fell 10% in pre-market trading on Aug. 28 despite the company reporting strong second-quarter fiscal 2024 results and raising its fiscal 2024 outlook. The negative response from analysts likely stemmed from the gross margin lagging expectations and the projected impacts of having one less week in fiscal 2024. Despite this, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have soared 88.9% year to date compared with the industry&#39;s 9% growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/54/75776.jpg?v=105833275" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Abercrombie&rsquo;s Regional &amp; Brand Sales Drive Growth</h2><p>Sales in the Americas improved 23% year over year to $901.2 million. Additionally, sales grew 16% to $199.7 million in the EMEA and rose 3% to $33.1 million in the APAC. Comparable sales grew 18%, 17% and 21%, respectively, in the Americas, EMEA and the APAC regions.<br /><br />Net sales improved 26% year over year to $582.4 million for the Abercrombie brand. Moreover, sales increased 17% to $551.6 million at Hollister, reflecting strong sequential gains, and benefits from a better-than-expected summer and back-to-school selling season. The Abercrombie brand contributed 51% to the total company sales, whereas Hollister represented 49% of sales. Comparable sales grew 21% for Abercrombie and 15% for Hollister in the reported quarter.<br /><br />Our model predicted sales growth of 18.7% for the Abercrombie brand and 9% for Hollister for second-quarter fiscal 2024. We estimated sales to increase 17.4% in the Americas and 6.4% in the EMEA, with a decline of 0.1% in the APAC for the fiscal second quarter.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p>&nbsp;</p> <img alt="Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/7e/1724860400.png" title="" width="581" /> <p>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Company Quote</p></div><h2>ANF&rsquo;s Quarterly Performance: Improved Margins &amp; Expenses</h2><p>Abercrombie&rsquo;s gross margin of 64.9% in the fiscal second quarter expanded 240 basis points (bps) from last year&rsquo;s reported gross margin. Moreover, the gross margin expanded 230 bps from last year&rsquo;s adjusted gross margin. The increase was driven by higher average unit retail, and lower freight and raw material expenses. While impressive, gross margin growth lagged our expectations of a 360-bps expansion to 66.1%<br /><br />Operating expenses, excluding other operating income, increased 12.9% year over year to $561 million. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses, excluding other operating income, of 49.5% declined 380 bps from the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />The company reported an operating income of $176 million compared with a reported operating income of $89.8 million and an adjusted operating income of $88.4 million in the year-ago period. It reported an operating margin of 15.5%, up 590 bps from a reported operating margin of 9.6% and 600 bps from the adjusted operating margin of 9.5% in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />We estimated a 20-bps decline in the adjusted operating expense rate to 53% for the fiscal second quarter.</p><h2>ANF&rsquo;s Financial Health Looks Stable</h2><p>Abercrombie ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $738.4 million, no net long-term borrowings, and stockholders&rsquo; equity of $1.2 billion, excluding non-controlling interests.<br /><br />The company had a liquidity of $1.2 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter, which included cash and equivalents, and $430 million of borrowings available under the ABL Facility. Net cash provided by operating activities was $260 million as of Aug. 3, 2024.</p><h2>Abercrombie&rsquo;s 3Q &amp; FY24 Outlook Shows Promise</h2><p>Abercrombie is on track to achieve its 2024 target of demonstrating sustainable, profitable growth. The company expects to continue benefiting from strength in its brands, driven by its focus on delivering high-quality, on-trend assortments for new and retained customers across regions and brands. It has also been focused on making strategic investments across stores, digital and technology, which are slated to strengthen the company in the long term.<br /><br />Backed by the strong first-half fiscal 2024 results, Abercrombie has raised its sales and operating margin views for fiscal 2024. It anticipates net sales for fiscal 2024 to increase 12-13% from the $4.3 billion reported in the prior year. It earlier expected net sales growth of 10% for fiscal 2024.<br /><br />The company&#39;s fiscal 2024 is one week shorter than fiscal 2023. Abercrombie anticipates this lost selling week to reduce fourth-quarter sales by $80 million or 5.5 percentage points. For the fiscal year, the retailer expects a sales impact of $50 million or 1.2 percentage points.<br /><br />Abercrombie expects the Abercrombie brand to continue outperforming the Hollister brand in fiscal 2024, with the Americas region leading the regional performance.<br /><br />The company expects an operating margin of 14-15% for fiscal 2024 compared with the 14% mentioned earlier. The increased operating margin is likely to be driven by higher gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. Abercrombie anticipates an effective tax rate in the mid-to-high 20s for fiscal 2024. Capital expenditure is estimated to be $170 million for fiscal 2024.<br /><br />For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, net sales are projected to rise in the low-double digits from the $1.06 billion reported in the year-ago period. The operating margin is expected to be 13-14%, an increase from the operating margin of 13.1% delivered in third-quarter fiscal 2023. The effective tax rate is likely to be in the mid-20s.</p><h2>Other Solid Picks in ANF&rsquo;s Sector</h2><p>We have highlighted three other top-ranked stocks from the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, namely <strong>Boot Barn</strong> BOOT, <strong>Deckers Outdoor </strong>DECK and <strong>Wingstop </strong>WING.<br /><br />Boot Barn, a lifestyle retail chain devoted to western and work-related footwear, apparel and accessories, currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

<![CDATA[ Is First Busey's Merger Deal With CrossFirst a Strategic Move? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:05:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>First Busey Corporation</strong> BUSE, or &ldquo;Busey,&rdquo; entered into a definitive merger agreement with <strong>CrossFirst Bankshares, Inc. </strong>CFB, or &ldquo;CrossFirst.&rdquo; Per the terms, CrossFirst will merge into Busey. Both companies&rsquo; board of directors unanimously approved the merger deal.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After deal completion, the combined holding company will continue to operate under the name First Busey Corporation, while the combined bank will be known as Busey Bank. CrossFirst Bank is planning to integrate with and join Busey Bank by mid-2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This merger deal represents a great fit from a strategic, financial and cultural standpoint to capitalize on many prospects as a combined company in 2025 and beyond.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Once completed, this merger will allow BUSE to take advantage of CrossFirst&#39;s strong presence in high-growth regions with compelling growth potential. The deal will also assist Busey in catalyzing additional commercial banking growth as well as expanding opportunities to build existing wealth management and payment businesses.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><br />BUSE &amp; CFB Merger Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">CrossFirst will merge with and into Busey in an all-common stock transaction valued at nearly $916.8 million, based on Busey&rsquo;s closing stock price of $27.39 as of Aug. 26, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CrossFirst stockholders will receive 0.6675 shares of Busey common stock for each share they own. CFB&rsquo;s common shareholders, who do not currently receive a dividend, will be eligible to receive Busey&#39;s continued dividends as declared following the merger.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Upon closing of the deal, the fully diluted shares of the combined business, which will continue to list on the Nasdaq under the &quot;BUSE&quot; stock ticker symbol, will be owned by about 36.5% of CFB&rsquo;s shareholders and nearly 63.5% of Busey&#39;s shareholders.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><br />Strategic Benefits of BUSE &amp; CFB Merger Deal</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">By extending its regional operating model into the rapidly-expanding metro areas of Kansas City, Wichita, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver and Phoenix, the merger will strengthen Busey&#39;s relationship with commercial banks and present new avenues. This will propel the expansion of its wealth management division and FirsTech, Inc. &mdash;&nbsp; Busey&rsquo;s subsidiary that provides payment technology solutions.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With combined total assets of about $20 billion, including $17 billion in deposits, $15 billion in loans and $13 billion in wealth assets under care, the combination is anticipated to establish a leading full-service commercial bank that would serve customers from 77 full-service facilities spread across 10 states.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The combination of business models, capital strength and economies of scale is expected to significantly improve Busey&#39;s performance metrics, leading to increased profitability and shareholder returns.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Excluding one-time merger-related charges and presuming fully phased-in cost savings, pro forma projections predict an accretion of almost 20% in Busey profits per share in 2026, the first full year of merged operations.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With 9.6% leverage, 11.0% CET1 and 14.1% total risk-based capital, capital ratios are anticipated to be much above &quot;well-capitalized&quot; requirements. An internal rate of return of more than 19% is anticipated from the transaction.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><br />Final Words</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">First Busey successfully expanded its banking and wealth management services through a series of strategic acquisitions in the past years, tripling its asset size in the process.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BUSE&rsquo;s strategic merger deal with CrossFirst will boost its presence across Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. This deal will also increase its asset size and fortify its commercial banking businesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In April 2024, Busey acquired Merchants &amp; Manufacturers Bank Corporation &mdash;&nbsp; the holding company for Merchants &amp; Manufacturers Bank that expanded BUSE&rsquo;s presence in rapidly-growing markets of Chicago suburbs. The buyout also increased its deposit market share and fortified its commercial banking and wealth management businesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past six months, BUSE shares have increased 20.1% compared with 21% growth of the industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3d/75739.jpg?v=330887929" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, BUSE carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><br />Inorganic Expansion Efforts by Other Finance Stocks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>U.S. Bancorp</strong>&rsquo;s USB &mdash; banking division &mdash; U.S. Bank, entered into a strategic partnership with Edward Jones. The collaboration is intended to offer comprehensive banking and credit card solutions to Edward Jones clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The latest collaboration is in line with the U.S. Bank alliance strategy to broaden the company&#39;s regional reach and better serve its customers. With this, clients will have access to improved financial solutions that cater to their diverse needs. Through alliances, U.S. Bank continued in its goal of reaching customers where they are and providing a streamlined experience concerning its core deposit products.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In June, <strong>Stifel Financial Corp.</strong> SF and Lord Abbett, LLC entered into a joint agreement to establish a leveraged lending joint venture &mdash; SBLA Private Credit. This new entity will concentrate on the origination and management of existing loans to small and mid-sized portfolio companies of financial sponsors, thus augmenting the existing capabilities of both firms.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328495/is-first-busey-s-merger-deal-with-crossfirst-a-strategic-move?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_finance_sector-2328495">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Ericsson to Boost Egypt's Network Infrastructure: Stock to Gain? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:02:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ericsson </strong>ERIC recently announced that it had inked a definitive partnership with e&amp; Egypt aimed at bolstering the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure in the Middle-East country and its surrounding region. This collaborative effort marks a major leap forward in the telecommunication landscape, showcasing e&amp; Egypt&rsquo;s commitment to technological advancement in the region.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ERIC&rsquo;s Focus on Improved Connectivity</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The partnership will see e&amp; Egypt integrate Ericsson&#39;s high-performing 20-port antennas from the cutting-edge Ericsson Antenna System (EAS) into its network. These antennas, designed for multiple frequencies, are crucial for ensuring superior connectivity and developing a robust infrastructure to meet evolving consumer needs. Following the deployment, operators will be able to share sites efficiently, optimize the network for the upcoming 5G rollout in Egypt and pave the way for future telecommunication innovations.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How ERIC Could Have Secured the Deal?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">With the emergence of the smartphone market and subsequent usage of mobile broadband, user demand for coverage speed and quality has increased in recent times. Further, to maintain superior performance as traffic increases, there is also a continuous need for network tuning and optimization. Ericsson is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. It is reportedly the world&rsquo;s largest supplier of LTE technology with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide.<br /><br />Ericsson is focusing on 5G system development and has undertaken many notable endeavors to position itself for market leadership on 5G. The company believes that standardization of 5G is the cornerstone for digitization of industries and broadband. The deployment of 5G networks is likely to boost the adoption of IoT (Internet of Things) devices with technologies like network slicing gaining more prominence. Ericsson continues to invest in the Enterprise business to make it a sizeable part of its business in a few years. The company has introduced on-demand network slicing capability in Android 14 devices. It empowers developers to enhance the flexibility of applications and allows service providers to better align the network connectivity with user-specific requirements.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Will ERIC Stock Benefit From the Collaboration?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Ericsson&#39;s innovative solutions are reshaping connectivity across sectors, from enhancing network visibility through advanced 5G deployments to revolutionizing industries with robust IoT innovations. The company&rsquo;s leadership in cloud and edge computing is providing scalable solutions for efficient digital infrastructures worldwide, ensuring flexibility and resilience in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.<br /><br />By incorporating EAS technology, Ericsson aims to set new standards for connectivity, support societal advancement and drive technological progress in Egypt. These advancements are set to play a crucial role in shaping the future of mobile connectivity and network infrastructure.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ERIC Stock Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Ericsson have gained 45.2% over the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 45.6%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c8/75730.jpg?v=105018265" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Ericsson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).<br /><br />Some better-ranked stocks in the broader industry have been discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Arista Networks, Inc. </strong>ANET, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, supplies products to a prestigious set of customers, including Fortune 500 global companies in markets such as cloud titans, enterprises, financials and specialty cloud service providers.

<![CDATA[ <div><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Elastic N.V. </strong>ESTC is scheduled to release its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug. 29, after market close.</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">ESTC outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 52%, on average.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Elastic N.V. Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p>&nbsp;</p> <img alt="Elastic N.V.

Cost consciousness and operational efficiency are likely to have led customers to choose ESTC as their preferred platform to consolidate workload.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We expect Subscription revenues to have increased in the quarter under review on the back of growing revenues from Elastic Cloud. Growth in Elastic Cloud&rsquo;s revenues is anticipated to have been driven by self-service motion in the small and medium-sized (SMB) business segment. Strong GenAI adoption among the company&rsquo;s largest customers is likely to have a significant positive impact on annual contract values.</p><div><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.4 per share, indicating 18.5% growth on a year-over-year basis. The bottom line is expected to have benefited from strong margins.</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What Our Model Says About ESTC</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for ESTC this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here.

<![CDATA[ Acquisitions Aid Automatic Data Processing Amid Rising Expenses ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:01:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automatic Data Processing, Inc. </strong>ADP has had an impressive run over the year-to-date period. The stock has gained 19.3% compared with the 14.4% rally of the industry it belongs to and the 19% rise of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite in the said period.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">YTD Price Perfomance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6f/75713.jpg?v=178010282" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ADP has reported an impressive fourth-quarter fiscal 2024. Earnings per share of $2.1 beat the consensus estimate by 1% and increased 10.6% from the year-ago quarter. Total revenues of $4.8 billion surpassed the consensus estimate by a slight margin and grew 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How is ADP Doing?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Automatic Data Processing&rsquo;s three-tier business strategy assists it in maintaining its market position and thriving as a human capital management (HCM) technology and service provider. It is focused on delivering a complete suite of cloud-based HCM and human resource outsourcing (HRO) solutions. ADP is expanding its international HCM and HRO businesses with established local, in-country software solutions and cloud-based multi-country solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Celergo, WorkMarket, Global Cash Card and The Marcus Buckingham are a few of the acquired companies that have strengthened ADP&rsquo;s customer base and assisted it in expanding operations in the international markets. Automatic Data Processing continues to acquire companies that strategically fit its overall business mix and are easy to integrate over the long term. The recent acquisition of Honu HR, Inc. DBA Sora improved its strategy to streamline HR processes through automation, combining Sora&#39;s user-friendly platform with ADP&#39;s HCM solutions for enhanced efficiency and employee experiences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Dividend-seeking investors will find these shares appealing. ADP paid out $1.9 billion in dividends in fiscal 2023, $1.7 billion in fiscal 2022 and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2021. Such moves indicate the company&rsquo;s commitment to returning value to shareholders and underline its confidence in business. We anticipate steady income growth, which will lead to constant cash flow generation, enabling it to pay out dividends.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ADP&#39;s current ratio (a measure of liquidity) at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 was pegged at 1.01, higher than 0.99 at the end of the year-ago quarter. A current ratio of more than 1 often indicates that the company is efficient enough to pay off its short-term obligations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, the company has been witnessing a notable rise in its expenditure due to ongoing acquisitions and investments in its transformation projects. In fiscal 2023, ADP incurred $13.8 billion as total expenses, indicating 8% year-over-year growth. In 2022, the company&#39;s total expenses reached $12.8 billion, marking a substantial 10% increase from the previous year. This expense trend has persisted over several years, with expenses increasing 2% in fiscal 2021, 3% in fiscal 2020, 3.7% in fiscal 2019 and a significant 7.7% in fiscal 2018. We expect that this ongoing increase in expenses to continue to exert pressure on ADP&#39;s bottom-line performance in the foreseeable future.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Automatic Data Processing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Business Services sector are <strong>AppLovin </strong>APP and<strong> Barrett Business Services </strong>BBSI.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AppLovin presently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">APP has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 20%. It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 21.1%, on average.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Barrett Business Services currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. It has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 15%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BBSI delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 31.9%, on average.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328490/acquisitions-aid-automatic-data-processing-amid-rising-expenses?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|zer_report_update-2328490">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ All You Need to Know About Bellway (BLWYY) Rating Upgrade to Buy ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 16:00:11 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Bellway (BLWYY) appears an attractive pick, as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

<![CDATA[ <p>Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be "buying high, but hoping to sell even higher." With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.</p><p>Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.</p><p>Below, we take a look at <b>CareTrust REIT (CTRE)</b>, which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. CareTrust REIT currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.</p><p>You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>></p><p><h2>Set to Beat the Market?</h2></p><p>In order to see if CTRE is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this health care real estate investment trust holds up.</p><p>Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.</p><p>For CTRE, shares are up 4.96% over the past week while the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry is up 3.92% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 9.75% compares favorably with the industry's 1.39% performance as well.</p><p>Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of CareTrust REIT have increased 12.69% over the past quarter, and have gained 46.5% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 6.41% and 29.26%, respectively.</p><p>Investors should also take note of CTRE's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, CTRE is averaging 1,541,973 shares for the last 20 days.</p><p><h2>Earnings Outlook</h2></p><p>The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CTRE.</p><p>Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CTRE's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.45 to $1.48 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CTRE is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep CareTrust REIT on your short list.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328448/caretrust-reit-ctre-is-up-4-96-in-one-week-what-you-should-know?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_10-2328448">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 6.41% and 29.26%, respectively.</p><p>Investors should also pay attention to CAIXY's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. CAIXY is currently averaging 135,519 shares for the last 20 days.</p><p><h2>Earnings Outlook</h2></p><p>The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well.

Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CAIXY is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep CaixaBank, S.A. Unsponsored ADR on your short list.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328447/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-caixabank-s-a-unsponsored-adr-caixy-is-a-great-choice?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_10-2328447">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ What Makes Criteo S.A. (CRTO) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be "buying high, but hoping to sell even higher." And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.</p><p>While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.</p><p>Below, we take a look at <b>Criteo S.A. (CRTO)</b>, which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Criteo S.A. Currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.</p><p>You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>></p><p><h2>Set to Beat the Market?</h2></p><p>In order to see if CRTO is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this company holds up.</p><p>Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.</p><p>For CRTO, shares are up 1.57% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Software and Services industry is up 0.12% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.47% compares favorably with the industry's 0.83% performance as well.</p><p>While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Criteo S.A. Have risen 25.34%, and are up 63.31% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 6.41% and 29.26%, respectively.</p><p>Investors should also take note of CRTO's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, CRTO is averaging 415,671 shares for the last 20 days.</p><p><h2>Earnings Outlook</h2></p><p>The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CRTO.</p><p>Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CRTO's consensus estimate, increasing from $3.72 to $4.17 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that CRTO is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Criteo S.A. On your short list.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328446/what-makes-criteo-s-a-crto-a-strong-momentum-stock-buy-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_10-2328446">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Alaska Air Stock Plunges 12% in 3 Months: Should You Buy the Dip? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Seattle, WA-based airline heavyweight&nbsp;<strong>Alaska Air Group, Inc. </strong>(ALK<strong>) </strong>have not had a good time on the bourses of late, declining in double-digits over the past 90 days. The disappointing price performance resulted in ALK underperforming its&nbsp;industry in the said time frame as well as the S&amp;P 500, of which the airline is a key member. However, ALK&rsquo;s price performance compares favorably with that of fellow U.S. airline operators <strong>United Airlines</strong>&nbsp;UAL and <strong>Delta Air Lines</strong> DAL in the same time frame.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Three-Month Price Comparison</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/bb/75722.jpg?v=106014797" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently trading at $35.78, the stock rebounded 16.35% from its 52-week low of $30.75 on Nov. 1, 2023. However, it still reflects a significant discount of 22.47% from its 52-week high of $46.15 reached on April 22.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, Alaska Air shares have plummeted 40.3% over the past five years.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the significant pullback in ALK&rsquo;s shares currently, investors might be tempted to snap up the stock. But is this the right time to buy ALK? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p><h2>ALK&rsquo;s Bearish Guidance for the Current Year</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Last month, Alaska Air reported lower-than-expected revenues for the second quarter of 2024. Additionally, the airline trimmed its earnings per share forecast for 2024, citing the impacts of the newly signed tentative agreement with flight attendants and moderating domestic revenue environment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The practice of price cuts by low-cost carriers, as they struggle to fill the excess seats this summer, is hurting even bigger rivals. Discount carriers have added too many seats that they are now attempting to fill by lowering fares and compelling airline majors to do the same to stay competitive. This phenomenon dampened Alaska Air&rsquo;s pricing power. ALK now anticipates 2024 earnings per share between $3.50 and $4.50 (prior view: $3.25 and $5.25). The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.08 lies within the updated guidance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Capacity (measured in available seat miles) for 2024 is now expected to increase less than 2.5% (prior view: less than 3%) from 2023 actuals.</p><h2>Rising Expenses Weigh on Alaska Air Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the pricing and capacity woes, rise in labor and airport costs are also likely to dent bottom-line growth by resulting in a spike in operating expenses. Evidently, operating expenses were up 2% during the first half of 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The surge in operating expenses was mainly caused by an increase in labor costs and fuel expenses. Expenses on wages and benefits increased 7% in the first half of 2024 over 2022 actuals. Consolidated operating costs per available seat mile (excluding fuel and special items) rose 4% year over year to 10.67 cents in the first half of 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The ongoing production cuts adopted by major oil-producing nations and geopolitical tensions are pushing up fuel costs.&nbsp; As fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any airline player, the uptick in these costs naturally does not bode well. Notably, the economic fuel cost per gallon increased 3% in second-quarter 2024 to $2.84. For third-quarter 2024, economic fuel price per gallon is expected to be in the $2.85-$2.95 per gallon range, which is again higher than the reported figure in the second quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the headwinds surrounding the stock, earnings estimates have been southbound, as shown below.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/45/75726.jpg?v=709403914" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Upbeat Air Travel Demand: A Major Tailwind</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Strong passenger volumes bode well for ALK. While air travel demand is particularly strong on the leisure front, business travel has also made an encouraging comeback. Driven by the air travel demand strength, ALK&rsquo;s top line increased 2% year over year in the first half of 2024. This was driven by a 2% rise in passenger revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To meet the upbeat demand, ALK is boosting capacity. For third-quarter 2024, the company expects capacity to increase in the range of 2-3% from third-quarter 2023 actuals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">From a valuation perspective, ALK is trading at a discount compared to the industry, going by its forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio. The reading is also below its median over the last five years. The company has a Value Score of A.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ec/75725.jpg?v=476848071" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>To Conclude</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">It is understood that ALK stock is attractively valued and upbeat passenger revenues are contributing to ALK&rsquo;s top line. However, given the abovementioned headwinds, we believe that it is not at all advisable to buy the dip in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock until the company demonstrates substantial improvement in its performance. We believe investors should monitor the company&rsquo;s developments closely for an appropriate entry point. For those who already own the stock, it will be prudent to stay invested.&nbsp; The stock&rsquo;s Zacks Rank supports our thesis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong><strong>. </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328430/alaska-air-stock-plunges-12-in-3-months-should-you-buy-the-dip?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2328430">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Interactive Brokers Allows Clients to Trade Stocks on Bursa Malaysia ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 15:59:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s IBKR clients are now allowed to trade stocks on one of the largest stock exchanges in Southeast Asia, Bursa Malaysia. The brokerage firm&rsquo;s clients will be able to trade Malaysian Ringgit-denominated equities and exchange traded funds (ETFs), along with global stocks, options, futures, currencies, bonds and funds from a single unified platform.<br /><br />By providing access to Malaysia-denominated equity products, IBKR will be able to expand the breadth of global investment products available on the Interactive Brokers platform and offer its clients new investment opportunities across Malaysia&rsquo;s economy.<br /><br />IBKR has decided to coordinate the necessary forex trade using an automatic FX conversion between the base currency selected in a client&rsquo;s account and the Malaysian Ringgit, using a conversion rate determined based on the prevailing foreign exchange market rates. This will help streamline trading as it will eliminate the need for pre-trade currency conversions.<br /><br />David Friedland, the head of APAC at IBKR, stated, &ldquo;Interactive Brokers offers clients worldwide superior market and product access, allowing them to create diversified portfolios across geographies and asset classes. Introducing stocks on the Bursa Malaysia allows our clients to add exposure to Malaysian equities with the benefit of having Interactive Brokers manage the cost associated with currency conversion.&rdquo;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Other Moves by IBKR to Expand Scope of Trading</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Interactive Brokers has been aiming to boost its offerings and expand its global footprint.<br /><br />In June 2024, the company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, ForecastEx LLC, obtained the requisite approvals from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to operate as a contract market and derivative clearing organization, thus becoming the first Futures Commission Merchant to become a member of this exchange.<br /><br />In May 2024, IBKR launched crypto trading in the U.K., expanding its scope of digital asset exposure. Moreover, with the launch of IBKR GlobalTrader, investors globally can trade stocks through mobile applications. IBKR is one of the first brokers to introduce Overnight Trading on U.S. stocks and ETFs nearly 24 hours a day, five days a week.<br /><br />The launch of IBKR Lite has enabled investors to trade commission free and is, thus, expected to improve the company&rsquo;s market share. Also, the launch of Impact Dashboard, an innovative sustainable investing tool, has made IBKR the first major brokerage firm to allow investors to easily align their portfolios with their values.<br /><br />Along with these expansion efforts, Interactive Brokers has mainly been focusing on developing proprietary software to automate broker-dealer functions, which has resulted in a steady improvement in the company&rsquo;s revenues. IBKR&rsquo;s total net revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate of 17.9% over the last five years (2018-2023), with the uptrend continuing in the first quarter of 2024. We anticipate GAAP revenues to increase 11.7% in 2024.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">IBKR&rsquo;s Price Performance &amp; Zacks Rank</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past six months, IBKR shares have gained 16.9% compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 13.4%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b5/75671.jpg?v=836845751" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, Interactive Brokers sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Like IBKR, Other Finance Firms Expand Asia Footprint</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this month, <strong>Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. </strong>MUFG and its consolidated subsidiary &mdash; MUFG Bank &mdash; announced that they were investing in Globe Fintech Innovations, Inc. (&ldquo;Mynt&rdquo;), the firm that manages GCash. It was reported that MUFG would invest $393 million in Mynt to extend its foothold in Asia&rsquo;s booming digital financial market.<br /><br />Globe Fintech Innovations operates the Philippine mobile wallet GCash, specializing in QR code-based mobile payments with a user base of more than 60 million.

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>The Gap, Inc.</strong> GAP is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 29, after the closing bell.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second-quarter bottom line is pegged at 39 cents per share, suggesting 14.7% growth from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. The consensus estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings has moved down 7.1% in the past seven days. For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $3.6 billion, indicating a 1.9% rise from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.<br /><br />The San Francisco, CA-based company has been reporting steady earnings outcomes, as evident from its positive top and bottom-line surprise trends in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, the company&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 192.9%. GAP has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 202.7%, on average. Given its positive record, the question arises: can GAP maintain the momentum?</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3><p>&nbsp;</p> <img alt="The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="263" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/08/1724854399.png" title="" width="536" /> <p>The Gap, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Gap, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2>Earnings Whispers</h2><p>Our proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Gap this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />Gap currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.47% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>What to Expect from GAP&rsquo;s Q2 Earnings: Key Trends</h2><p><br />Gap&rsquo;s second-quarter fiscal 2024 results are expected to reflect its ability to gain market share and revive its brand&rsquo;s position. Management has been committed to creating a trend-right merchandise assortment, deepening relations with customers via marketing, enhancing the digital commerce agenda and efficiently controlling expenses. Gains from these actions are expected to have bolstered the company&rsquo;s performance in second-quarter fiscal 2024.<br /><br />Old Navy&rsquo;s emphasis on value-driven fashion and Athleta&rsquo;s strong position in the thriving activewear market present significant growth opportunities. The company&rsquo;s management has been on track to turn around the performance of its namesake brand, bringing back its heritage of offering &lsquo;every generation&rsquo; merchandise. Gap is also making strides in repositioning Banana Republic to excel in the premium lifestyle segment. This is likely to have boosted sales across the company&rsquo;s brands.<br /><br />Our model predicts fiscal second-quarter sales to increase 4% at Gap Global, 2% at Old Navy Global, and 1.1% each at Banana Republic Global and Athleta Global.<br /><br />Moreover, the company&rsquo;s second-quarter fiscal 2024 performance is expected to have gained from improved margins, driven by lower airfreight and increased promotional activity. Lower advertising expenses and technology investments from cost-saving actions also bode well. The company has been aggressively undertaking cost-management actions, which are expected to have improved its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.<br /><br />On the last reported quarter&rsquo;s earnings call, management expected gross margin expansion of at least 300 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This is likely to have been backed by merchandise margin expansion and commodity cost tailwinds. Notably, the company has been taking a prudent approach toward the promotional environment.<br /><br />We expect an adjusted gross margin expansion of 300 basis points for the fiscal second quarter, backed by gains from higher merchandise margins, lower commodity costs and better promotional activity.<br /><br />Uncertain macro and consumer environments are expected to have taken a toll on Gap&rsquo;s top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Higher operating expenses are likely to have hurt the company&#39;s profitability.<br /><br />On the last reported quarter&rsquo;s earnings call, management expected operating expenses to rise 5% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from the adjusted SG&amp;A reported last year, owing to the timing shifts in incentive accruals and advertising expenses. Our model predicts year-over-year adjusted operating expense growth of 4.9% for the fiscal second quarter.</p><h2>Gap&rsquo;s Price Performance &amp; Valuation Look Promising</h2><p><br />The company&rsquo;s shares have exhibited an uptrend in the past month, rising 4.7%, leaving behind its industry peers and the Zacks Consumer Staples sector. In the past year, the apparel retailer&rsquo;s shares have surged 109.8%, outperforming the industry&rsquo;s growth of 24.8% and the sector&rsquo;s rise of 20%.<br /><br />The Gap stock has displayed a significant rally compared with <strong>Deckers Outdoor</strong> DECK, <strong>American Eagle Outfitters Inc.</strong> AEO and <strong>Nordstrom</strong>&rsquo;s JWN growth of 80.5%, 37% and 34.9%, respectively, in the past year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9d/75771.jpg?v=154974089" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the current price of $23.28, the stock trades at a 31.4% discount to its 52-week high of $30.59 reached on Jun 3, 2024.<br /><br />From a valuation perspective, Gap shares present an attractive opportunity, trading at a discount than historical and industry benchmarks. With a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 12.65X, below the Retail - Apparel &amp; Shoes industry&rsquo;s average of 16.92X, the stock offers compelling value for investors seeking exposure to the sector. Additionally, the stock currently has a Value Score of A, further validating its appeal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/84/75773.jpg?v=1835452565" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Investment Thesis</h2><p>Gap has carved out a niche with its four distinct brands &mdash; Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta &mdash; each catering to different market segments and providing diverse revenue streams. Its recent turnaround underscores the resilience of its business model and effective cost-management strategies.<br /><br />The company is poised to strategically position itself for sustained growth, with a focus on curating trend-right merchandise, strengthening customer relationships through marketing, advancing its digital commerce agenda and efficiently managing costs. By leveraging its rich retail heritage and a portfolio of iconic brands, it has undertaken multiple initiatives to ensure long-term success in a rapidly evolving retail landscape.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As Gap gets ready to release its second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings, positive factors like brand strength, digital transformation, sustainability, global expansion, product innovation, operational efficiency, strong leadership and a consumer-centric approach are promising indicators. The company&rsquo;s ongoing initiatives position it to effectively navigate the challenges of the modern retail landscape and emerge even stronger. Given its strong fundamentals, Gap is a solid long-term buy, regardless of what course its stock takes after the second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results.<br /><br />Gap&rsquo;s robust share price performance, combined with a relatively lower valuation than peers, offers an attractive opportunity for investors looking to invest in this profitable apparel retailer before its second-quarter fiscal 2024 results. If you already hold the GAP stock in your portfolio, sit tight, as the upcoming earnings report is likely to confirm the company&#39;s strong performance.<br /><br />Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328486/is-it-worth-adding-the-gap-stock-to-your-portfolio-pre-q2-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2328486">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ The Zacks Containers - Paper and Packaging industry will continue to benefit from solid demand from consumer-oriented end-markets, as packaging is integral to product distribution. Booming e-commerce activities, and rising demand for sustainable and eco-friendly packaging options due to increasing environmental concerns will continue to drive the industry&rsquo;s growth. Pricing actions implemented by industry players will help offset the impacts of the ongoing supply-chain disruptions and rising costs.<br /><br />Companies like <strong>Packaging Corporation of America</strong> PKG, <strong>Brambles Limited </strong>BXBLY, <strong>AptarGroup</strong> ATR and <strong>Greif, Inc.</strong> GEF are set to gain from the demand trends.<p><b>Industry Description</b></p><p>The Zacks Containers - Paper and Packaging industry comprises companies that manufacture paper and plastic packaging products. The packaging solutions provided by the industry help protect and preserve products, extend the shelf life, and cut down on wastage and loss across the wide and lengthy range of distribution channels. The products range from containerboard and corrugated packaging to flexible and rigid plastic packaging. Some companies manufacture dispensing pumps, closures, aerosol valves and applicators for the beauty, personal, home care and healthcare markets. The industry serves a wide array of markets, including food, beverage, food services and other consumer products, such as beauty, personal care and home care. The players also cater to the chemical, agribusiness, medical, pharmaceutical, electronics and industrial markets, to name a few.</p><p><b>What's Shaping the Future of the Containers - Paper and Packaging Industry</b></p><p><em><strong>E-commerce Acts as a Key Catalyst</strong></em>: With the rise of e-commerce, packaging has gained the utmost importance, as it helps maintain the integrity of the product and withstand the complexities of delivery. In 2023, e-commerce accounted for more than 19% of retail sales worldwide. The same is projected to increase to 25% by 2027. According to Statista, global e-commerce sales are expected to see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.5% between 2024 and 2029. Turkey is expected to lead the retail e-commerce development with a projected CAGR of 11.58% over this period, closely followed by Brazil and India. The U.S. retail e-commerce market is expected to cross the $1-trillion mark in 2027 and grow at a CAGR of 9% over 2024-2029. China is expected to reach $2 trillion in 2027. Also, given the industry&rsquo;s significant exposure (more than 60%) to consumer-oriented end markets, such as food and beverages and healthcare, the demand for packaging applications has been stable across economic cycles.<br /><br /><em><strong>Demand for Eco-Friendly Packaging to Aid Industry</strong></em>: The preference for environmentally friendly biodegradable packaging materials is witnessing a steady rise globally, courtesy of customers&rsquo; increasing awareness. The industry is constantly striving to meet the same by adopting the latest technology and bringing innovative products. Industry players have begun incorporating recycled content into production methods. By maximizing recycling, the industry can implement environmentally and economically sustainable production methods.</p><p><em><strong>Pricing to Counter Impacts of Costs on Margins</strong></em>: The industry participants continue to witness higher raw material costs, stemming from various factors like general inflationary pressure, limited availability of certain raw materials and global transportation disruptions. Higher labor, transportation and chemical costs aggravated their woes. The shortage of labor is another concern. The companies have been implementing cost-reduction actions for a while, which are likely to sustain margins. Players focus on streamlining their operations and realigning with high-growth key markets to bolster their performances.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects</b></p><p>The Zacks Containers - Paper and Packaging industry is a 10-stock group within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #59, which places it at the top 24% of the 251 Zacks industries.<br /><br />The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright prospects in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p>Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group&#39;s earnings growth potential. The industry&#39;s earnings estimates for the year have moved up 2% from that provided at the beginning of 2024.<br /><br />Before we present a few Containers - Paper and Packaging stocks that can be retained in one&rsquo;s portfolio, it is worth taking a look at the industry&rsquo;s stock-market performance and valuation picture.</p><p><b>Industry Versus Broader Market</b></p><p>The Containers - Paper and Packaging industry has outperformed its sector but lagged the S&amp;P 500 over the past year. The industry has gained 15.6% compared with the sector&rsquo;s growth of 14.5%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 24.7%.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One-Year Price Performance</h2><h2 style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/cont_20240828.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 278px;" /><br /><br />&nbsp;</h2><p><b>Industry's Current Valuation</b></p><p>The forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly used multiple for valuing Containers - Paper and Packaging companies, shows that the industry is currently trading at 19.90 compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 14.69 and the Industrial Products sector&rsquo;s forward 12-month EV/EBITDA of 19.67. This is shown in the charts below.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) F12M Ratio</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/contvalsp_20240828.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 205px;" /></p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) F12M Ratio</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/contvalsec_20240828.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 205px;" /></p><p>Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 26.66X and as low as 14.15X, with the median at 18.71X.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><b>4 Containers - Paper and Packaging Stocks to Buy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Brambles</strong>: The company recently reported fiscal 2024 results, with revenues improving 7% year over year attributed to pricing actions and increased volumes. Underlying profit rose 17% at constant currency, reflecting pricing growth combined with the company&rsquo;s asset productivity initiatives. Also, backed by strong cash flows, the company increased its annual dividend by 30% to 34 cents per share. BXBLY&rsquo;s focus on asset efficiency and network productivity has strengthened its business, optimized operations and reduced the capital intensity of the business. The company is also advancing its digital transformation plans. In sync with this, automation investments made across its service centers have been delivering cost savings while improving efficiency. BXBLY shares have gained 32.5% in the past three months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Sydney, Australia-based company&rsquo;s ongoing year&rsquo;s earnings has moved up 11% in the past 60 days. The estimate indicates year-over-year growth of 9.7%. BXBLY currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="pd4ml-display: none; pd4ml-visibility: hidden;">You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>. </span></p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price: BXBLY</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/bxbly_20240828.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 333px;" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Packaging Corp</strong>: The company has been witnessing strong demand for corrugated products and containerboards lately. Prices and mix are expected to be up in both Packaging and Paper segments in the ongoing quarter as the company continues to implement previously announced increases, along with higher containerboard export prices. Although there will be one less shipping day for the corrugated business in the third quarter, volumes and shipments per day will likely be higher, setting a third-quarter record. The company will gain from robust e-commerce activities that continue to support packaging demand. The requirement for food, beverages, medication and other consumer products will help sustain the packaging segment&rsquo;s growth. Backed by its solid balance sheet, the company will be able to invest in boosting capacity and acquisitions to capitalize on these trends. PKG shares have gained 15.2% in the past three months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Packaging Corp&rsquo;s ongoing year&rsquo;s earnings has been revised 5% upward in the past 60 days. PKG has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.6%, on average. The Lake Forest, IL-based company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 4.4%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price: PKG</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/pkg_20240828.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 330px;" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AptarGroup</strong>: The company&rsquo;s Beauty segment will continue to gain from improved trends in beauty and personal care markets. The Pharma segment is seeing steady demand growth for prescription and consumer healthcare. Given the sales momentum in elastomer components and active material solutions, AptarGroup is expanding its capacity to produce elastomer components for injected medicines and active material science solutions, which will drive near-term growth. The company is progressing well on its business transformation plan that will drive top-line growth, boost operational excellence, enhance its approach to innovation and improve organizational effectiveness. Backed by its efforts to bring the latest products into the market, the company remains the preferred choice for renowned brands worldwide. Focus on acquisitions to expand the scope of technologies, geographic presence and product offerings will also aid growth. Shares of ATR have gained 4.6% over the past three months.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AptarGroup&rsquo;s fiscal 2024 earnings has been unchanged in the past 60 days. The figure indicates year-over-year growth of 12%. This Crystal Lake, IL-based company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.2%, on average. The stock estimated a long-term growth rate of 9% and has a Zacks Rank #2 at present.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price: ATR</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/atr_20240828.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 333px;" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Greif</strong>: The company continues to make strategic acquisitions to expand its geographic reach and its product portfolio. In March 2024, it closed the acquisition of IPACKCHEM, which is a global leader in premium barrier, and non-barrier jerry cans and small plastic containers. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Greif&rsquo;s EBITDA margin and free cash flow.&nbsp; The company has been implementing cost-rationalization measures within its system, which has led to a solid free cash flow performance. It will continue to benefit from its focus on operational execution, capital discipline, and a strong and diverse product portfolio. Its recent price increases in response to raw material, energy, labor and transportation cost hikes will aid revenues. GEF recently sold Delta Petroleum Company, Inc., a North American filling and logistics services business, as it no longer aligns with Greif&rsquo;s core growth strategy of expansion into resin-based industrial products serving higher-growth and less cyclical end markets. GEF shares have gained 1% over the past three months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GEF&rsquo;s fiscal 2024 earnings has been revised 1.6% upward over the past 60 days. Greif has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 143.4%, on average. The Delaware, OH-based company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price: GEF</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/gef_20240828.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 332px;" /></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2328451/4-containers-paper-and-packaging-stocks-to-buy-in-a-promising-industry?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-industry_outlook-2328451">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">A critical lesson savvy investors understand is that political leanings, bias, and opinions need to be left at the door when it comes to making money in the long run on Wall Street. Don&rsquo;t just take it from me; take it from the world&rsquo;s greatest value investor &ndash; Warren Buffett. In a 1994 quote, &ldquo;The Oracle of Omaha&rdquo; underscored the importance of ignoring political and economic distractions:</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><em>&ldquo;We will continue to ignore political and economic forecasts, which are an expensive distraction for many investors and businessmen. Thirty years ago, no one could have foreseen the huge expansion of the Vietnam War, wage and price controls, two oil shocks, the resignation of a president, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a one-day drop in the Dow of 508 points, or treasury bull yields fluctuating between 2.8% and 17.4%.</em></strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong><em>A different set of major shocks is sure to occur in the next 30 years. We will neither try to predict these nor to profit from them. If we can identify businesses similar to those we have purchased in the past, external surprises similar will have little effect on our long-term results.&rdquo;</em></strong></span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Does the Market do Better Under a Republican or Democratic President?</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Using data dating back to the 1950s, the binary answer is Democrats. However, there are few binary answers to questions on Wall Street, and presidential politics is no different. Historical data proves that the U.S. stock market trends up over time, regardless of who is in office. Though you would have outperformed Republican presidential periods if you only had the choice to invest in one party or the other, the right move by far was to be invested throughout the presidencies of both major U.S. political parties.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/68/75735.png?v=1257561926" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Bespoke Investment Group, Carson Investment Research, FactSet</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In other words, investors need to come to terms with the fact that the U.S. president has less of an impact on the market than the media and the candidates themselves would have you believe. All you have to do to prove this fact is to consult a long-term chart of the S&amp;P 500 index.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f4/75737.png?v=438271365" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>How Does Gridlock Factor Impact Stocks?</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In a unified government (defined as one party holding power of the presidency, the House of Representatives, and the Senate), Republicans enjoy a slight edge over Democrats (using data from 1926-2023). The best outcome is a divided government with a Democratic President, but again, stocks tend to move higher over the long-run regardless of who&rsquo;s in power.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fd/75734.png?v=1434803743" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: retirmentresearcher.com</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Market Volatility Pre-Election is Normal</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Though we have underscored the fact that stocks move higher in the long-term, historical seasonality trends illustrate how markets dislike uncertainty in the short-term. On average, stocks are lower in the back half of September and October during election years.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/40/75733.png?v=1540143698" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Seasonax</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Stocks to Watch Post-Election</strong></span></span></h2><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Bitcoin, Crypto, and the Election</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Like the equity market, Bitcoin has performed well under both Republicans and Democrats. However, you would probably rather see a Donald Trump presidency if you own Bitcoin or crypto proxies like the <strong>iShares Bitcoin ETF (</strong></span></span>IBIT<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>)</strong> or <strong>Coinbase (</strong></span></span>COIN<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>)</strong>. While Kamala Harris has remained relatively reserved on the crypto topic, Trump has evolved on the industry and has gone out of his way to embrace it. Former President Donald Trump went out of his way to speak at the Bitcoin Conference earlier this year and embraced crypto while vowing to &ldquo;<strong><em>Appoint an SEC chair who will build the future, not block the future.&rdquo;</em></strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">From a regulatory standpoint, Trump is clearly the optimal choice for the crypto crowd. Still, neither party has shown the ability or intention of controlling debt, which should put a bid under assets like Bitcoin over the next few years.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3c/75732.png?v=1280709015" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: CBO</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>What Does the Election Mean for Clean Energy Stocks?</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Harris and the Democrats have the advantage regarding clean energy stocks. The Biden-Harris administration passed the Clean Energy for America Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, providing incentives for clean energy companies like <strong>First Solar (</strong></span></span>FSLR<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>)</strong> and <strong>Tesla (</strong></span></span>TSLA<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>).</strong> Meanwhile, Donald Trump has promised to end incentives for EVs and other clean energy segments.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>How will Immigration Policy Impact Stocks?</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While Kamala Harris appears to be evolving and moving more to the middle on immigration, the topic is a crucial pillar for Trump. A stock to watch closely is <strong>GEO Group (</strong></span></span>GEO<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>),</strong> which runs immigration detention facilities. Harris once promised a voter that she would shut down immigration detention facilities<strong><em>&ldquo;on day one.&rdquo; </em></strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Bottom Line</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Historical data teaches us that Presidential politics have less to do with stock market returns than most voters would think. However, by studying the numbers, investors can make more informed decisions, regardless of the outcome in November.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2328324/trump-vs-harris-what-the-election-means-for-stocks?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-investment_ideas-2328324">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ MasterCraft Boat to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>MasterCraft Boat Holdings, Inc. </strong>MCFT is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug. 29, 2024, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 60.9%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How Are Estimates Placed for MCFT?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MasterCraft Boat&#39;s fiscal fourth-quarter loss per share is pegged at 22 cents. In the prior-year quarter, MCFT reported an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.37. The estimated figure has remained unchanged in the past 30 days.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC. Price and EPS Surprise</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC. Price and EPS Surprise" height="263" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/2d/1724850741.png" title="" width="538" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC. price-eps-surprise | MASTERCRAFT BOAT HOLDINGS, INC. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at nearly $63.7 million. The metric suggests a plunge of 61.8% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s figure.<br />&nbsp;<br />Let&#39;s look at how things have shaped up in the quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Shaping MCFT&rsquo;s Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s fiscal fourth-quarter performance is likely to have been impacted by lower unit volume and increased dealer incentives, as the retail environment remains very competitive. Inflationary cost increases, higher interest rates and supply chain disruptions are expected to have affected the results. Also, its performance in the to-be-reported quarter is likely to have been impacted by dealers&#39; cautious ordering due to high inventories and elevated carrying costs.<br /><br />Dismal contributions from MasterCraft, Aviara and Crest segments are likely to be reflected in the fiscal fourth-quarter top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter MasterCraft and Aviara revenues is pegged at $47.8 million and $10 million, indicating a decline of 62.9% and 20.4% year over year, respectively. The consensus mark for Crest revenues is pegged at $7.1 million, suggesting a decline from $24.7 million reported in the prior-year quarter.<br /><br />MCFT&#39;s proactive steps in production planning, inventory management and dealer incentives are likely to have aided its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. MasterCraft Boat&#39;s focus on balancing dealer inventories with retail demand and reducing planned production for the rest of the fiscal year is expected to support dealer health and improve overall performance. The consensus mark for Aviara sales unit volume is pegged at 40, calling for an increase from 34 reported in the prior-year quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What the Zacks Model Unveils</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for MasterCraft Boat this time. A stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. But that&#39;s not the case here.<br /><br /><strong>Earnings ESP:</strong> MasterCraft Boat has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank: </strong>The company has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Recent Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Williams-Sonoma Inc. </strong>WSM reported mixed results for second-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended July 30, 2024).<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but net revenues missed the same. On a year-over-year basis, the top line declined but the bottom line increased on the back of the two-for-one stock split completed in July.<br /><br /><strong>Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.</strong> RRGB posted mixed second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues beating the same.<br /><br />The top line increased year over year while the bottom line fell from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s level.<br /><br /><strong>Brinker International, Inc. </strong>EAT reported mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues beating the same.<br /><br />In fiscal 2025, management anticipates total revenues to be in the range of $4.55-$4.62 billion. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the $195-$215 million band. EAT projects fiscal 2025 EPS to be in the range of $3.8-$4, down from the prior estimate of $4.35-$4.75.<br /><br />Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328482/mastercraft-boat-to-report-q4-earnings-what-s-in-the-cards?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2328482">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Why Viking Therapeutics Stock Price Moved Down 6% on Tuesday ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>Viking Therapeutics </strong>VKTX fell 6% on Tuesday after pharma giant <strong>Eli Lilly </strong>LLY announced the launch of single-dose vials of its popular obesity drug, Zepbound (tirzepatide). These new vials are priced at least 50% lower than the list price of&nbsp;competing GLP-1 medicines for obesity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A four-week supply of the 2.5 mg vials has been priced at $399 while the same for the 5 mg dose will cost $549. Zepbound is available in a single-dose pen (autoinjector), which is priced at about $1,000 for a month&rsquo;s supply. The newer versions of the drug will be launched without an autoinjector and patients will require a syringe to inject themselves.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Through this launch, Lilly intends to meet supply shortages for Zepbound, which has been experiencing high demand. The vials should be easier to manufacture than pens and can help improve supply.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These cheaper versions of Zepbound will be available through Lilly&rsquo;s direct-to-consumer website called LillyDirect for self-pay by patients with a valid on-label prescription. The availability of these vials is expected to broaden access for obesity patients especially those without insurance.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Did Lilly&rsquo;s Move Impact VKTX Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Lilly&rsquo;s intent to launch these vials seems simple &mdash; it wants to strengthen its presence in the obesity market and also lower the use of compounded versions of Zepbound used in several pharmacies, weight loss clinics and medical spas.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While the move does benefit LLY, it sent Viking&rsquo;s stock down. It seems investors were concerned about the impact of Lilly&rsquo;s decision on the small biotech whose obesity drug is nearing late-stage development.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Though it does not have any marketed drugs in its portfolio, VKTX is one of the few biotechs that has shown immense potential in the obesity space, all thanks to the treatment potential of its investigational GLP-1 drug VK2735. The drug, which is being evaluated as a subcutaneous (SC) injection and as an oral pill, demonstrated superior weight reduction in clinical studies. While VKTX is making preparations to advance SC formulation to late-stage development, it intends to start a mid-stage study on the oral formulation of the drug in obesity patients before 2024-end.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date, Viking&rsquo;s shares have skyrocketed 230% against the industry&rsquo;s 0.1% fall.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/e0/75779.jpg?v=330391660" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Players in the GLP-1 Market</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Another company with an approved marketed drug that competes with Lilly in the GLP-1 space is <strong>Novo Nordisk </strong>NVO. Novo&rsquo;s semaglutide is approved as Ozempic pre-filled pen and Rybelsus oral tablet for type II diabetes and as Wegovy injection for weight management. NVO is also working to improve the supply of Wegovy in response to rising demand but has not been as successful as Lilly in its efforts. The launch of these affordable versions of Zepbound could put further pressure on Novo Nordisk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Amgen</strong> AMGN also has a GLP-1 receptor candidate, MariTide (maridebart cafraglutide), for obesity in its pipeline. Top line 52-week data from the phase II study on MariTide in adults with overweight or obesity is expected in late 2024. AMGN is planning to conduct a comprehensive phase III program on the candidate across obesity, obesity-related conditions and type-II diabetes. It plans to begin a phase II study on the candidate in type II diabetes in late 2024.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Market Potential in the Obesity Drugs Space</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the presence of pharma bigwigs like Lilly and Novo in this space, we believe that there is room for small biotechs like Viking Therapeutics, which is still a couple of years from making a regulatory filing for its obesity drug.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per research conducted by Goldman Sachs, the obesity market in the United States is expected to reach $130 billion by 2030. This is evident from the fact that despite raking in billions from sales of their respective obesity drugs, Lilly and Novo are still unable to cope with existing demand. The firms are not only investing heavily to optimize their respective production capacities but have also started evaluating multiple other novel obesity candidates.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Viking Therapeutics, Inc. Price</h2><p>&nbsp;</p> <img alt="Viking Therapeutics, Inc.

Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">VKTX Zacks Rank</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Viking Therapeutics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ Red Rock Resorts Rises 15% in 3 Months: How to Play the Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 15:48:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">In the past three months, <strong>Red Rock Resorts, Inc.</strong> RRR shares have gained 14.9%, underperforming the Zacks Gaming industry while riding above the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index. During the same time frame, the industry, the sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index grew 17.3%, 4.7% and 6.3%, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Price Performance</strong></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b3/75745.jpg?v=1433822677" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s ongoing Durango expansion project, along with its focus on operational discipline and opportunities to improve efficiency, continues to drive growth.<br /><br />During the first half of 2024, RRR witnessed increased visitation numbers and net theoretical wins thanks to the Durango property. So, based on these upward trends, it decided to expand the Durango property by adding over 25,000 square feet of additional casino space, including a new high-limit slot and bar area which will incorporate additional 230 slot machines to the casino floor, including 120 slot machines dedicated to its new high-limit room. RRR believes that this expansion initiative will expand its profit margin in the medium and the long term.<br /><br />Additionally, RRR is also optimistic about favorable trends in its hotel division thanks to the increasing occupancy and average daily rate across the hotel portfolio. For the upcoming quarters, the company expects to witness stability in the locals market and across its card database, thus, possible growth prospects for its business.</p><h2>RRR Trading Above 50 &amp; 200-Day Moving Average</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the recent decline, technical indicators suggest continued strong performance for Red Rock Resorts. From the graphical representation given below, it can be observed that the RRR stock is riding above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and 200-day SMA, signaling a bullish trend. The technical strength underscores positive market sentiment and confidence in RRR&rsquo;s financial health and prospects.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/30/75746.jpg?v=1192202754" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Red Rock Resorts&#39; Stock Pulls Back</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past month, shares of RRR have dwindled 3.2% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 0.3% decline, the sector&rsquo;s 3.4% growth and the S&amp;P 500 Index&rsquo;s 2.8% gain.<br /><br />The optimism regarding the prospects of Red Rock Resorts might have been under question after the bottom line reported in the recent earnings results declined year over year. The company&rsquo;s bottom line was hurt due to the increased expense structure driven by the ongoing Durango expansion project. Year to date, RRR witnessed a hike in its casino, food and beverage, and room expenses due to the increased expense scenario at the project related to these aspects. Also, during the same time frame, the selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses increased year over year to $216.1 million from $186 million.<br /><br />The expense increase trajectory is quite alarming for the company&rsquo;s near-term prospects, which is indeed hurting investor&rsquo;s sentiments.</p><h2>RRR&rsquo;s Estimate Revision Trend Signaling Downturn</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Red Rock Resorts&rsquo; 2024 earnings per share (EPS) has trended downward to $1.66 from $1.82 over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 43.5% decline in growth from the prior year&rsquo;s reported levels. Over the said time frame, the consensus estimate for third-quarter 2024 EPS also declined to 39 cents from 44 cents, indicating a 35% year-over-year decline. This declining trend induces concern among investors regarding the RRR stock&rsquo;s growth potential.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ed/75741.jpg?v=1470653894" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>RRR is Trading at a Premium</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Red Rock Resorts is currently trading at a premium to the industry peers on a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio basis. RRR&rsquo;s forward 12-month P/E ratio stands at 29.67X, higher than the industry&rsquo;s ratio of 27.85X. This indicates that despite the recent stock price decline in the past month, the stock is expensive on a relative basis.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ac/75742.jpg?v=1051219851" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Is it Profitable to Include RRR in Your Portfolio?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Red Rock Resorts is making effective efforts to increase the prospects of its long-term growth, substantiated by the Durango expansion project. Also, increased visitation and card slot play, along with upward demand trends across its hotel division, is encouraging. However, RRR&rsquo;s core strategy of reinvesting in existing properties is inflating the expense structure. The upsurge in expenses is directly hurting its bottom line, which is demotivational across the industry.<br /><br />In the context of the other industry players, including <strong>DraftKings Inc.</strong> DKNG, <strong>PENN Entertainment, Inc.</strong> PENN and <strong>Boyd Gaming Corporation</strong> BYD, RRR has only outperformed DKNG in the past three months and slid below the other two players. In the said time frame, shares of DKNG have lost 1.8%, while the shares of PENN and BYD have gained 28.6% and 18.5%, respectively.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8f/75744.jpg?v=1984605532" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">From the above discussion, it can be concluded that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is sending mixed signals regarding its prospects. RRR is currently trading at a premium compared to its industry peers, and its earnings estimates have been revised downward, reflecting concerns about near-term growth. That said, the stock is riding above its 50 and 200-day moving average, inducing bullish sentiments. It is advised to the existing investors to hold onto Red Rock Resorts shares for now, despite the recent challenges.

<![CDATA[ KnightSwift Down 49.5% YTD: What's Hurting the Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>KnightSwift Transportation </strong>KNX shares have declined 49.5% on a year-to-date basis compared to the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 5.9% fall. The S&amp;P 500 composite index rose 17.9% in the same time frame, while the Zacks&nbsp;Transportation&nbsp;sector gained 1.8%. This North America&rsquo;s largest and most diversified freight transportation company currently has a market capitalization of $8.35 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">KNX presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company has a disappointing track record of missing estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average miss being 30.9%.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">YTD Price Performance</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/85/75778.jpg?v=1802038349" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><strong>Factors Impeding KNX&#39;s Growth</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for KNX&rsquo;s 2024 earnings is pegged at $1.12 per share, which indicates a decline of 35% from 2023&rsquo;s actuals. The same for revenues stands at $7.61 billion, which implies a 3.5% decrease from the prior year&#39;s actual.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus mark for current-quarter earnings is pegged at 35 cents per share, indicating a 14.6% decline year over year. The same for revenues stands at $1.95 billion, which suggests a fall of 3.5% year over year. Weakness in freight demand is hurting revenues. High costs related to driver wages, equipment, maintenance, fuel and other expenses are hurting the bottom line.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">KNX&rsquo;s liquidity position is discouraging. The airline ended the second quarter of 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $336 million and a current ratio (a measure of liquidity) of 0.88. A current ratio of less than 1 implies that the company does not have sufficient cash to meet its current debt obligations. The company&rsquo;s times interest earned ratio of 1.5 compares unfavorably with the industry&rsquo;s ratio of 9.</p><h2><strong>Some Tailwinds to Consider for KNX Stock</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">KnightSwift posted a significant year-over-year increase of 18.9% in revenues in the second quarter of 2024 . The increase in the top line was driven by the acquisition of U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. (U.S. Xpress), effective July 1, 2023. Revenues, excluding truckload and LTL fuel surcharge, grew 18.1% year over year to $ 1.64 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Less-Than-Truckload segment generated revenues (excluding fuel surcharges) worth $263.09 million in the second quarter of 2024, up 15.1% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While Knight-Swift has areas of strength, the projected declines in earnings and revenues, combined with liquidity concerns, suggest that the company may face challenges in retaining its momentum.</p><h2><strong>Stocks to Consider</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks for investors&rsquo; consideration in the Zacks Transportation&nbsp;sector include <strong>C.H. Robinson Worldwide</strong> CHRW and <strong>ZIM Integrated Shipping Services</strong> ZIM.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">C.H. Robinson Worldwide currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;CHRW has an expected earnings growth rate of 25.2% for the current year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an average surprise of 7.3%. Shares of CHRW have risen 9.8% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ZIM also sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present and has an expected earnings growth rate of 257.2% for the current year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of ZIM have climbed 63.8% in the past year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328406/knightswift-down-49-5-ytd-what-s-hurting-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|price_surge_/_plunge-2328406">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.</p><p>Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.</p><p><h2>Unitil in Focus</h2></p><p>Unitil (UTL) is headquartered in Hampton, and is in the Utilities sector. The stock has seen a price change of 12.78% since the start of the year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.43 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.87%. In comparison, the Utility - Electric Power industry's yield is 3.34%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.56%.</p><p>Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.70 is up 4.9% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Unitil has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 2.77%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Unitil's current payout ratio is 56%. This means it paid out 56% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.</p><p>UTL is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $2.92 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 3.55%.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.</p><p>For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, UTL is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328408/are-you-looking-for-a-high-growth-dividend-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_5-2328408">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

Currently paying a dividend of $0.4 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.76%. In comparison, the Utility - Water Supply industry's yield is 2.19%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.56%.</p><p>Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.60 is up 5.3% from last year. Over the last 5 years, SJW has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 6.05%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, SJW's payout ratio is 58%, which means it paid out 58% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.</p><p>SJW is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is $2.76 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 2.99%.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>Investors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.</p><p>High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, SJW presents a compelling investment opportunity; it's not only an attractive dividend play, but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328411/are-you-looking-for-a-high-growth-dividend-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_5-2328411">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.</p><p>Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Spotify Technology S.A. </strong>SPOT has seen its stock skyrocket 80.6% year to date. This impressive performance has significantly outpaced the 20.1% rally of the industry it belongs to and the 17.8% growth of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of the last trading session, the stock closed at $339.47, close to its 52-week high of $359.38. SPOT is trading above its 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish sentiment among investors.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Year-to-Date Price Performance</h2><h2 style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/be/75756.jpg?v=1712337076" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the continuous strength in SPOT shares, investors might be tempted to buy the stock. But is this the right time to buy SPOT? Let&rsquo;s find out.</p><h2>SPOT&rsquo;s Financial Performance is Watch Worthy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Spotify investors have many reasons to be optimistic when it comes to the company&rsquo;s financial results. The company&#39;s premium subscriber revenues, which account for approximately 88% of total revenues, play a crucial role in its financial performance. Ad-supported revenues contribute the remaining 12%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Premium subscribers grew 12%, and ad-supported monthly active users (MAUs) increased 15% in the second quarter of 2024. The growth in total MAU was also noteworthy, with a 14% year-over-year increase. Spotify increased its gross profit by 45% year over year, expanding its gross margin by 510 basis points. It also turned an operating loss of $247 million into a profit of $266 million over the year. The adjusted eps of $1.43 marked a substantial 184.6% year-over-year jump.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Spotify&#39;s performance metrics have been bolstered by sustained price hikes, a loyal consumer base and significant cost reductions. The ability to raise prices while retaining and expanding its subscriber base is particularly noteworthy. This was the first quarter where premium subscriber growth outpaced ad-supported MAU growth sequentially, highlighting the effectiveness of Spotify&rsquo;s pricing strategy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The recent price hikes, alongside those by competitors such as <strong>Alphabet</strong>&#39;s GOOGL YouTube Premium, <strong>Apple</strong>&rsquo;s AAPL Music/TV, and <strong>Amazon</strong>&rsquo;s AMZN Music Unlimited, underscore the industry&#39;s trend toward higher pricing.</p><h2>Stock Valuation Suggests a Bargain</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the significant rally over the past year, Spotify&#39;s stock remains relatively undervalued, suggesting potential for further appreciation. The stock is trading at a trailing 12-month price/sales ratio of 4.47X compared to the industry average of 8.61X.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7f/75757.jpg?v=1501831365" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The trailing 12-month enterprise value/sales ratio stands at 3.95X compared to the industry average of 8.44X.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/72/75761.jpg?v=418897179" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Analysts&#39; Confidence Reflected in Rising Estimates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Six estimates for the third quarter of 2024 moved north over the past 60 days versus no southward revision. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2024 earnings has increased 34.8% to $1.82. Earnings are expected to grow 405.6% year over year in the quarter. Seven estimates for 2024 moved north over the past 60 days versus no southward revision. Over the same period, the consensus estimate for 2024 earnings has increased 27.7% to $6.32. Earnings are expected to grow 314.2% year over year in 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SPOT&rsquo;s third-quarter 2024 sales stands at $4.38 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 19.8%. Revenues for 2024 are expected to increase 19.4% year over year.</p><h2>Spotify is a Must-Buy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Spotify&#39;s strong financial position, promising top and bottom-line growth potential, and successful balance of higher subscription pricing with MAU growth make it an appealing investment. Management anticipates a sequential increase of 13 million in total MAUs, a 5 million rise in total premium subscribers, a $193 million revenue boost, a 100 basis point expansion in gross margin, and a $139 million increase in operating income for the third quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For investors looking to gain exposure to the music-streaming sector, Spotify&rsquo;s positive outlook and financial stability present a compelling opportunity following the earnings season. The company&#39;s inherent growth potential and strategic initiatives indicate that Spotify continues to be a valuable investment choice.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SPOT currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328405/spotify-stock-soars-81-year-to-date-should-you-invest-or-avoid?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2328405">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Wabtec Rises 29.9% YTD: More Upside Ahead for the Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation </strong>WAB,or Wabtec, shares have rallied 29.9% on a year-to-date basis compared with the industry&rsquo;s 5.9% decline. The S&amp;P 500 composite index rose 17.9% in the same time frame, while the Zacks&nbsp;Transportation&nbsp;sector gained 1.8%. The U.S.-based company currently has a market capitalization of $28.95 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Wabtec, presently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), boasts an impressive track record of beating estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 11.8%.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">YTD Price Performance</h3><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d6/75728.jpg?v=229226767" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><strong>Can WAB Retain the Momentum?</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB&rsquo;s 2024 earnings is pegged at $1.86 per share, which indicates an improvement of 9.4% from 2023&rsquo;s actuals. The same for revenues stands at $2.64 billion, which implies a 3.7% increase from the prior year&#39;s actual.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at $8.30 per share, which indicates 11.3% growth from 2024 estimates. The same for revenues is pegged at $10.82 billion, which indicates a rise of 4.2% from 2024 estimates. Wabtec&rsquo;s top line is benefiting from higher sales across its Freight and Transit segments. While the Freight segment benefits from growth in services and components, the Transit segment gains from strong aftermarket and original equipment manufacturing sales.<br /><br />Wabtec posted a significant year-over-year increase (9.85%) in revenues for 2023. The surge in the top line was driven by a 13% rise in Freight revenues (accounting for 72.6% of the top line). The ongoing summer season is expected to provide a further boost to revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">WAB&rsquo;s liquidity position is encouraging. The airline ended the second quarter of 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $595 million, much higher than the current debt level of $503 million. This implies that the company has sufficient cash to meet its current debt obligations. Wabtec&rsquo;s times interest earned ratio of 7.4 compares favorably with the industry&rsquo;s ratio of 3.2.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With WAB&rsquo;s health tied to the economy, we believe that the company will remain in good shape going forward as the economy has normalized after the pandemic. Sales should continue improving, given the uptick in the trading scenario.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the abovementioned upsides, one must be mindful of high fuel and labor costs, which pose major challenges for WAB.</p><h2><strong>Other Stocks to Consider</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other top-ranked stocks for investors&rsquo; consideration in the Zacks Transportation&nbsp;sector include <strong>C.H. Robinson Worldwide</strong> CHRW and <strong>ZIM Integrated Shipping Services</strong> ZIM.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">C.H. Robinson Worldwide currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;CHRW has an expected earnings growth rate of 25.2% for the current year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an average surprise of 7.3%. Shares of CHRW have risen 9.8% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ZIM also sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present and has an expected earnings growth rate of 257.2% for the current year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of ZIM have climbed 63.8% in the past year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328396/wabtec-rises-29-9-ytd-more-upside-ahead-for-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|price_surge_/_plunge-2328396">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ PGRE vs. EGP: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 15:40:10 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Investors interested in REIT and Equity Trust - Other stocks are likely familiar with Paramount Group (PGRE) and EastGroup Properties (EGP). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.</p><p>The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.</p><p>Paramount Group and EastGroup Properties are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that PGRE has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.</p><p>Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.</p><p>The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.</p><p>PGRE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.44, while EGP has a forward P/E of 23.81. We also note that PGRE has a PEG ratio of 0.25. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. EGP currently has a PEG ratio of 2.96.</p><p>Another notable valuation metric for PGRE is its P/B ratio of 0.27. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EGP has a P/B of 3.29.</p><p>These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PGRE's Value grade of A and EGP's Value grade of F.</p><p>PGRE sticks out from EGP in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that PGRE is the better option right now.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328401/pgre-vs-egp-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_3-2328401">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <strong>Vistra Corp.</strong> VST have rallied 183% over the past year compared with its industry&rsquo;s growth of 16.6%. Strong retail business and rising demand from its expanding customer base are boosting its performance.<br /><br />Vistra&rsquo;s hedging program saves the company from power price fluctuations and results in more stable earnings.<br /><br />Vistra&rsquo;s shares have outperformed its sector and the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One-Year Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/87/75748.jpg?v=1942729963" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Factors Acting as Tailwinds for VST Stock<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Vistra enjoys the benefit of increasing demand for clean electricity in its service region. The development of large load data centers and electrification of oil field operations, primarily in the Permian Basin, continue to boost demand for its services. The company also gained from the addition of new residential customers in its service area.<br /><br />Vistra&rsquo;s expertise in generating large volumes of clean electricity has earned it the selection of <strong>Microsoft Corporation</strong> MSFT and <strong>Amazon</strong> AMZN for long-term renewable power purchases. Vistra has started construction on two new solar facilities: a 200 megawatt (&ldquo;MW&rdquo;) site backed by AMZN in Texas and a 405 MW site backed by MSFT in Illinois.<br /><br />As of Aug. 5, 2024, Vistra has hedged nearly 94% of its expected generation volumes for the rest of 2024, around 86% for 2025, and about 55% for 2026. Vistra&#39;s comprehensive hedging program and recent forward price curves support its 2024 guidance range.<br /><br />The generation of clean electricity is an integral part of energy transition and Vistra has been adding clean sources in its generation sources through organic and inorganic means. Vistra has more than 70 sites with land and interconnects for the future development of clean energy projects. The company also received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate its Comanche Peak nuclear plant for an additional 20 years.</p><h2>VST&rsquo;s Earnings Estimates Move Up<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Vistra&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings per share reflect year-over-year growth of 35.4% and 41.1%, respectively. The upward revision in earnings estimates indicates analysts&rsquo; increasing confidence in the stock.<br /><br />VST&rsquo;s ongoing share repurchase of shares through its share repurchase program is also having a positive impact on its earnings per share.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b1/75749.jpg?v=524371326" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><br />Vistra&rsquo;s Capital Return Program<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Vistra continues to increase its shareholders&#39; value through its share repurchase program and dividend payments.<br /><br />Vistra has bought back shares worth over $4.25 billion from November 2021, resulting in a 29% reduction in outstanding shares from November 2021 levels. VST&rsquo;s management expects to continue with the buyback of shares and aims to repurchase at least $2.25 billion worth of outstanding shares between 2024 and 2025.<br /><br />VST&rsquo;s board of directors has also approved a quarterly dividend of 21.95 cents for the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a sequential increase of 1%. Check VST&rsquo;s dividend history here.</p><h2>VST&rsquo;s ROE Higher Than its Industry<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>VST&rsquo;s trailing 12-month return on equity is 21.1%, ahead of the industry average of 10.3%. Return on equity, a profitability measure, reflects how effectively a company is utilizing its shareholders&rsquo; funds in its operations to generate income.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3a/75752.jpg?v=1915924215" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>VST Stock Trades at a Discount<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>The company is currently trading at a discount compared with its industry on a forward 12-month P/E basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/28/75754.jpg?v=447317477" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3><br />Summing Up</h3><p>Vistra operates in a region where electricity demand is rising due to the development of large data centers and electrification in the Permian Basin region. The company is also expanding its clean energy generation portfolio to meet the rising demand.<br /><br />It is better to remain invested in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock and enjoy the benefits of dividends and rising earnings estimates.

The 172,000-square-foot lease of three buildings, originally set to expire in March 2025, has been extended until March 2030.</p><p>The demand for industrial real estate space has been high amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies.

<![CDATA[ Woodward (WWD) Up 9.5% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Woodward (WWD). Shares have added about 9.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.</p><p>Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Woodward due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Woodward Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Woodward reported third-quarter fiscal 2024 adjusted net earnings per share (EPS) of $1.63, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.9%. In the year-ago quarter, it reported adjusted net EPS of $1.37.<br /><br />Quarterly net sales increased 6% year over year to $848 million. Continued momentum in end-market demand and strong aerospace aftermarket sales resulted in this uptick. The top line missed the consensus estimate by 0.4%.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Segment Results</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Aerospace: Net sales were $518 million, up 8% year over year. Defense OEM sales were down 4% and defense aftermarket was up 22%.&nbsp; Commercial OEM sales were up 2% and commercial aftermarket sales increased 19%. Overall, aftermarket sales were supported by higher aircraft utilization. We predicted the metric to be $515.7 million.<br /><br />Segmental earnings were $102 million, up from $83 million a year ago. The increase in segment earnings was a result of price utilization in higher aftermarket volumes.<br /><br />Industrial: Net sales totaled $330 million, up 3% year over year. The rise in industrial sales was primarily driven by an 8% increase in power generation and a 3% jump in transportation.<br />&nbsp;<br />Industrial segment sales growth moderated year over year as expected due to relatively flat China on-highway sales. We expected the metric to be $320.2 million. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Sales for on-highway natural gas trucks in China were $55 million in the quarter under review. However, management expects further decline in the fiscal fourth quarter, with sales in the range of $10 million to $15 million.<br /><br />Segmental earnings were $60 million, up from $58 million in the year-ago quarter. Industrial earnings remained relatively flat as price realization was largely offset by inflation and an unfavorable mix.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Other Details</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Gross margin was up 160 basis points year over year to 27.1%.<br />Total costs and expenses were $725.6 million, up 4.4% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA was $161 million compared with $147 million a year ago.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Cash Flow &amp; Liquidity</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Jun 30, 2024, Woodward had $308.3 million in cash and cash equivalents with $562.6 million of long-term debt (less the current portion).<br /><br />For the nine months ended Jun 30, 2024, the company generated $297 million of net cash from operating activities, increasing from $156 million in the prior-year period.<br /><br />Adjusted free cash flow was $230 million compared with $103 million in the prior-year period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The increase in adjusted free cash flow was primarily due to increased earnings and improved working capital, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.&nbsp;<br /><br />During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the company returned $348 million to shareholders in the form of $43 million of dividends and $305 million of share repurchases. &nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Guidance</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has revised its fiscal 2024 guidance due to lower China on-highway deliveries and supply chain disruptions, including delayed supplier deliveries and customer pushouts. These issues are expected to delay cash collection on planned deliveries beyond the fiscal 2024 end.<br /><br />Net sales are expected to be in the $3.25-$3.3 billion band compared with the previous guidance of $3.25-$3.35 billion.&nbsp;<br /><br />Adjusted free cash flow is projected to be between $300 million and $350 million (previous projection: $325-$375 million).EPS is expected to be between $5.80 and $6.00. Earlier, EPS was forecasted in the range of $5.70-$6.00.&nbsp;<br /><br />Aerospace segment revenues are anticipated to increase in the range of 12-14%, unchanged from the previous guidance. Industrial segment revenues are expected to increase in the band of 11-13% compared with the prior guided range of 13-15%.</p></p><p><h2>How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?</h2></p><p>In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.</p><p>The consensus estimate has shifted -9.65% due to these changes.</p><p><h2>VGM Scores</h2></p><p>Currently, Woodward has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.</p><p>Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.</p><p><h2>Outlook</h2></p><p>Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Woodward has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328383/woodward-wwd-up-9-5-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-realtime_blog-2328383">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Sensata (ST) Down 0.3% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Sensata (ST). Shares have lost about 0.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.</p><p>Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Sensata due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Sensata&rsquo;s Q2 Earnings Meet Estimates</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Sensata reported second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 93 cents compared with 97 cents a year ago. The bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate.<br /><br />Quarterly revenues aggregated $1,035.5 million, down 2.5% year over year. The top line missed the consensus estimate by 0.4%.<br /><br />The company continues to make strides in its electrification business. It augmented its contactor product portfolio with the buyout of the remaining shares of its joint venture in China. Management highlighted that in the second quarter of 2024, the automotive business sector outgrew the market by more than 700 basis points.</p><h3>Segmental Results</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Performance Sensing</strong> revenues (69.9% of total revenues) increased 4.4% year over year to $723.9 million. The top line gained as both automotive and heavy vehicle and off-road businesses performed well across Europe, Japan and Korea. Segmental adjusted operating income was $177 million compared with $180.4 million in the prior-year quarter.<br /><br /><strong>Sensing Solutions</strong> revenues (25.9%) were $268.1 million, down 19% from the previous year. The considerable year-over-year decrease was due to continued destocking, a sluggish housing construction market impacting the industrial sector, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the absence of a one-time $26 million revenue boost from Dynapower business that benefited the second-quarter 2023 performance. Segmental adjusted operating income was $79.8 million compared with $94.2 million in the prior-year quarter.<br /><br /><strong>Other</strong> revenues (4.2%) were $43.5 million, up 16% from the prior-year period.</p><h3>Other Details</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Total operating income was $129.9 million compared with $118 million in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />Total operating expenses were $905.6 million, down from $944 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income was $196.7 million, declining 4.4%.<br /><br />Adjusted EBITDA totaled $231.8 million in the quarter, down from $234.7 million in the previous year&rsquo;s quarter.</p><h3>Cash Flow &amp; Liquidity</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">During the quarter, Sensata generated $143.5 million of net cash from operating activities compared with $115.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow was $98.4 million compared with $68.2 million a year ago.<br /><br />As of Jun 30, 2024, the company had $1,033 million in cash and cash equivalents and $3,170.8 million of net long-term debt compared with $460.4 million and $3,375.5 million, respectively, as of Mar 31, 2024.<br /><br />During the second quarter, Sensata returned approximately $18.1 million to shareholders through its quarterly dividend of 12 cents per share paid on May 22, 2024.</p><h3>Guidance</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Sensata provided guidance for the third quarter of 2024. For the quarter, the company projects revenues in the band of $970-$1,000 million, indicating a decline of 3-0%. Adjusted operating income is expected to be $184-$194 million, implying a year-over-year increase of 1% to a decline of 4%.<br /><br />Adjusted EPS is estimated to be 82-88 cents, suggesting a decline of 10-3%. Adjusted net income is anticipated in the $124-$134 million range, indicating a decrease of 10% to 3%.</p></p><p><h2>How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?</h2></p><p>In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.</p><p>The consensus estimate has shifted -7.97% due to these changes.</p><p><h2>VGM Scores</h2></p><p>At this time, Sensata has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.</p><p>Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.</p><p><h2>Outlook</h2></p><p>Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Sensata has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.</p><p><h2>Performance of an Industry Player</h2></p><p>Sensata belongs to the Zacks Instruments - Control industry. Another stock from the same industry, Badger Meter (BMI), has gained 1.3% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended June 2024.</p><p>Badger Meter reported revenues of $216.66 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +23.2%. EPS of $1.12 for the same period compares with $0.76 a year ago.</p><p>Badger Meter is expected to post earnings of $1 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.</p><p>Badger Meter has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Score of D.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328382/sensata-st-down-0-3-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-rebound?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-realtime_blog-2328382">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Sprouts Farmers (SFM). Shares have added about 7.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.</p><p>Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Sprouts Farmers due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Sprouts Farmers Gains as Q2 Earnings Beat &amp; Comps Impress</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. reported better-than-expected second-quarter performance and provided an upbeat outlook for 2024. Both the top and bottom lines not only increased year over year but also beat their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company&#39;s results were favorably impacted by decent comparable sales, positive traffic trends, accelerating unit growth, and increasing customer engagement.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Q2 in Details</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The renowned grocery retailer delivered quarterly earnings of 94 cents a share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents. The bottom line increased 32.4% from 71 cents reported in the year-ago period.<br /><br />Net sales came in at $1,893.5 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,828 million. The metric increased 12% on a year-over-year basis. The growth was driven by sales from the new stores and a jump in comparable store sales.<br /><br />Comparable store sales increased 6.7% during the quarter under review. We note that e-commerce sales grew 30% and represented 14% of total sales in the quarter.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Margins</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The adjusted gross profit rose 14.5% year over year to $718.4 million in the quarter, while the gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 37.9% from the prior-year quarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sprouts Farmers reported an adjusted operating income of $127.3 million, up from $99.7 million reported in the year-ago period. The adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 6.7%.&nbsp;<br /><br />SG&amp;A expenses increased 11.7% year over year to $556.4 million. As a percentage of net sales, the metric remained flat at 29.4%.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Store Update</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">During the quarter, Sprouts Farmers opened five new stores, thereby taking the total count to 419 stores in 23 states as of Jun 30, 2024. It plans to open about 35 new stores in 2024, with the majority of openings in the fourth quarter.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Other Financial Aspects</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Sprouts Farmers ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $177.3 million, long-term debt and finance lease liabilities of roughly $8.1 million and stockholders&rsquo; equity of $1,269.3 million. The company approved a fresh $600 million share repurchase plan and bought back 640 thousand shares, investing a total of $44 million during the quarter.<br /><br />Sprouts Farmers generated cash from operations of $311.3 million and spent $89 million on capital expenditures, net of landlord reimbursement, year to date through Jun 30, 2024.&nbsp;<br /><br />Management anticipates capital expenditures (net of landlord reimbursements) in the range of $225-$245 million for 2024.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Outlook</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">For the third quarter of 2024, Sprouts Farmers expects comparable store sales growth between 3.5% and 4.5% and adjusted earnings in the band of 71-75 cents a share compared with 65 cents reported in the year-ago period.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sprouts Farmers expects net sales growth of 9-10% and comparable store sales growth of 4% to 5% in 2024.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sprouts Farmers guided adjusted earnings before interest and taxes between $445 million and $455 million for 2024.&nbsp;<br /><br />While the company anticipates the gross margin to improve in the second half, in line with the first half margin expansion, it foresees pressure on SG&amp;A due to ongoing wage and benefits as well as strategic investments. Despite this, it expects full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $3.29-$3.37 per share, which implies an increase from the $2.84 reported in 2023.</p></p><p><h2>How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?</h2></p><p>It turns out, estimates revision have trended upward during the past month.</p><p>The consensus estimate has shifted 8.36% due to these changes.</p><p><h2>VGM Scores</h2></p><p>At this time, Sprouts Farmers has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F.

<![CDATA[ Why Is SBA Communications (SBAC) Up 4.9% Since Last Earnings Report? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>It has been about a month since the last earnings report for SBA Communications (SBAC). Shares have added about 4.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.</p><p>Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is SBA Communications due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. <h3>SBA Communications&#39; Q2 AFFO Beat, Revenues Fall Y/Y</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">SBA Communications reported second-quarter 2024 adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of $3.29, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a whisker. Moreover, the figure marked a rise of 1.5% from the prior-year quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Results reflected a marginal improvement in site leasing revenues. It continues to benefit from the addition of sites to its portfolio. However, lower revenues posted by site development hurt the results to some extent. The company lowered its 2024 outlook.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quarterly total revenues decreased 2.7% year over year to $660.5 million.

<![CDATA[ <p>It has been about a month since the last earnings report for McDonald's (MCD). Shares have added about 8.7% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.</p><p>Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is McDonald's due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. <h3 style="text-align: justify;">McDonald&#39;s Q2 Earnings and Revenues Lag Estimates</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">McDonald&#39;s reported second-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and bottom lines decreased on a year-over-year basis.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings &amp; Revenue Discussion</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">In second-quarter 2024, McDonald&#39;s reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.97, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.08. Moreover, adjusted earnings decreased 6% year over year.<br /><br />Quarterly net revenues of $6,490 million lagged the consensus mark of $6,651 million. The top line declined 0.1% year over year.<br /><br />At company-operated restaurants, sales were $2.46 billion, down 1% year over year. Sales at franchise-operated restaurants amounted to $3.94 billion, which increased 0.2% year over year. Other revenues rose 16% year over year to $89 million.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Comps Details</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">In the quarter under discussion, global comps declined 1% against 11.7% growth in the prior-year quarter. The company&rsquo;s comps decreased for the first time after increasing in thirteen straight quarters.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Comps Across Segments</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>United States.:</strong> In the second quarter, segmental comps dropped 0.7% against 10.3% growth of the prior year. Comparable sales were influenced by a decline in guest counts, though this was somewhat balanced by higher average checks thanks to strategic menu price increases. Effective execution at the restaurant level, along with ongoing growth in digital orders and delivery services, also contributed positively to the overall results.<br /><br /><strong>International Operated Markets: </strong>Segmental comps decreased 1.1% against 11.9% growth in the year-ago quarter. The performance of the segment was affected by declining comparable sales in several markets, with France being a significant contributor to this downturn.<br /><br /><strong>International Developmental Licensed Segment:</strong> Segmental comparable sales registered a 1.3% decline against 14% growth in the prior-year quarter. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East and declining comparable sales in China outweighed the positive sales performance in Latin America and Japan.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Operating Highlights &amp; Expenses</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">In the second quarter, McDonald&rsquo;s total operating costs and expenses were $3.57 billion, up 5% year over year.<br /><br />Operating income dropped 6% year over year to $2.92 billion. Net income totaled $2.02 billion, down 12% year over year.</p></p><p><h2>How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?</h2></p><p>In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.</p><p><h2>VGM Scores</h2></p><p>At this time, McDonald's has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.</p><p>Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.</p><p><h2>Outlook</h2></p><p>Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise McDonald's has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.</p><p><h2>Performance of an Industry Player</h2></p><p>McDonald's is part of the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry. Over the past month, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), a stock from the same industry, has gained 6.8%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended June 2024 more than a month ago.</p><p>Chipotle reported revenues of $2.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.2%. EPS of $0.34 for the same period compares with $0.25 a year ago.</p><p>For the current quarter, Chipotle is expected to post earnings of $0.24 per share, indicating a change of +4.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.</p><p>Chipotle has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions. Additionally, the stock has a VGM Score of D.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328385/mcdonald-s-mcd-up-8-7-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-continue?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-realtime_blog-2328385">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Flowserve (FLS). Shares have lost about 0.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.</p><p>Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Flowserve due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Flowserve Q2 Earnings &amp; Revenues Top Estimates, Rise Y/Y</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Flowserve&rsquo;s second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings (excluding 18 cents from non-recurring items) of 73 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. The bottom line increased 40.4% year over year. Results primarily benefited from higher revenues, partially offset by an increase in operating costs and expenses.<br /><br />Flowserve&rsquo;s total revenues of $1.16 billion beat the consensus estimate of $1.12 billion. The top line increased 7.1% year over year. Sales increased 7.7% on a constant-currency basis.<br /><br />Aftermarket sales increased 5% year over year (up 5.8% on a constant-currency basis) to $590.5 million. Original equipment sales totaled $566.4 million, reflecting an increase of 9.4% year over year (up 9.8% on a constant-currency basis).<br /><br />Total bookings amounted to $1.25 billion, reflecting an increase of 12.2% (up 13% on a constant-currency basis) year over year. The backlog at the end of the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 2.8% sequentially.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Segmental Details</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Flowserve currently has two reportable segments, Flowserve Pump Division and Flow Control Division. A brief discussion of the segments is provided below:<br /><br />Revenues from the Flowserve Pump Division segment were $812.2 million, up 6.1% year over year. Bookings increased 18.3% year over year to $898.8 million. Segmental operating income was $131 million, up 33.7% year over year.<br /><br />Revenues from the Flow Control Division segment were $347.7 million, up 9.4% year over year. Bookings of $349.2 million decreased 2.9% on a year-over-year basis. The segment&rsquo;s operating income was $32.3 million, down 10.5% year over year.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Margin Profile</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">In the second quarter, Flowserve&rsquo;s cost of sales increased 4.4% year over year to $790.8 million. Gross profit increased 13.4% year over year to $366.1 million and the margin increased 170 basis points (bps) to 31.6%. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $238.6 million, up 3.7% year over year.<br /><br />Operating income increased 25.5% year over year to $121.3 million. The adjusted operating margin was 12.5%, up 210 bps year over year. The effective tax rate was 23.8%.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Balance Sheet and Cash Flow</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Exiting the second quarter, Flowserve had cash and cash equivalents of $515.1 million compared with $545.7 million at the end of December 2023. Long-term debt (due after one year) was $1.21 billion compared with $1.17 billion at the end of December 2023.<br /><br />In the first six months of 2024, the company generated net cash of $49.5 million from operating activities compared with $50.4 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditure totaled $28.3 million, down 11.3% year over year.<br /><br />During the same period, the company used $55.3 million for distributing dividends.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">2024 Guidance</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Flowserve continues to expect a 4-6% increase in revenues from the year-ago levels. The company anticipates earnings per share (on a reported basis) to be between $2.25 and $2.45. Adjusted earnings per share are now estimated in the $2.60&ndash;$2.75 band, higher than the earlier guidance of $2.50-$2.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings is pegged at $2.68 per share.<br /><br />The adjusted tax rate is projected to be approximately 21%. The company forecasts net interest expense and capital expenditure to be in the range of $60-$65 million and $75-$85 million, respectively.</p></p><p><h2>How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?</h2></p><p>In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.</p><p><h2>VGM Scores</h2></p><p>Currently, Flowserve has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.</p><p>Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.</p><p><h2>Outlook</h2></p><p>Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions has been net zero. Notably, Flowserve has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.</p><p><h2>Performance of an Industry Player</h2></p><p>Flowserve is part of the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry. Over the past month, Barnes Group (B), a stock from the same industry, has gained 0.4%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended June 2024 more than a month ago.</p><p>Barnes Group reported revenues of $382.23 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.8%. EPS of $0.37 for the same period compares with $0.58 a year ago.</p><p>Barnes Group is expected to post earnings of $0.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +105.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.3%.</p><p>The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Barnes Group. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of F.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328389/flowserve-fls-down-0-2-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-rebound?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-realtime_blog-2328389">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>A month has gone by since the last earnings report for F5 Networks (FFIV). Shares have lost about 0.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.</p><p>Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is F5 due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. <h3>F5 Q3 Earnings and Revenues Surpass Expectations</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">F5 reported better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2024 results. This Seattle, WA-based company&rsquo;s non-GAAP earnings of $3.36 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97 and increased 4.7% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s $3.21.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The bottom line also surpassed management&rsquo;s guidance range of $2.89-$3.01 per share. The robust bottom-line performance reflected the combined impact of gross margin improvement and disciplined operating expense management.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">F5&rsquo;s revenues of $695 million for the fiscal third quarter surpassed the consensus mark of $686.6 million but declined 1.1% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues came at the higher end of the company&rsquo;s guidance range of $675-$695 million.</p><h3>Top Line in Detail</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Product revenues (44.4% of total revenues), which comprise the Software and Systems sub-divisions, decreased 6% year over year to $308.5 million. The decline in Product revenues was mainly due to lower Systems sales, partially offset by increased Software sales. The company&rsquo;s reported non-GAAP Product revenues were higher than our estimate of $304.5 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Systems revenues plunged 16% year over year to $130 million, accounting for approximately 42% of the total Product revenues. The company revealed that the decline reflected a lower level of backlog-related shipments compared with prior quarters, while the demand showed some signs of stabilization. Our estimate for Systems revenues was pegged at $137 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The negative impacts of lower Systems sales were partially offset by the improved performance of Software. Software revenues increased 3% year over year to $179 million in the fiscal third quarter. Software revenues grew on the back of renewals. Our estimate was pegged at $167.5 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Global Service revenues (55.6% of the total revenues) grew 3.4% to $387 million. The robust growth was mainly driven by price increases introduced in fiscal 2022. Our estimate for Global Services revenues was pegged at $381.2 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">F5 registered lower sales across the Americas and APAC regions, witnessing a year-over-year decrease of 4% and 1%, respectively. However, revenues from the EMEA region grew 5% on a year-over-year basis. Revenue contributions from the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions were 55%, 27% and 18%, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Customer-wise, Enterprises, Service providers and Government represented 67%, 12% and 21% of product bookings, respectively.</p><h3>Margins</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">On a year-over-year basis, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins expanded 60 basis points each to 80.4% and 83.1%, respectively. The improvement was driven by price realization and ease in supply-chain constraints, as well as reductions in ancillary supply-chain costs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s fiscal third-quarter GAAP operating expenses declined 13.4% to $396 million, while non-GAAP operating expenses marginally declined from $346 million registered in the year-ago quarter to $345.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">F5&rsquo;s GAAP operating profit jumped 56.7% to $163 million, while the margin expanded 870 bps to 23.4%. However, the non-GAAP operating profit remained flat year over year at $233 million, while the margin improved 20 bps to 33.4%. An increase in the non-GAAP operating margin was primarily driven by an improvement in the gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.</p><h3>Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">F5 exited the June-ended quarter with cash and short-term investments of $935.6 million compared with the previous quarter&rsquo;s $903.4 million. The company generated an operating cash flow of $546 million in the fiscal third quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">During the fiscal third quarter, FFIV repurchased shares worth $150 million. The company is committed to using at least 50% of free cash flow for share repurchases.</p><h3>Guidance</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">F5 projects non-GAAP revenues in the $720-$740 million band (midpoint of $730 million) and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $3.38-$3.50 (midpoint of $3.44) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 83%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company expects non-GAAP operating expenses between $350 million and $362 million for the fiscal fourth quarter. Share-based compensation expenses are anticipated in the range of $54-$56 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For fiscal 2024, F5 now expects its revenue growth to be mid to high single-digit percentage.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reiterated the non-GAAP EPS growth in the range of 7-9%. F5 now projects the effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 to be 19.5-20% from the 20-22% projected previously.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, FFIV still intends to return at least 50% of its fiscal 2024 free cash flow to shareholders through share buybacks.</p></p><p><h2>How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?</h2></p><p>In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.</p><p>The consensus estimate has shifted 6.12% due to these changes.</p><p><h2>VGM Scores</h2></p><p>At this time, F5 has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.</p><p>Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.</p><p><h2>Outlook</h2></p><p>Estimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, F5 has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328388/f5-ffiv-down-0-5-since-last-earnings-report-can-it-rebound?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-realtime_blog-2328388">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>It has been about a month since the last earnings report for CNO Financial (CNO). Shares have lost about 1.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.</p><p>Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CNO due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CNO Financial Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates, &#39;24 EPS View Up</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">CNO Financial Group reported second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.05, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 45.8%. Moreover, the bottom line rose 94.4% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues increased 4.2% year over year to $1.07 billion in the second quarter. The top line beat the consensus mark by 16.4%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The strong second-quarter results benefited from improved insurance product margin, premiums, and general account assets.&nbsp;However, the decline of the policyholder and other special-purpose portfolios partially offset the results.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Second-Quarter Performance</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Total insurance policy income of $641.5 million improved 2.1% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.2% due to a rise in annuity, health and life insurance policy incomes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CNO&rsquo;s net investment income increased 2.4% year over year to $409.1 million in the second quarter. General account assets grew 8.3% year over year to $351.7 million and beat the consensus mark by 14.1%.

Annuity, Health and Life products accounted for 27.7%, 49.4% and 22.9%, respectively, of CNO&rsquo;s insurance margin.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total benefits and expenses were $915.6 million, which declined 1.2% year over year. The decline in the metric was due to liability for future policy benefits remeasurement gain and a decline in other operating costs and expenses.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Financial Update (as of Jun 30, 2024)</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">CNO Financial exited the second quarter with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $878.8 million, which increased from the 2023-end level of $774.5 million. Total assets of $36.3 billion increased from $35.1 billion at 2023-end.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The debt-to-capital ratio was 43% at the end of the second quarter.

Adjusted operating return on equity came in at 11.2%, which improved from 8% a year ago.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Share Repurchase and Dividend Update</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">CNO Financial rewarded its shareholders with $60 million in the form of share buybacks and dividends of $17.2 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Jun 30, 2024, the company had remaining repurchase funds of $421.8 million.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">2024 Guidance</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">New Update</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">CNO Financial now expects 2024 EPS in the range of $3.30-$3.50, indicating an increase of 10% from the 2023 figure of $3.09. The company expects the expense ratio to be in the range of 19%-19.2% for 2024, improving from the 2023 level of 19.4%. It expects $200-$250 million excess cash flow to the holding company.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Previous View</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The company continues to anticipate the effective tax rate for 2024 to be around 23%. It is also aiming at a leverage of 25 for this year.</p></p><p><h2>How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?</h2></p><p>It turns out, estimates revision have trended upward during the past month.</p><p><h2>VGM Scores</h2></p><p>Currently, CNO has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.</p><p>Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.</p><p><h2>Outlook</h2></p><p>Estimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise CNO has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.</p><p><h2>Performance of an Industry Player</h2></p><p>CNO is part of the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry.

<![CDATA[ Why Is CNA Financial (CNA) Up 3.3% Since Last Earnings Report? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 15:30:14 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>A month has gone by since the last earnings report for CNA Financial (CNA). Shares have added about 3.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.</p><p>Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CNA Financial due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CNA Financial Q2 Earnings Miss, Revenues Rise Y/Y</strong><br /><br />CNA Financial Corporation reported second-quarter 2024 core earnings of $1.19 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%. However, the bottom line increased 5.3% year over year. The quarterly results of CNA reflected higher income from fixed income securities, larger invested asset base, improved retention and renewal premium change, partly offset by poor underwriting income and escalating expenses.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Behind Second-Quarter Headlines</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Total operating revenues of CNA Financial were $3.1 billion, up 6.7% year over year due to higher premiums, net investment income and other revenues. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3%. Net written premiums of Property &amp; Casualty Operations increased 6% year over year to $2.6 billion, driven by retention of 85% and renewal premium change of 5% with a written rate of 4%.<br /><br />Net investment income rose 7.4% year over year to $618 million. The increase was driven by higher income from fixed income securities as a result of favorable reinvestment rates and a larger invested asset base, as well as favorable limited partnership and common stock returns. Our estimate for net investment was $601.1 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $592.3 million.<br /><br />Total claims, benefits and expenses increased 7.3% to $2.6 billion, primarily due to higher insurance claims and policyholders&#39; benefits, amortization of deferred acquisition costs, non-insurance warranty expense, other insurance related expenses and other expenses. Our estimate was $2.5 billion.<br /><br />Catastrophe losses were $82 million, wider than a loss of $68 million in the year-ago quarter. Underwriting income declined 10.1% year over year to $124 million. Our estimate was $175.3 million. The combined ratio deteriorated 100 basis points (bps) year over year to 94.8. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 93.6 while our estimate was 92.8.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Segment Results</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Specialty&rsquo;s net written premiums increased 4% year over year to $857 million. Our estimate was $900 million. The combined ratio deteriorated 180 bps to 92.7. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 85.1.<br /><br />Commercial&rsquo;s net written premiums increased 10% year over year to $1.4 billion. Our estimate was $1.3 billion. The combined ratio deteriorated 70 bps to 97. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 94.8.<br /><br />International&rsquo;s net written premiums remained flat year over year at $359 million. Our estimate was $402.7 million. The combined ratio improved 30 bps to 91.9. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 106.9.<br /><br />Life &amp; Group&rsquo;s net earned premiums were $109 million, down 3.5% year over year. Our estimate was $105.9 million. The core loss was $1 million, narrower than a loss of $20 million incurred in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a reduced impact from long-term care policy buyouts and higher net investment income.<br /><br />Corporate &amp; Other&rsquo;s core loss of $53 million was wider than a loss of $46 million incurred in the year-earlier quarter.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Financial Update</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The core return on equity expanded 40 bps to 10.6%. Book value, excluding AOCI, as of Jun 30 was $45.86 per share, down 1.1% from the 2023-end level. Statutory capital and surplus for the Combined Continental Casualty Companies increased 0.7% from the 2023-end level to $11 billion at quarter end. Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased 23% to $616 million in the quarter.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Dividend Update</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">CNA Financial&rsquo;s board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 44 cents per share to be paid out on Aug 29 to shareholders as of Aug 12.</p></p><p><h2>How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?</h2></p><p>In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.</p><p>The consensus estimate has shifted -6.02% due to these changes.</p><p><h2>VGM Scores</h2></p><p>At this time, CNA Financial has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.</p><p>Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.</p><p><h2>Outlook</h2></p><p>Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, CNA Financial has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.</p><p><h2>Performance of an Industry Player</h2></p><p>CNA Financial belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry. Another stock from the same industry, Kinsale Capital Group, Inc. (KNSL), has gained 5.6% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended June 2024.</p><p>Kinsale Capital Group reported revenues of $384.55 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +30%. EPS of $3.75 for the same period compares with $2.88 a year ago.</p><p>For the current quarter, Kinsale Capital Group is expected to post earnings of $3.73 per share, indicating a change of +12.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days.</p><p>The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Kinsale Capital Group. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of C.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328390/why-is-cna-financial-cna-up-3-3-since-last-earnings-report?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-realtime_blog-2328390">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Campbell Soup Company </strong>CPB has been strategically concentrating on bolstering its Snacks division, which has demonstrated strong resilience despite various challenges. As part of its efforts to enhance this focus, CPB has offloaded its Pop Secret popcorn business to Our Home, a company specializing in healthier snack options.<br /><br />Recording net sales of roughly $120 million in fiscal 2024, the Pop Secret business divestiture is anticipated to be dilutive to Campbell Soup&rsquo;s earnings per share (EPS) by nearly 4 cents in fiscal 2025.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Pop Secret&rsquo;s Sale to Fuel CPB&rsquo;s Snacks Unit</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">This divestiture will allow Campbell to further prioritize its Snacks segment, which contributed 46.3% of the company&#39;s sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Over the past three years, the Snacks category has shown remarkable resilience, with minimal price sensitivity. Despite a recent slowdown driven by ongoing economic pressures on lower and middle-income consumers, the division still enjoys average consumption growth of 8%, outpacing both overall food and historical snack growth averages.<br /><br />This slight deceleration is modest compared to other edible categories, underscoring the sustained consumer demand for snacks. Though sales in the segment decreased year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 due to declines in lower-margin partner brands, contract manufacturing and fresh bakery, the company continued to see strength in its power brands, such as Goldfish and Late July.&nbsp;<br /><br />With power brands now representing two-thirds of the company&rsquo;s Snacks business, they provide a strong foundation for sustained growth. Campbell is on track to outline a clear strategy for accelerating growth in its power brands and optimizing the remaining parts of its existing Snacks portfolio. Despite the current challenges, the division&#39;s resilience and long-term growth potential make it a vital component of Campbell Soup&#39;s overall portfolio.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strategic Moves Propel Campbell Soup Forward</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Prudent acquisitions and divestitures have been instrumental to Campbell&rsquo;s success story. The company acquired Sovos Brands in March 2024 and is reaping impressive gains from its addition. Sovos Brands&#39; portfolio includes a diverse range of products, including pasta sauces, dry pasta, soups, frozen entrees, frozen pizza and yogurts, which are marketed under the brand names Rao&rsquo;s, Michael Angelo&rsquo;s and noosa.&nbsp;<br /><br />Campbell Soup&rsquo;s reported sales witnessed a 6% rise in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, attributed to the partial quarter sales from Sovos Brands. Specifically, Sovos Brands added 7 percentage points to the reported net sales growth, surpassing initial expectations. The performance of Sovos Brands, particularly Rao&#39;s, has been outstanding, with sales growing faster than expected, contributing positively to adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Management remains confident about the long-term sales growth of Sovos Brands, expecting it to be in the mid-single-digit range.&nbsp;<br /><br />Campbell Soup anticipates gaining momentum in the fourth quarter, marked by steady year-over-year volume growth, double-digit increases in both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS and sustained progress in integrating Sovos Brands.<br /><br />Driven by these upsides, shares of CPB have rallied 14.8% in the past three months compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 3.9%. The company&rsquo;s growth endeavors have also helped it surpass the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s respective growth of 3.9% and 6.2% in the same time frame.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/38/75729.jpg?v=316125535" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Is CPB Stock Free of Challenges?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Like other food companies such as <strong>General Mills </strong>GIS,<strong> Conagra Brand</strong>s CAG and <strong>Flowers Foods </strong>FLO, Campbell Soup remains affected by a dynamic macroeconomic scenario. The company is witnessing volatile consumer behaviors, especially among lower-income segments. The persistence of these headwinds could be a concern. CPB expects organic net sales growth to be nearly flat to down 1% in fiscal 2024.&nbsp; In its third-quarter earnings release, management stated that it was then tracking toward the midpoint of this updated organic sales growth view, indicating the consumer recovery pace.&nbsp;<br /><br />Campbell Soup has also been witnessing cost inflation for a while. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company witnessed core inflation in the low single digits and expects it to remain within this range for the remainder of fiscal 2024. Campbell Soup remains focused on managing areas of its portfolio affected by the rising cost of inputs, including tomatoes, olive oil and cocoa, as well as ongoing inflation in labor and warehousing expenses. However, the company&rsquo;s productivity initiatives and cost-savings programs are likely to effectively balance the impact of inflation in the fourth quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How Should CPB&rsquo;s Investors Play?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Campbell Soup&rsquo;s strategic focus on its Snacks division and the divestiture of non-core assets like Pop Secret demonstrates its commitment to optimizing its portfolio for long-term growth. The resilience of its power brands and the successful integration of Sovos Brands are positive indicators of future performance. However, ongoing challenges, such as volatile consumer behavior and cost inflation, cannot be ignored. Potential investors should weigh these near-term hurdles carefully, but current stakeholders may find it prudent to maintain their positions in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, given its overall prospects.<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328365/is-cpb-stock-a-buy-sell-or-hold-post-pop-secret-s-divestiture?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_corporate_actions-2328365">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Is Arbor Realty Stock Worth a Watch for its 12.6% Dividend Yield? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 15:19:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The mREIT industry is witnessing a favorable trend with the recent decline in mortgage rates, a positive development for the housing market. Income-seeking investors have a large appetite for REIT stocks, as U.S. law requires REITs to distribute 90% of its annual taxable income in the form of dividends.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, keeping an eye on mREIT stocks like <strong>Arbor Realty Trust, Inc</strong>. ABR, which offers ultra-high dividend yield and high payout, will be wise now. Considering yesterday&rsquo;s closing price of $13.61, ABR&rsquo;s dividend yield currently stands at 12.6%.<br /><br />This New York-headquartered REIT primarily focuses on originating and servicing loans for multi-family, single-family and other commercial real estate assets. Arbor manages a multibillion-dollar servicing portfolio specializing in government-sponsored enterprise products. Loans held for sale were $342.9 million, with financing associated with these loans totaling $335.2 million as of June 30, 2024.<br /><br />Over the past five years, Arbor Realty has raised its dividend 13 times, with an annualized dividend growth rate of 9.9%. This is impressive compared with the industry&rsquo;s average of 11.6% and attractive for investors as it represents a steady income stream.&nbsp;<br /><br />Other mREIT companies like <strong>NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc</strong>. NREF and <strong>AFC Gamma, Inc</strong>. AFCG are also providing investors with solid dividend options. NREF has an annual dividend yield of 10.4%, while AFCG has a dividend yield of 6.8%.<br />&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Arbor Realty Trust Dividend Yield (TTM)</h3> <img alt="Arbor Realty Trust Dividend Yield (TTM)" height="251" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/19/1724856421.png" title="" width="537" /> <p>Arbor Realty Trust dividend-yield-ttm | Arbor Realty Trust Quote</p></div><p>Should one keep an eye on ABR stock to earn a high dividend yield? Let&rsquo;s check the company&#39;s financials to understand the risks and rewards before making any decision.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Arbor Realty: Capital Distribution &amp; Liquidity Position</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from regular quarterly dividend payouts, ABR has a share buyback program in place. In December 2023, the company&rsquo;s board authorized a repurchase of $100 million worth of shares, increasing the total to $150 million. This followed an earlier $50 million repurchase announced in March 2023. As of June 30, 2023, almost $138.6 million shares remained available. The plan has no expiry date.<br /><br />In terms of liquidity position, as of June 30, 2024, ABR&#39;s cash and cash equivalents were $956 million. The company&rsquo;s due to borrowers totaled $758 million as of the same date.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s capital position remains strong. Arbor Realty plans to return the excess capital to its shareholders prudently.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Does Arbor Realty&rsquo;s Long-Term View Look Favorable?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Long-term bond yields have declined with the Fed&#39;s announcement of an interest rate cut starting in September. This resulted in a decline in mortgage rates. The average rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.46% as of Aug. 22 from 6.49% a week ago. A year ago, the metric averaged 7.23%.<br /><br />Housing affordability challenges are expected to decline with lower mortgage rates. With rates trending lower and balanced supply/affordability playing out in the mortgage market, demand is set to increase in the coming days. This is likely to support the ABR&rsquo;s financials further.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, rate cuts beginning in September will likely increase net interest spreads. This will ease earnings pressure for ABR, as it is currently reeling under high funding costs. This will help the company to increase its dividend payout, which might look attractive to investors.<br /><br />The company has been witnessing steady organic growth over the past few years. ABR&rsquo;s total revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.5% over the past three years ending 2023. Further, its net interest income witnessed a CAGR of 36% in the same period.<br />&nbsp;<br />Given the strong fundamentals, the company will be able to sustain its position in the current rapidly changing market.<br /><br />In the past six months, shares of Arbor Realty have gained 1.6% against the industry&rsquo;s decline of 1.2%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8a/75787.jpg?v=1115024654" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite several near-term headwinds, including increasing credit risk and a rise in non-performing loans, ABR is well-poised to counter the challenges and maintain profitability in the long term. The company offers a lucrative income option with a consistent dividend payout history.&nbsp;<br /><br />Therefore, income-seeking investors should keep this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock on their radar as it will help generate robust returns over time.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Zebra Technologies Corporation</strong> ZBRA has been witnessing growth across the Enterprise Visibility &amp; Mobility segment. Higher sales of mobile computing products are aiding the segment&rsquo;s revenues, which increased 8.6% year over year in the second quarter of 2024.<br /><br />The company has also been advancing digital capabilities, optimizing the supply chain, expanding its data analytics capability and focusing on marketing activities to better engage with customers. Driven by these initiatives and a modest demand environment, it expects 2024 net sales to increase in the band of 4-7% year over year.<br /><br />The company intends to strengthen and expand its businesses through acquisitions. ZBRA&rsquo;s acquisition of Matrox Imaging (June 2022) enabled it to combine its fixed industrial scanning and machine vision portfolio with the latter&rsquo;s expertise in the imaging market. The buyout of antuit.ai (October 2021) complemented the planning and demand forecasting module for its retail software portfolio. Also, the Fetch Robotics buyout (August 2021) boosted its capability to offer a comprehensive line of advanced robotics solutions to customers.<br /><br />Zebra remains focused on cost-management actions. In the second quarter, its gross margin increased 50 basis points to 48.4%, supported by lower freight costs. Recently, the company substantially completed the actions under its 2022 productivity plan and employee voluntary retirement plan.<br /><br />These actions impacted more than 9% of its global employee base, which is likely to generate annualized net cost savings of about $120 million. These efforts are likely to boost margins and produce more fuel to invest in organic growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ZBRA Stock&rsquo;s Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ee/75703.jpg?v=140421270" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 26.5% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 21.2% growth.<br /><br />However, the company has been bearing the brunt of weak demand for printing solutions and RFID products. This has been affecting the performance of its Asset Intelligence &amp; Tracking segment, whose sales declined 13.5% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis.<br /><br />Also, high debt levels remain a major concern. Exiting the second quarter, the company&rsquo;s long-term debt totaled $2.08 billion. Considering ZBRA&rsquo;s high debt level, its cash and cash equivalents of $411 million do not look impressive.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector are discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Flowserve Corporation</strong> FLS presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 18.2%, on average. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FLS&rsquo; 2024 earnings has increased 3.8% in the past 60 days.<br /><br /><strong>Crane Company</strong> CR presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 11.2%.<br /><br />In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CR&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has increased 2%.<br /><br /><strong>Ferguson Enterprises Inc.</strong> FERG currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. FERG delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 2.6%.<br /><br />In the past 60 days, the consensus estimate for Ferguson&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings has remained steady.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328358/here-s-why-you-should-hold-zebra-stock-in-your-portfolio-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|zer_report_update-2328358">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ NII & Loan Balance Aid Regions Financial's Growth Amid High Costs ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Regions Financial Corporation</strong> RF is well-positioned for top-line growth, driven by decent loan balances. The company&rsquo;s strong liquid profile will continue to support its capital distribution activities. However, pressure on mortgage income due to high rates and elevated expenses remain near-term concerns.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Region Financial&rsquo;s Drivers of Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has witnessed a steady growth in its loan balances, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.4% over the past five years (2018-2023). The company&#39;s strong presence in strategic markets across the Southeastern and Midwest United States positions it to capitalize on favorable economic and business trends in the regions, which will likely drive loan growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, RF&rsquo;s net interest income (NII) has witnessed steady growth driven by the company&rsquo;s decent loan demand. NII witnessed a CAGR of 7.3% over the past five years, ending 2023, with the uptrend continuing in the first half of 2024. Improvement in loan balances, combined with the Federal Reserve&#39;s announcement of a rate cut in September 2024, will likely stabilize funding costs and drive NII growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Regions Financial has a solid balance sheet and liquidity position. As of Jun 30, 2024, its total debt (long-term and short-term borrowings) was $5.6 billion, whereas the liquidity sources aggregated $56.7 billion. Given a strong liquidity profile, Regions Financial is less likely to default on interest and debt repayments if the economic situation worsens.<br /><br />Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 22.2% compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 10.6%. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/36/75736.jpg?v=404126588" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">We remain encouraged by Regions Financial&rsquo;s efforts to enhance shareholder value through its capital-deployment activities. In July 2024, the bank announced a 4% increase in its quarterly common stock dividend to 25 cents per share. The company currently has an annualized dividend growth rate of 11.48%.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the same month, <strong>The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc</strong>. GS and <strong>The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc</strong>. PNC also increased their quarterly dividend by 9.1% and 3.2%, respectively. GS and PNC&#39;s current annualized dividend growth rates stand at 24.42% and 8.84%, respectively.<br /><br />In April 2022, Regions Financial&rsquo;s board of directors announced a share repurchase program of up to $2.5 billion of common stock from the second quarter of 2022 through the fourth quarter of 2024. In the first half of 2024, the company repurchased $189 million worth of shares under this program. As of June 30, 2024, $2.05 billion shares remained available under the authorization. Given the company&rsquo;s robust liquidity, its capital deployment activities seem sustainable and will drive investors&rsquo; confidence in the stock.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Escalating Costs and Low Mortgage Volume to Hurt RF</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Regions Financial continues to record an increase in expenses. Non-interest expenses witnessed a CAGR of 4.3% over the 2018-2023 period. In the first six months of 2024, the expense level remained flat year over year. The rise was majorly due to increases in salaries, and employee benefit expenses and other expenses. Although the company is implementing expense management actions, its ongoing investment in technology advancement and franchise strengthening will keep costs high in the near term.<br /><br />Regions Financial&rsquo;s mortgage income, which is a key component of its non-interest income, witnessed a negative CAGR of 4.5% over the 2018-2023 period, with the downward trend persisting in the first half of 2024. Although mortgage rates are declining, they remain high considerably. Coupled with home price appreciation and limited supply, mortgage origination volume remains subdued. While the current decline in mortgage rates is likely to support the growth in the long run, it will take some time before this positively impacts the company&#39;s mortgage banking business performance in the near term.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328449/nii-loan-balance-aid-regions-financial-s-growth-amid-high-costs?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|zer_report_update-2328449">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Markets Await NVIDIA Earnings ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 15:07:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Pre-market futures are down gently this Hump Day, now squarely in the shadow of <strong>NVIDIA&rsquo;s</strong> NVDA Q2 earnings report after today&rsquo;s close. We may tend to think market participants are spending an inordinate amount of time on one stock, but if there had to be one in the year 2024, this would be it.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Expectations for NVIDIA&rsquo;s Q2 Earnings</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">There are only a few companies on the planet with a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, and none of these have gained nearly 3000% in share price over the past five years. NVIDIA has always been known as an innovator: it created the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), or what you may think of as a video microchip. And they are now ubiquitous.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past year and a half or so, the big trade has been in Artificial Intelligence (AI), and here NVIDIA has been a market leader, as well. Data Center development is key in the AI space, and this is where NVIDIA has gotten well ahead of most of its competition.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, Growth at the company has earned an A from the Zacks Style metric, and Momentum gets an A, as well. However, Value for NVIDIA shares currently has an F. Yet the company expects +137% earnings per share growth in Q2 reported this afternoon, and +110% in quarterly revenues. The company currently rides a six-quarter positive earnings surprise streak, with a trailing four-quarter average beat of +18%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Kohl&rsquo;s Shares Up on Q2 Beat</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">This morning, department store operator <strong>Kohl&rsquo;s</strong> KSS outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines in its Q2 report this morning. Earnings of 59 cents per share outpaces the 46 cents anticipated (and better than the 52 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter) on $3.73 billion in sales, +1.85% above the Zacks consensus.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It also represents a nice bounceback from the -700% earnings per share miss in Kohl&rsquo;s prior quarter. Yet year-over-year comps were down -5% in Q2, even with its Sephora component performing well in Kohl&rsquo;s stores. But raised guidance has helped bumped shares up +4% in today&rsquo;s pre-market; it had been trading down -30% year to date.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Another Big Beat and Raise for Abercrombie in Q2</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</strong> ANF more than doubled its earnings year over year &mdash; coming in at $2.50 cents per share, well above the $2.14 in the Zacks consensus. Revenues of $1.13 billion easily surpassed the $1.09 billion, representing +21% growth from one year ago. And guidance has been raised at the Ohio-based retaler.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Yet shares are trading the news down -10% in today&rsquo;s pre-market, on an &ldquo;increasingly uncertain environment&rdquo; for the Abercrombie brands, which include Hollister and Gilly Hicks. Also, the stock, after posting an average 210% earnings beat in its trailing four quarters, had been bid up nearly +90% year to date. So consider this sell-off a booking of profits.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Smucker&rsquo;s Shares Down Following Mixed Fiscal Q1</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">America&rsquo;s pantry stocker, <strong>J.M. Smucker Co.</strong> SJM, posted a nearly +12% earnings per share surprise this morning in its fiscal Q1 report: $2.44 per share versus $2.18 in the Zacks consensus (and better than the $2.21 per share posted in the year-ago quarter). Revenues were slightly below estimates, however, with its $2.13 billion missing expectations by -0.42%. Thus, the shares are down another -3.5% in early trading, adding to the -4.5% the stock has brought in year to date.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328352/markets-await-nvidia-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-economic_highlights-2328352">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tetra Tech Inc. </strong>TTEK is benefiting from its focus on providing high-end consulting, design and engineering services. Handsome rewards to shareholders add to the stock&rsquo;s appeal.<br /><br />Headquartered in Pasadena, Tetra Tech is a leading provider of consulting, construction management, engineering, program management and technical services. It serves clients by providing cost-effective and innovative solutions for dealing with the fundamental needs for water, environmental and alternative energy services.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s delve into the factors that make this company a smart investment choice at the moment.<br /><br /><strong>Business Strength:</strong> In the quarters ahead, Tetra Tech is poised to gain from its diversified business structure, which helps mitigate the adverse impact of weakness in one end market with strength across the others. Also, the company&rsquo;s focus on providing high-end consulting, design and engineering services is constantly enhancing its competitive edge. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, its revenues increased 11% year over year, driven by increased activity in the U.S. Federal, U.S. State &amp; Local, U.S. Commercial and International client sectors.<br /><br /><strong>Segmental Strength:</strong> Tetra Tech&rsquo;s Government Services Group (GSG) segment is benefiting from higher environmental and advanced water treatment work. Net sales from the segment increased 25% year over year in the fiscal third quarter (ended June 2024). Increased activity on sustainable infrastructure and Renewable Energy programs is aiding the Commercial/International Services Group segment. The RPS acquisition is also aiding the segment. Revenues from the segment increased 4% year over year in the fiscal third quarter.<br /><br />Tetra Tech currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). In the past three months, the stock has gained 10.9% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 7.8% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d1/75717.jpg?v=963667869" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Expansion Efforts:</strong> TTEK is focused on strengthening its competency through acquisitions. In May 2024, it acquired Convergence Controls &amp; Engineering, a systems integration and engineering services company. This acquisition will enable the company to offer a comprehensive line of integrated automation platform solutions to its clients across the water and energy sectors. Convergence will be part of its GSG segment. Tetra Tech acquired engineering and consulting firm LS Technologies in February 2024. The acquisition of LS Technologies will add significant additional capabilities and clients to its federal IT practice within its GSG segment.<br /><br />Tetra Tech completed the acquisition of RPS Group plc, an established technology-enabled consultancy firm, in January 2023. The acquisition enhanced its consultancy in water, environment and sustainable infrastructure, thereby expanding its water practice in the United Kingdom and strengthening its foothold in renewable energy and environmental management.&nbsp;<br /><br />TTEK also acquired Reston, VA-based enterprise technology services, cybersecurity and management consulting firm Amyx, Inc. in January 2023. As part of the Federal Information Technology division, the Amyx acquisition expanded its use of advanced data analytics, cybersecurity, digital transformation and agile software development solutions for its government and commercial customers. Amyx is integrated into the GSG segment.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other top-ranked companies from the same space are discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Flowserve Corporation</strong> FLS currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />FLS delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 18.2%.

<![CDATA[ ETF Winners of Q2 Earnings: 4 Must-See Charts ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Wall Street has been on a tumultuous ride over the past month. While recession fears keep investors on edge, bets over Fed rate cuts in September fuel optimism in the stock market. Additionally, the second-quarter earnings season produced an overall stable picture of corporate profitability but concerns have emerged about the outlook, as estimates for the current period have weakened more than the last two periods.<br /><br />Total second-quarter earnings for 473 S&amp;P 500 members, or 94.6% of the index&rsquo;s total membership are up 8.0% from the same period last year on 5.0% higher revenues, with 79.7% beating EPS estimates and 59.8% beating revenue estimates. Except for the revenue beat percentage, which at 59.8% is near the lowest for this group of 473 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period, all the other performance metrics are tracking better relative to the recent periods. &nbsp;<br /><br />Given this, most equity ETFs have impressed with their performance and generated handsome returns over the trailing one-month period. Below are four ETFs from different sectors that have gained from strong earnings despite the market volatility. We have provided a chart for their performances over the past month and compared them with the broader market fund (SPY) and the broader sector.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (</strong>IHI<strong>)</strong><br /><br />iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF, which provides exposure to U.S. companies that manufacture and distribute medical devices, has gained 6.7% over the past month. Total earnings for the healthcare sector&rsquo;s total market capitalization are up 19.1% on 8.3% higher revenues, with 86% of the companies beating on earnings and 75.4% exceeding the top-line estimates. Notably, the sector is the largest contributor to the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s earnings growth (read: Pharma ETFs in Focus Post Solid Q2 Earnings).&nbsp;<br /><br />Further, the ETF got some boost from the sector&rsquo;s non-cyclical nature, providing a cushion to the portfolio amid volatile market conditions. IHI has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/69/75769.jpg?v=1844337761" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong>First Trust S-Network E-Commerce ETF (</strong>ISHP<strong>)</strong><br /><br />First Trust S-Network E-Commerce ETF has risen 5.7% over the past month. It offers exposure to 61 companies operating in the following business segments &mdash; Content Navigation, Online Retail, Online Marketplace and E-Commerce Infrastructure. ISHP falls in the retail category. The retail sector is the second largest contributor to the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s earnings growth. Total Q2 earnings from the sector are up 17.3% year over year on 4.8% higher revenues.<br /><br />First Trust S-Network E-Commerce ETF has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/0e/75768.jpg?v=1797466185" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong>iShares U.S. Insurance ETF (</strong>IAK<strong>)</strong><br /><br />iShares U.S. Insurance ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that provide life, property and casualty and full-line insurance. It has gained 5.4% in a month and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook.<br /><br />Earnings of the financial sector are up 10.5% from the same period last year on 5.8% higher revenues, with 88.8% of the companies topping EPS and 66.3% exceeding revenue estimates. Notably, the earnings beat ratio is the second highest this earnings season. Life insurance companies came up with a 100% earnings beat, followed by an 80% beat each for property and casualty and accident and health insurers.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/e5/75767.jpg?v=931722183" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong>Invesco DWA Technology Momentum ETF (</strong>PTF<strong>)&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />The technology sector saw a huge sell-off on fading AI enthusiasm amid the disappointing results from four of the &ldquo;Magnificent 7&rdquo; &mdash; Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). Still, PTF gained 7.4% as it does not have large exposure to these stocks and focuses on tech companies that show relative strength (momentum). Invesco DWA Technology Momentum ETF has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (read: 5 Sector ETFs Scaling New Highs on Fed Minutes).<br /><br />Total earnings for the technology sector are up 15.5% from the same period last year on 7.5% higher revenues, with 84.1% beating EPS estimates and 72.5% beating revenue estimates. While the earnings and revenue beat percentages are tracking below historical averages, growth rates are comparable to the preceding period. &nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b2/75766.jpg?v=1925840925" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328362/etf-winners-of-q2-earnings-4-must-see-charts?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2328362">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ The J.M. Smucker Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, SJM Stock Down on View Cut ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:59:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The J. M. Smucker Company </strong>SJM posted first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year, and earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the company lowered its guidance for fiscal 2025 due to the dynamic consumer landscape and a rise in green coffee costs. Shares of SJM have dipped more than 4% in the pre-market trading session following the release.<br /><br />On the brighter side, J. M. Smucker&rsquo;s ability to achieve net sales and earnings growth despite a tough consumer environment is noteworthy. Management attributed this to the company&rsquo;s strategic focus, progress in delivering core business objectives, successful integration of Hostess Brands, and commitment to transformation, cost discipline and cash generation.&nbsp;<br /><br />SJM&rsquo;s first-quarter results reflect the impact of several key transactions, including the divestiture of the Canada condiment business (Jan. 2, 2024), the acquisition of Hostess Brands (Nov. 7, 2023) and the divestiture of the Sahale Snacks business (Nov. 1, 2023).</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">SJM&rsquo;s Quarterly Performance: Key Metrics and Insights</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Adjusted earnings of $2.44 per share advanced 10% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The J. M. Smucker Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise<br /><br /><img alt="The J. M. Smucker Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/bc/1724853129.png" title="" width="589" /> </h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The J. M. Smucker Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The J. M. Smucker Company Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Net sales amounted to $2,125.1 million, which jumped 18% year over year while missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,134 million. Excluding noncomparable sales related to acquisitions and divestitures, as well as currency movements, net sales grew 1%. The uptick in comparable net sales can be attributed to the higher volume/mix (up 1%), whereas net price realization remained neutral.&nbsp;<br /><br />The gross profit went up 22% due to the improved volume mix and a positive impact of the Hostess Brands acquisition, partly negated by the impact of divestitures. The adjusted gross profit grew 29%.&nbsp;<br /><br />The adjusted operating income jumped 35% year over year to $447.9 million.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Decoding SJM&rsquo;s Segmental Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>U.S. Retail Pet Foods: </strong>The segment&rsquo;s sales tumbled 9% to $399.7 million. The volume/mix had a six-percentage-point adverse impact on net sales, with the net price realization lowering the same by four percentage points. The segment&rsquo;s profit surged 42% to $115.3 million.<br /><br /><strong>U.S. Retail Coffee: </strong>The segment&rsquo;s sales remained nearly flat at $623.4 million as the favorable volume/mix was offset by adverse net price realization. The segment&rsquo;s profit rose 1% to $172.6 million.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>U.S. Retail Frozen Handheld and Spreads: </strong>Sales in the segment increased 7% to $496.8 million. Excluding noncomparable sales in the year-ago period related to the divested Sahale Snacks business, net sales grew 9%. The volume/mix boosted net sales by 7%, and the net price realization aided net sales by one percentage point. The segment&rsquo;s profit jumped 13% to $119 million.<br /><br /><strong>Sweet Baked Snacks: </strong>Sales in the segment came in at $333.7 million, with the segment profit amounting to $74.4 million in the first quarter.<br /><br /><strong>International and Away from Home:</strong> Net sales dropped 1% to $271.5 million. Excluding the impact of noncomparable net sales associated with divestitures and currency movements, net sales grew 8%. The volume/mix had a three-percentage-point positive effect, and the net price realization had a positive impact of five percentage points on combined segment net sales. The segment&rsquo;s profit increased 34% to $48.6 million.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">SJM&rsquo;s Financial Health Snapshot</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The J. M. Smucker exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $39.5 million, long-term debt (net of current portion) of $6,775.3 million and total shareholders&rsquo; equity of $7,769.5 million.<br /><br />Cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to $172.9 million for the three months ended July 31, 2024. Free cash flow was $49.2 million in the same time frame.&nbsp;<br /><br />Free cash flow and capital expenditures are likely to be $875 million and $450 million, respectively, in fiscal 2025.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What to Expect From SJM in Fiscal 2025?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For fiscal 2025, SJM now anticipates comparable net sales to increase nearly 0.5-1.5% compared with the earlier view of 1.5-2.5%.&nbsp;<br /><br />Fiscal 2025 net sales are anticipated to increase 8.5-9.5% now compared with the earlier view of 9.5-10.5%. The revised net sales guidance reflects a dynamic consumer landscape shaped by ongoing inflationary pressures and reduced discretionary income, which is impacting the dog snacks and sweet baked goods categories. It considers the anticipated effects of demand elasticity within the coffee portfolio due to further pricing actions driven by higher-than-expected green coffee costs. However, these challenges are partially offset by heightened expectations for Uncrustables sandwiches.<br /><br />The adjusted EPS for fiscal 2025 is envisioned in the $9.60-$10 band, down from the $9.80-$10.20 range expected before. The company recorded an adjusted EPS of $9.94 in fiscal 2024.&nbsp;<br /><br />The revised bottom-line guidance takes into account the updated net sales view, an adjusted gross profit margin of nearly 37.5% (indicating greater than expected green coffee costs) and a roughly 9% rise in SD&amp;A expenses. The company had earlier expected the adjusted gross margin to be nearly 38% and SD&amp;A expenses to rise 13%.<br /><br />Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 11.3% over the past three months compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 2.3%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Better-Ranked Staple Bets</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Chef&rsquo;s Warehouse</strong> CHEF, which distributes specialty food and center-of-the-plate products, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 33.7%, on average. CHEF currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong><br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for The Chef&rsquo;s Warehouse&rsquo;s current financial-year sales and earnings calls for growth of 9.7% and 12.6%, respectively, from the prior-year reported level.<br /><br /><strong>Vital Farms</strong> VITL offers a range of produced pasture-raised foods. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). VITL has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 82.5%, on average.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vital Farms&rsquo; current financial-year earnings indicates growth of 72.9% from the year-ago reported numbers.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Nomad Foods</strong> NOMD, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, manufactures and distributes frozen foods. NOMD has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.1%, on average.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Nomad Foods&rsquo; current financial-year sales and earnings implies growth of 4.3% and 11.5%, respectively, from the prior-year reported level.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328350/the-j-m-smucker-q1-earnings-top-estimates-sjm-stock-down-on-view-cut?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2328350">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ HPE Aruba Expands Clientele: Should You Buy, Hold or Sell the Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hewlett Packard Enterprise</strong> HPE shares have returned 12.8% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry&rsquo;s growth of 16.2%. Macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical issues have kept the broader stock market highly volatile this year so far, and HPE stock has not been spared.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite these short-term challenges, Hewlett Packard Enterprise&#39;s long-term prospect seems bright as the company continues to gain customers for its products and solutions. For instance, HPE&rsquo;s Aruba Networking recently upgraded advanced secure connectivity at Nobu Hotels&rsquo; select locations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hewlett Packard Enterprise equipped Nobu Hotels with its network infrastructure that is built on HPE Aruba and uses Zero Trust measures. It has installed artificial intelligence (AI)-based wired, wireless and SD-WAN solutions for Nobu Hotels to enhance guest experience and ensure constant connectivity and security.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Aruba deployment will involve the setup of HPE Aruba Networking Central, HPE Aruba Networking ClearPass and HPE Aruba Networking User Experience Insight. These solutions will enhance the connectivity of mobile, IoT devices and AI-based applications. Accommodations, including door automation, security cameras, digital voice assistants, lighting, window blinds and in-room orders, will be installed. The solution will also be used to simplify the work of hospitality staff so they can focus better on customer service.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and Consensus</h3><h2> <img alt="Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and Consensus" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/9f/1724853110.png" style="width: 610px; height: 281px;" title="" /> </h2><p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company price-consensus-chart | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Quote</p></div><h2>Aruba&rsquo;s Robust Capabilities Aid HPE</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The rising adoption of Aruba Networking by organizations worldwide can be credited to the ongoing enhancements that HPE is continuously making to improve the solution&#39;s capabilities.&nbsp; So far this year, HPE added two new features to Aruba Networking.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hewlett Packard Enterprise added GenAI LLM models in HPE Aruba Networking Central&rsquo;s search feature to improve its accuracy. The company also launched HPE Aruba Networking Enterprise Private 5G, making HPE the world&rsquo;s first company to provide Wi-Fi and private 5G solutions together.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the pending acquisition of <strong>Juniper Networks </strong>JNPR is poised to strengthen HPE&#39;s networking portfolio, enabling the company to offer comprehensive solutions that integrate networking, security and cloud services.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These enhancements in Aruba Networking&rsquo;s capabilities will help Hewlett Packard Enterprise in acquiring new clients. So far this year, the Aruba Networking solution has gained several clients for HPE, including Berger Paints, Nice Brazil, the city of Carmel, Royal Jaarbeurs, Houston Airports, Bethesda Health Group, University of Maryland and Dedini S/A Ind&uacute;strias de Base.</p><h2>HPE Enhancing Aruba Networking Competitiveness</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">By continuously enhancing Aruba Networking&rsquo;s capabilities, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been able to gain a competitive advantage in edge networking over its long-term competitor, <strong>Cisco</strong> CSCO, in the networking market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cisco is a networking company that is more focused on the security side of networking and AI. HPE has now combined WiFi, compute, storage, SaaS and its financial services to deliver the most comprehensive edge to cloud architecture.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hewlett Packard Enterprise&rsquo;s other formidable competitor in the networking space is <strong>Dell Technologies</strong> DELL. Although both companies target enterprise customers, the modus operandi of installing the networking architecture is different for both players.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While Dell&rsquo;s architecture is based on open networking that focuses on separating the hardware from the operating system, HPE is based on zero trust security, wireless edge-to-cloud and unified infrastructure. The two different types of approaches to networking give the customers an opportunity to choose networking per their architecture while increasing the competition in this space.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The pending acquisition of Juniper Networks aligns with Hewlett Packard Enterprise&#39;s goal to expand its presence in the enterprise networking space. Juniper Networks&rsquo; advanced network infrastructure technologies, combined with HPE&rsquo;s existing capabilities, are expected to create a powerful synergy. This will allow HPE to provide more robust and secure networking options, enhancing its competitiveness in the market.</p><h2>HPE&rsquo;s Mixed Q3 Guidance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Hewlett Packard forecasts revenues between $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.64 billion, indicating growth of 9.1% year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company estimates non-GAAP net earnings per share in the range of 43-48 cents, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 46 cents, indicating a decline of 6.1% year over year.</p><h2>What Investors Should Do With HPE Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Hewlett Packard Enterprise&#39;s efforts to strengthen its market position and expand its networking capabilities are likely to drive sustained performance improvements over the long run. Additionally, the Value score of A reflects that the stock is relatively cheap at present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, a softened IT spending environment amid macroeconomic headwinds and rising competition might undermine its near-term growth prospects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">HPE stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328417/hpe-aruba-expands-clientele-should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_tech_sector-2328417">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ ChargePoint, Daimler Buses Tie Up for Telematics System Integration ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:46:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.</strong> CHPT, an electric vehicle charging network provider, and Daimler Buses have signed a collaboration agreement to allow transportation companies with multi-brand fleets to utilize vehicle data from Mercedes-Benz and Setra buses in ChargePoint&rsquo;s fleet management system without the need for extra hardware.<br /><br />Daimler Buses offers a variety of connectivity solutions through its Omniplus On digital services. Customers can use these services via the Omniplus On portal, integrate vehicle data into telemetry systems, or through partner applications. Currently, 15 major European telematics and depot management system providers offer a Data-as-a-Service portfolio, which allows Daimler Buses&rsquo; vehicle data to be integrated into fleet management systems for improved analysis and management. ChargePoint is now joining as a key telematics provider.<br /><br />The agreement provides several benefits to ChargePoint customers with Mercedes-Benz and Setra in their fleets. It eliminates the need for additional hardware installation as CHPT can utilize data from the Bus Data Center, a standard feature in all Daimler Buses. Customers need a monthly data package from Omniplus On, available for each bus, along with data authorization from the transportation company. The Bus Data Center provides real-time transmission of more than 450 data points, including all vehicle diagnostic information, and can receive commands via the mobile network, such as preconditioning the eCitaro.<br /><br />ChargePoint customers using Daimler Buses vehicles also benefit from high-level data security. Daimler Buses is the first bus manufacturer to comply with the new international cybersecurity directive UN ECE R155, which ensures that the data is consistently protected from unauthorized access throughout the entire connectivity chain, from the vehicle to the Daimler Buses cloud.<br /><br />CHPT went public in February 2021 and exceeded its revenue growth expectations in fiscal 2022 and 2023. However, in fiscal 2024, due to slower EV market growth and a challenging macro environment, it lost its momentum. Most of ChargePoint&#39;s revenues come from its chargers, sold at a loss, rather than from higher-margin subscriptions. In fiscal 2024, CHPT&rsquo;s adjusted EBITDA losses increased from $217 million to $273 million. Despite challenges, ChargePoint expects its business to stabilize in the second half of fiscal 2025 by expanding subscription services, resolving inventory issues and growing its Asian manufacturing operations. It anticipates positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.</p><h2>Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">CHPT currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).<br /><br />Some other top-ranked stocks in the auto space are <strong>Dorman Products, Inc. </strong>DORM, <strong>Blue Bird Corporation</strong> BLBD and <strong>Douglas Dynamics, Inc.</strong> PLOW, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for DORM&rsquo;s 2024 sales and earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 3.71% and 35.46%, respectively. EPS estimates for 2024 and 2025 have improved 51 cents and 37 cents, respectively, in the past 30 days.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BLBD&rsquo;s 2024 sales and earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 17.58% and 215.89%, respectively. EPS estimates for 2024 and 2025 have improved 65 cents and 80 cents, respectively, in the past 30 days.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLOW&rsquo;s 2024 sales and earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 6.45% and 60.4%, respectively. EPS estimates for 2024 have improved 15 cents in the past 30 days.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328416/chargepoint-daimler-buses-tie-up-for-telematics-system-integration?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_corporate_actions-2328416">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Costamare Stock Surges 23% YTD: What's Next for Investors? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:43:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Costamare</strong> CMRE has displayed an impressive performance, with its shares appreciating 22.6% year to date. This growth is impressive and has outperformed its industry. CMRE stock has also performed better than other shipping stocks like <strong>Frontline plc</strong> FRO and <strong>Star Bulk Carriers</strong> SBLK. The bullishness in the stock is fueled by favorable market sentiments pertaining to dry bulk shipping and its focus on fleet modernization and capacity enhancement.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">YTD Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/89/75674.jpg?v=1547405" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Closing at $13.94 on Aug. 27, the stock trades at a discount of 20.7% to its 52-week high mark of $17.58 reached on June 24. Moreover, the stock&rsquo;s current level reflects a premium of 63% from its 52-week low.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the recent rally, the question that naturally arises is whether Costamare stock can sustain its bullish price performance or should investors book profits now. Before that, let&#39;s delve deep to unearth the reasons behind this northward price movement.</p><h2>Factors Working in Favor of the CMRE Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of CMRE are being aided by favorable market conditions in the dry bulk sector. Factors like a build-up of iron ore inventories in China have resulted in higher capesize freight rates.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&#39;s dry bulk and containership fleets are being aided by the ongoing Red Sea tensions. Reduced container availability due to the Red Sea tensions has resulted in a rise in freight costs. CMRE stock is being aided by the uptick in dry bulk rates. Lower capacity is expected to boost earnings. Rates are likely to remain high for quite some time, which should aid shipping stocks like Costamare. The company&rsquo;s focus on fleet modernization and leasing is also impressive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Costamare&rsquo;s shareholder-friendly approach throws light on its financial bliss. The shipping company pays out a quarterly dividend of 11.5 cents (46 cents annualized) per share, which gives it a 3.3% yield at the current stock price. (Check Costamare&rsquo;s dividend history here).</p><h2>Impressive Valuation Picture for CMRE Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">From a valuation perspective, Costamare is trading relatively cheaply. CMRE is currently trading at a forward sales multiple of 0.99, below its median over the last five years and also at a discount compared to the broader industry. The company has a Value Score of A.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/5e/75677.jpg?v=2032077951" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Key Headwinds: Escalated Debt &amp; High Costs</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the above-mentioned tailwinds, there are a couple of factors that one has to be mindful of. Even though Costamare is attractively valued and has strong fundamentals, we are concerned about its high debt levels.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Long-Term Debt to Capitalization</strong></h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3a/75679.jpg?v=71856482" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">CMRE&rsquo;s expenses are shooting up, mainly voyage costs. Voyage costs skyrocketed 463% in 2023 from the 2022 level. High fuel costs are also pushing up total expenses. High costs hinder bottom-line growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the headwinds surrounding the stock, earnings estimates have been southbound, as shown below.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/30/75680.jpg?v=1586046981" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>To Sum Up</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">There is no doubt that the stock is attractively valued and upbeat dry bulk market conditions are serving the CMRE stock well. Given the abovementioned headwinds, we believe that it is not the right time to buy CMRE stock. We can safely conclude that investors should refrain from rushing to buy CMRE now as it is facing quite a few challenges.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, they should monitor the company&rsquo;s developments closely for a more appropriate entry point. For those who already own the stock, it will be prudent to stay invested. The stock&rsquo;s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) supports our thesis. You can see&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328404/costamare-stock-surges-23-ytd-what-s-next-for-investors?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2328404">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Descartes' Solutions Witness Steady Traction: Will the Stock Gain? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Descartes Systems Group Inc.</strong> DSGX portfolio of solutions is gaining steady traction. DSGX recently announced that Brazil-based Solar Coca-Cola is utilizing its route execution and fleet performance management solution to enhance the last-mile delivery performance for more than 1,400 drivers across 44 distribution centers and 13 production facilities, covering 70% of Brazil.<br /><br />Solar Coca-Cola is focused on improving its logistics processes through automation. Descartes&rsquo; solution has provided a unified &ldquo;mobile-based platform&rdquo; to manage daily routes for its drivers and supervisors. This solution continuously &ldquo;resequences&rdquo; routes based on real-time traffic, delivery windows and weather conditions, improving driver performance and giving supervisors better insight into distribution operations.<br /><br />Moreover, drivers can use the same app to capture customer information directly at the point of delivery, while supervisors can track driver progress and status updates throughout the day, adding significant value to their high-service environment. Solar Coca-Cola added that such efficiency would be unattainable through manual processes, which are time-consuming and not scalable.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>The Descartes Systems Group Inc. Price and Consensus</h3> <img alt="The Descartes Systems Group Inc. Price and Consensus" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/d3/1724851992.png" title="" width="581" /> <p>The Descartes Systems Group Inc. price-consensus-chart | The Descartes Systems Group Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Descartes&#39; route execution and fleet performance management solution, part of its broader routing, mobile and telematics suite, assists retail food and beverage distributors like Solar Coca-Cola in managing routes for optimal efficiency. It minimizes the impact of unforeseen events on customer service levels, mileage and costs by continually re-optimizing route plans based on real-time traffic data and other variables.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In early August, DSGX&rsquo;s cloud-based transportation management system (TMS) solution was implemented by Nynas AB to automate communications across the customer order lifecycle. The TMS solution will enhance communication with carriers, freight forwarders, customs agents, independent inspectors and Nynas&rsquo; main storage hub, supporting diverse shipments across Europe, where the company mainly operates.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">DSGX&rsquo;s Gains From Healthy Uptake of Solutions &amp; Buyouts</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Momentum in real-time visibility, global trade intelligence, routing and scheduling solutions and e-commerce business is driving DSGX&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the last reported quarter, Services revenues (contributed 91% to total revenues) amounted to $137.8 million, up 11% year over year. The uptick was primarily attributable to an increase in sales to an expanded customer base of global trade intelligence, routing and transportation management solutions.<br /><br />DGSX has also been active on the acquisition front. Buyouts have aided the company&rsquo;s growth by expanding its product portfolio and adding competence. Synergies arising from the acquisition of OCR and Thyme ASD, along with healthy momentum in services revenues, led to 11% year-over-year growth in total revenues in the fiscal first quarter.

<![CDATA[ Addex Stock Soars on Crucial Update From Indivior Research Deal ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>Addex Therapeutics</strong> ADXN soared 54.6% after the company announced the selection of clinical candidates from the GABAB positive allosteric modulator (PAM) research collaboration with <strong>Indivior PLC</strong> INDV.</p><h2>Addex &amp; Indivior Research Deal Update</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per the press release, Indivior has chosen a compound for future development in treating substance use disorder and will manage all further development efforts. Under the terms of the existing agreement, Addex is eligible to receive up to $330 million if certain regulatory, clinical and commercial milestones are met, along with tiered royalties on net sales from INDV, ranging from high single digits to low double digits. Subject to successful development, such payments will aid ADXN in strengthening in cash position as it continues to build its portfolio of novel treatments for neurological disorders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date, shares of Addex have rallied 91.4% against the industry&rsquo;s 1% decline.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/5f/75683.jpg?v=688259138" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Indivior stated that the distinguished mechanism of its selected substance use disorder treatment candidate could help overcome the complex challenges in this field to potentially develop new therapies. INDV expects to begin investigational new drug application (IND) enabling studies of the candidate in the first half of 2025.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Addex has exercised its option to select a compound to further develop its independent GABAB PAM program to treat chronic cough. ADXN also expects to initiate IND-enabling studies for its candidate in 2025.</p><h2>Addex&rsquo;s Setback on Failure of Partner-Sponsored Epilepsy Drug Study</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">This significant development in the collaboration agreement with Indivior comes at a crucial time after Addex faced a major setback last month. Its other partner, <strong>J&amp;J</strong> JNJ, informed the company that it has discontinued the development of the investigational candidate, ADX71149 (JNJ-40411813), in epilepsy.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the absence of a marketed product, Addex only earns revenues from its ongoing collaborations. If the JNJ collaboration comes to an end, the company will lose a significant portion of its revenues, which could lead to a shortage of cash to fund developmental activities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">J&amp;J&rsquo;s decision to discontinue the epilepsy study was based on disappointing results from the mid-stage study of ADX71149. Per the data readout, the candidate, in combination with standard of care treatment in patients with focal onset seizures with suboptimal response to levetiracetam or brivaracetam, failed to achieve the primary endpoint of statistically significant time for patients to reach baseline seizure count.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although the collaboration remains ongoing until the totality of the phase II epilepsy data is analyzed, it is likely that the partnership with JNJ will soon dissolve once the same is complete.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Addex Therapeutics Ltd.

<![CDATA[ Pre-Markets Flat Ahead of Hotly Anticipated NVIDIA Q2 Numbers ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:27:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Wednesday, August 28th, 2024</strong><br /><br />Pre-market futures are down gently this Hump Day, now squarely in the shadow of <strong>NVIDIA&rsquo;s</strong> NVDA Q2 earnings report after today&rsquo;s close. We may tend to think market participants are spending an inordinate amount of time on one stock, but if there had to be one in the year 2024, this would be it.<br /><br /><h2>Expectations for NVIDIA&rsquo;s Q2 Earnings<br /></h2><br />There are only a few companies on the planet with a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, and none of these have gained nearly 3000% in share price over the past five years. NVIDIA has always been known as an innovator: it created the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), or what you may think of as a video microchip. And they are now ubiquitous.<br /><br />Over the past year and a half or so, the big trade has been in Artificial Intelligence (AI), and here NVIDIA has been a market leader, as well. Data Center development is key in the AI space, and this is where NVIDIA has gotten well ahead of most of its competition.<br /><br />Thus, Growth at the company has earned an A from the Zacks Style metric, and Momentum gets an A, as well. However, Value for NVIDIA shares currently has an F. Yet the company expects +137% earnings per share growth in Q2 reported this afternoon, and +110% in quarterly revenues. The company currently rides a six-quarter positive earnings surprise streak, with a trailing four-quarter average beat of +18%.<br /><br /><h2>Kohl&rsquo;s Shares Up on Q2 Beat<br /></h2><br />This morning, department store operator <strong>Kohl&rsquo;s</strong> KSS outperformed expectations on both top and bottom lines in its Q2 report this morning. Earnings of 59 cents per share outpaces the 46 cents anticipated (and better than the 52 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter) on $3.73 billion in sales, +1.85% above the Zacks consensus.&nbsp;<br /><br />It also represents a nice bounceback from the -700% earnings per share miss in Kohl&rsquo;s prior quarter. Yet year-over-year comps were down -5% in Q2, even with its Sephora component performing well in Kohl&rsquo;s stores. But raised guidance has helped bumped shares up +4% in today&rsquo;s pre-market; it had been trading down -30% year to date. For more on KSS&rsquo; earnings, click here.</p><p><h2>Another Big Beat and Raise for Abercrombie in Q2<br /></h2><br /><strong>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</strong> ANF more than doubled its earnings year over year &mdash; coming in at $2.50 cents per share, well above the $2.14 in the Zacks consensus. Revenues of $1.13 billion easily surpassed the $1.09 billion, representing +21% growth from one year ago. And guidance has been raised at the Ohio-based retaler.<br /><br />Yet shares are trading the news down -10% in today&rsquo;s pre-market, on an &ldquo;increasingly uncertain environment&rdquo; for the Abercrombie brands, which include Hollister and Gilly Hicks. Also, the stock, after posting an average 210% earnings beat in its trailing four quarters, had been bid up nearly +90% year to date. So consider this sell-off a booking of profits.<br /><br /><h2>Smucker&rsquo;s Shares Down Following Mixed Fiscal Q1<br /></h2><br />America&rsquo;s pantry stocker, <strong>J.M. Smucker Co. </strong>SJM, posted a nearly +12% earnings per share surprise this morning in its fiscal Q1 report: $2.44 per share versus $2.18 in the Zacks consensus (and better than the $2.21 per share posted in the year-ago quarter). Revenues were slightly below estimates, however, with its $2.13 billion missing expectations by -0.42%. Thus, the shares are down another -3.5% in early trading, adding to the -4.5% the stock has brought in year to date.

<![CDATA[ Soleno Stock Up as FDA Accepts PWS Drug NDA Under Priority Review ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Soleno Therapeutics&nbsp;</strong>SLNO gained 6.3% on Aug. 27 after the FDA accepted the new drug application (NDA) seeking approval for its lead candidate, DCCR (diazoxide choline) extended-release tablets, to treat Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in patients aged four years and older who have hyperphagia, under the Priority Review pathway. A filing designated as a Priority Review reduces the review period to four months. A final decision from the FDA is expected on Dec. 27, 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The regulatory body in the United States further stated that it plans to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss Soleno&rsquo;s application for DCCR.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DCCR is a novel, oral, once-daily extended-release dosage form containing diazoxide choline, the crystalline salt of diazoxide. Although not approved for treating PWS, the parent molecule, diazoxide, treats a few rare diseases in neonates, infants, children and adults.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Soleno has established extensive patent protection for the therapeutic use of diazoxide, diazoxide choline and DCCR in PWS patients. Diazoxide choline&nbsp;enjoys the FDA&rsquo;s Breakthrough, Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations in the United States. In the EU, the candidate enjoys the Orphan Drug Designation for the same indication.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date, shares of SLNO have rallied 21.8% against the industry&rsquo;s 1% decline.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/86/75682.jpg?v=1230997519" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per the PWS Association USA, approximately one in every 15,000 newborns suffer from this rare genetic disorder. The most common symptom of PWS is hyperphagia, an abnormally increased appetite for food, often leading to excessive eating, which takes a serious toll on the quality of life of patients suffering from it. In the long term, hyperphagia often leads to co-morbidities, such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, there are no approved treatments for hyperphagia/appetite, metabolic, cognitive function or behavioral aspects of PWS. This represents a significant unmet medical need.</p><h2>Soleno&rsquo;s Competition in the Target Market</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that last year, <strong>Acadia Pharmaceuticals</strong> ACAD also added a new study candidate to its rare disease portfolio, carbetocin nasal spray (ACP-101), to treat hyperphagia associated with PWS. Acadia acquired worldwide rights to develop and commercialize carbetocin nasal spray with the acquisition of Levo Therapeutics in June 2022.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a previous late-stage study conducted by Levo, carbetocin demonstrated a nominally statistically significant reduction in hyperphagia-related behaviors in PWS patients. Consequently, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Acadia initiated a pivotal phase III COMPASS PWS study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the candidate for the same indication.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Soleno Therapeutics, Inc.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kohl&#39;s Corporation</strong> KSS posted mixed second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with the bottom line increasing year over year and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the top line declined and missed the consensus mark.<br /><br />During the quarter, KSS faced pressure from a challenging consumer environment and a decline in its core business. Customers became more selective with their spending, leading to lower sales despite an increase in transaction frequency. This overshadowed robust performance in key growth areas, including Sephora, home decor, gifting and impulse purchases.<br /><br />Despite the challenges, Kohl&#39;s saw an improved gross margin along with better inventory and expense management. The company remains optimistic about its growth efforts, including an upcoming partnership with Babies &ldquo;R&rdquo; Us. It revised its sales outlook downward while raising its earnings guidance for the fiscal 2024.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Kohl&#39;s Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p>&nbsp;</p> <img alt="Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="268" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/f8/1724853537.png" title="" width="577" /> <p>Kohl&#39;s Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Kohl&#39;s Corporation Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Kohl&rsquo;s Quarterly Results Overview: Key Financial Metrics</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Kohl&#39;s posted earnings of 59 cents per share compared with earnings of 52 cents posted in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. The upside can be attributed to gross margin expansion and robust inventory and expense management.<br /><br />Total revenues came in at $3,732 million, down from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s level of $3,895 million. Net sales fell 4.2% year over year to $3,525 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line was pegged at $3,802.2 million. Comparable sales declined 5.1% year over year.<br /><br />Kohl&#39;s gross margin expanded 59 basis points (bps) to 39.6% in the reported quarter. SG&amp;A expenses dropped 4.2% to $1,250 million. As a percentage of total revenues, SG&amp;A inched down 1 basis points (bps) to 33.5%.<br /><br />KSS posted an operating income of $166 million, up from $163 million in the year-ago period. The operating income margin expanded by 26 bps to 4.4%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">KSS&rsquo;s Financial Health Snapshot</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $231 million and shareholders&rsquo; equity of $3,830 million. The company provided an operating cash flow of $247 million for six months ended Aug. 3, 2024.<br /><br />Management expects capital expenditures of nearly $500 million for 2024 (including the expansion of its Sephora collaboration and store-related investments).<br /><br />On Aug. 13, 2024, Kohl&rsquo;s declared a quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents per share, payable on Sep. 25, to shareholders of record as of Sep. 11.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/91/75755.jpg?v=625186036" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What to Expect From KSS in the Fiscal 2024?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For the fiscal 2024, Kohl&#39;s forecasts a net sales decline of 4-6%, a revision from the previous expectation of a 2-4% decline. Comparable sales are projected to move down 3-5% compared with the earlier forecast of a 1-3% decline. The operating margin is expected to range from 3.4% to 3.8% compared with the prior estimate of 3-3.5%. Management anticipates earnings per share to be between $1.75 and $2.25, revising the earlier forecast of $1.25 to $1.85.<br /><br />Shares of the company have declined 28.1% in the past three months compared with the industry&rsquo;s decline of 22%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">3 Solid Retail Bets</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sprouts Farmers</strong> SFM, which is engaged in the retailing of fresh, natural and organic food products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprouts Farmers&rsquo; current financial-year sales and earnings implies growth of around 9.6% and 18.7%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.<br /><br /><strong>Boot Barn Holdings, Inc.</strong> BOOT currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. BOOT has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.1%, on average.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boot Barn&rsquo;s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 10.7% and 8.9%, respectively, from the year-ago levels.<br /><br /><strong>PriceSmart, Inc.</strong> PSMT, which owns and operates U.S.-style membership shopping warehouse clubs, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). PSMT delivered an earnings surprise of 10.2% in the last reported quarter.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PriceSmart&rsquo;s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 11.3% and 14.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328359/kohl-s-q2-earnings-top-sales-decline-amid-consumer-challenges?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2328359">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 5 Stocks That Powered Dow ETFs Over the Past Week ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:19:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average touched record highs in the past couple of days on expectations that the Fed would soon cut interest rates. The blue-chip index gained about 1% over the past week, outperforming the other indices. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.5% while the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.3% in the same time frame (read: Dow Jones Outperforms: 5 ETFs That You Can Bet On).<br /><br /><strong>SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF</strong> DIA, which tracks the Dow Jones Index, has gained 0.9% in a week. While most of the stocks in the ETF portfolio have been rising, we have highlighted five that have been leading the way higher. These are <strong>American Express Company</strong> AXP, <strong>The Travelers Companies Inc.</strong> TRV, <strong>The Coca-Cola Company</strong> KO, <strong>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. </strong>JPM and <strong>Caterpillar</strong> CAT.<br /><br />Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that interest rate cuts are coming in September, citing easing inflation and a weakening job market. At the Fed&rsquo;s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Powell said, &ldquo;the time has come&rdquo; to lower borrowing costs in the light of a diminishing upside risk to inflation and moderating labor demand.&rdquo; &ldquo;The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.&rdquo; The probability of a 25-bps rate cut stands at 69.5%, while that of a 50-bps cut is at 30.5%, according to the latest CME Group&#39;s FedWatch tool (read: 5 Sector ETFs Scaling New Highs on Fed Minutes).<br /><br />Lower rates primarily benefit cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and consumer discretionary. Being highly exposed to cyclical sectors, the blue-chip index is set to outperform from this trend. Lower rates generally lead to reduced borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards and other consumer and business loans. This helps businesses to expand their operations more easily, resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, stimulates economic growth and boosts the stock market.&nbsp;<br /><br />Additionally, fading AI trades are taking a toll on the most loving technology sector, benefiting the undervalued cyclical sectors.</p><h2>DIA in Focus</h2><p>SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with an AUM of $35 billion and an average daily volume of 3.3 million shares. It tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, holding 30 stocks in its basket, with each making up for less than 9.4% share. Financials (23.4%), healthcare (19%), information technology (18.7%), consumer discretionary (14.7%) and industrials (13.7%) are the top five sectors.&nbsp;<br /><br />SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF charges 16 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Best-Performing Stocks of DIA</h2><p><strong>American Express </strong>is a diversified financial services company offering charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services worldwide. Shares of AXP have risen 3.6% over the past week. American Express earnings are expected to grow 17% this year. It makes up for a 4% share in the DIA portfolio. It has a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Travelers</strong> is principally engaged in providing a wide variety of property and casualty insurance and surety products and services to businesses, organizations and individuals in the United States and select international markets. The stock has gained 3.5% over the past week and accounts for a 3.1% share in the fund&rsquo;s basket. Travelers has an expected earnings growth rate of 30.9% for this year. TRV stock has a Zacks Rank #3.<br /><br /><strong>Coca-Cola</strong> is a beverage company that manufactures, markets and sells various nonalcoholic beverages worldwide. The company provides sparkling soft drinks, sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee, and tea; juice, value-added dairy, and plant-based beverages; and other beverages. It has jumped nearly 1% over the past week and accounts for 2.8% in the fund&rsquo;s basket. KO is expected to see earnings growth of 5.9% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #3 (read: ETFs to Tap as Consumer Sentiment Improves).&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>JPMorgan</strong> is one of the biggest global banks, with assets worth 4.14 trillion and stockholders&rsquo; equity worth $340.6 billion as of June 30, 2024. The stock has gained 2.6% in a week and makes up for 3.5% in DIA portfolio. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 3.4% for this year. JPMorgan currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

<![CDATA[ 3 Consistent Dividend Growers to Buy for Passive Income: TSM, MO, CAH ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Everybody loves dividends, as they provide a passive income stream, limit drawdowns in other positions, and provide more than one way to profit from an investment.</p><p>And when considering dividend-paying stocks, those with a history of boosting their payout are prime considerations, reflecting their commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders.</p><p>In addition, consistent dividend hikes reflect the company&rsquo;s successful nature, opting to share profits with shareholders.</p><p>For those seeking companies that have consistently boosted payouts over time, Cardinal Health CAH, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, and Altria MO fit the criteria. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at each.</p><h2><strong>Cardinal Health Posts Strong Growth</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cardinal Health is a nationwide drug distributor and provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers, and manufacturers. It recently enjoyed a strong quarter, posting 29% EPS growth on the back of 12% higher sales while also lifting its current year guidance.</p><p>The company&rsquo;s sales growth has been consistent throughout its history, as seen in the chart below.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1c/75627.jpg?v=910987092" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Strong cash-generating abilities have given it the flexibility to continuously reward shareholders, holding a spot in the elite Dividend Aristocrats club. For a quick refresher, Dividend Aristocrats are S&amp;P 500 companies that have upped quarterly payouts for at least 25 consecutive years.</p><p>Impressively, CAH posted record operating and free cash flow throughout its latest period. Below is a chart illustrating the company&rsquo;s dividend paid on an annual basis.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ee/75628.jpg?v=475261122" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><strong>TSM Shares Benefit from AI Trade</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Taiwan Semiconductor, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has seen its earnings outlook shift bullishly across the board following favorable quarterly results that reflect rock-solid demand. Concerning headline figures in the latest print, TSM saw 30% EPS growth on 33% higher sales, continuing its recent growth trajectory.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fb/75630.jpg?v=1818783742" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The company has long been a favorite among income-focused investors who are also seeking chip exposure, carrying a 5.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Shares have overall benefited nicely on the back of the semiconductor trade fueled by AI this year, up more than 60%.</p><p>Below is a chart illustrating the company&rsquo;s dividends paid on an annual basis.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6c/75629.jpg?v=1088152437" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Though shares have had a strong run in 2024, investors aren&rsquo;t overpaying for the company&rsquo;s forecasted growth, with the current 0.8X PEG ratio reflecting a considerable discount to the 1.3X five-year median and five-year highs of 3.4X.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8e/75631.jpg?v=385618016" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><strong>Altria Undergoes Transformation</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like CAH, Altria has long been a favorite among income-focused investors, also holding the ranks of a Dividend Aristocrat through years of consistently higher payouts. The tobacco giant has undergone significant transformation over recent years due to rising health fears, now expanding into the smokeless category.</p><p>Shares have been red-hot in 2024, gaining 37% compared to the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 19% gain.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c4/75632.jpg?v=1518693778" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>And for those seeking high yields, Altria shares have got that covered with a current 7.4% annual yield. The company&rsquo;s six dividend hikes over the past five years have translated to a 4% five-year annualized dividend growth rate, owing to its commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders.</p><p>The company paid dividends of $1.7 billion and $3.4 billion in the second quarter and first half of 2024, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/56/75633.jpg?v=1894826529" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everybody loves dividends, essentially investors&rsquo; form of payday. They can help limit drawdowns in other positions and provide a passive income stream, two key traits that all market participants enjoy.</p><p>And for those seeking companies with a consistent history of steady payouts, all three above &ndash; Cardinal Health CAH, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, and Altria MO &ndash; fit the criteria.</p><p>All three recently upped their quarterly payouts, continuing their shareholder-friendly nature.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2327960/3-consistent-dividend-growers-to-buy-for-passive-income-tsm-mo-cah?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-investment_ideas-2327960">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Biotech Stock Roundup: REGN's Drug Approval, LXRX, RYTM Stocks Gain on Update & More ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:11:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">It was a pretty low-key week for the biotech sector with nothing much from a majority of the bigwigs. <strong>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals</strong> REGN was in the spotlight after winning approval for an oncology drug.&nbsp; This apart, a few pipeline and regulatory updates were in focus.</p><h2><u><em>Recap of the Week&rsquo;s Most Important Stories</em></u>:</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Regeneron&rsquo;s Lymphoma Drug Approval</strong></em>:&nbsp; Regeneron announced that the European Commission (&ldquo;EC&rdquo;) approved odronextamab for treating adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) or R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The drug has been approved under the brand name Ordspono. The approval is based on results from the phase I ELM-1 and pivotal phase II ELM-2 trials, which demonstrated robust, durable response rates in adults with R/R FL or R/R DLBCL. The approval in the EU marks the first regulatory approval of Ordspono for patients across the world. Approval in the EU was mostly expected as the European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s (&ldquo;EMA&rdquo;) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommended approval of odronextamab. The EMA previously granted odronextamab the Orphan Designation for FL and DLBCL.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Regeneron is also investigating the use of odronextamab as a monotherapy and in combination across earlier lines of therapy in challenging-to-treat lymphomas.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">REGN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Update From Lexicon</strong></em>:&nbsp; <strong>Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc</strong>. LXRX announced that the FDA plans to hold an advisory panel meeting to give a recommendation on whether to approve Zynquista (sotagliflozin), which has been developed as an adjunct to insulin therapy for glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The meeting of the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee is scheduled for Oct. 31, 2024. However, despite scheduling an advisory committee meeting, the FDA did not change the PDUFA date of Dec. 20, 2024, for Zynquista.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lexicon&rsquo;s shares rose following the announcement. Per the notice provided to the company, the regulatory body is planning to make the background materials available to the public no less than two business days before the meeting is held.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Rhythm Stock Gains on Update</strong></em>: <strong>Rhythm Pharmaceuticals </strong>RYTM announced the FDA&rsquo;s acceptance of the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for its only marketed drug, Imcivree (setmelanotide), to treat obesity in children as young as two years old. The FDA granted Priority Review to the application. A final decision from the FDA is expected on Dec. 26, 2024. The company&rsquo;s shares rose on the news.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Imcivree, an MC4R agonist, is already approved in the United States and EU for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients aged six years and older. The eligible patient population includes those with monogenic or syndromic obesity due to Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) or pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), including proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rhythm&rsquo;s sNDA is looking to expand the eligible patient population for the drug by lowering the minimum required age to receive Imcivree treatment to two years in the United States. In July 2024, the drug&rsquo;s label was expanded in the EU to include children aged two years with obesity due to BBS or POMC/PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Galapagos Stock Up on Regulatory Update</strong></em>:&nbsp; <strong>Galapagos NV</strong> GLPG announced that the FDA cleared its investigational new drug application to begin an early to mid-stage study of GLPG5101 in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R NHL). Shares of GLPG rose on this update.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GLPG5101 is an autologous CD19 CAR-T cell therapy product candidate, which is administered as a single, fixed, intravenous dose. The planned phase I/II ATALANTA-1 study will evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of GLPG5101 for the R/R NHL indication in the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The main goal of the phase I portion of the ATALANTA-1 trial is to assess the safety and initial effectiveness of GLPG5101 to establish the appropriate dosage strength for the phase II portion. Additionally, the phase I portion will evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of decentralized manufacturing of GLPG5101 as a secondary objective.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The primary goal of the phase II portion is to assess the objective response rate, while secondary goals include evaluating the complete response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, pharmacokinetics and the feasibility of decentralized manufacturing. The treatment period for all enrolled patients will be 24 months.</p><h2>Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has gained 0.52% in the past five trading sessions and GSK&rsquo;s shares have risen 6.13%. In the past six months, shares of REGN have rallied 20.98%. (See the last biotech stock roundup here: <strong>Biotech Stock Roundup: CRL for REGN, GILDs Drug Approval, LQDA Down on News</strong>).</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d9/75758.jpg?v=1957126206" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>What&#39;s Next in Biotech?</h2><p>Stay tuned for more pipeline updates.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328356/biotech-stock-roundup-regn-s-drug-approval-lxrx-rytm-stocks-gain-on-update-more?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|stock_roundup-2328356">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Shell's Nigerian Onshore Asset Sale Faces Regulatory Hurdles ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:09:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shell plc&nbsp;</strong>SHEL is facing challenges in its efforts to divest its stake in the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited to Renaissance. The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (&ldquo;NUPRC&rdquo;) has rejected Shell International&rsquo;s proposal to sell its onshore assets in Nigeria to Renaissance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The deal was valued at $2.4 billion during the time of the announcement. However, the value has reportedly dropped to $1.3 billion at present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per the Petroleum Industry Act, the regulatory commission&rsquo;s approval is required to proceed with the transaction. However, the rejection by NUPRC poses a challenge for Shell and also raises concern regarding the International Oil Companies&#39; future asset sale in the country.</p><h2>NUPRC&rsquo;s Rejection &amp; Divestment Framework</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The reason behind the deal&rsquo;s rejection was the doubts regarding the buyer&rsquo;s ability to manage the assets (that were put up for sale by Shell). The NUPRC had put forward a divestment framework in April 2024. The framework was to assess the applications seeking ministerial approval for the sale of Shell&rsquo;s onshore assets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The framework evaluates several aspects, including the buyer&rsquo;s technological capabilities and financial strength. The framework also covers the legal aspects of the transaction, decommissioning and abandonment procedures, and data repatriation requirements. It also requires the buyer to account for any environmental damage related to its long-term operations in the region, maintain labor and industrial relations, and demonstrate a commitment to build trust with the host communities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NUPRC has highlighted that Renaissance must demonstrate its capability to manage the assets put up for sale. Renaissance is a consortium of local companies, which include ND Western Limited, Aradel Holdings Plc, the Petrolin Group, FIRST Exploration and Petroleum Development Company Limited, and Waltersmith Group.</p><h2>Further Challenges for Shell</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The transaction was further complicated because the British oil major&rsquo;s onshore assets are part of a legal dispute between Shell and local firm Global Gas and Refining Limited. The local company has sought a court injunction, which, if implemented, will pose further challenges for Shell. The injuction could prevent the NUPRC from approving the sale of the assets due to unresolved issues between the two companies regarding contractual terms and responsibilities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shell has stated that it is not selling its onshore assets directly to Renaissance. The transaction involves a transfer of shares, which means that it will only transfer the ownership of the assets to Renaissance. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The sale of Shell&rsquo;s Nigerian onshore assets has also been scrutinized by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and environmentalists. This raises concern about the transaction even further.</p><h2><strong>SHEL&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Key Picks</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, SHEL carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the energy&nbsp;sector are&nbsp;<strong>SM Energy</strong> SM, <strong>TechnipFMC plc </strong>FTI and&nbsp;<strong>MPLX LP </strong>MPLX. SM Energy presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while TechnipFMC and MPLX carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. <strong>You can see&nbsp;</strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here<strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">SM Energy is an upstream energy firm operating in the prolific Midland Basin and the South Texas regions. For 2024, the company expects its production to increase from the prior-year reported figure, signaling a bright production outlook.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TechnipFMC is a leading manufacturer and supplier of products, services and fully integrated technology solutions for the energy industry. The company&rsquo;s&nbsp;total backlog witnessed a record high of $13.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, indicating a year-over-year increase of 4.51%. This growing backlog ensures strong revenue growth for FTI in the future.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MPLX LP owns and operates a wide range of midstream assets. The partnership&#39;s midstream assets include oil and natural gas gathering systems and transportation pipelines for crude, natural gas and refined petroleum products. MPLX is least exposed to commodity price fluctuations as it generates stable fee-based revenues. Furthermore, it surpasses its industry peers in terms of distribution yield, reflecting its commitment to returning capital to its unitholders.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328354/shell-s-nigerian-onshore-asset-sale-faces-regulatory-hurdles?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_energy_sector-2328354">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>This year&rsquo;s market action has been fast and furious as stocks continue to build on their new bull market. Better-than-expected corporate earnings, decelerating inflation, and a lower interest rate outlook are all contributing to this recent surge. Sector rotation has been on full display as other areas of the market are passed the baton.</p><p>Insurance stocks are beginning to outperform and have displayed relatively little volatility. These stocks are often overlooked due to their stable nature. But as history has shown, they can generate above-average returns as buying pressure increases in these stocks.</p><p>The shift into defensive pockets has coincided with many individual insurance stocks now reflecting positive earnings estimate revisions, which our research has shown to be the most powerful force impacting stock prices.</p><p>One such company is Assurant AIZ, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. AIZ shares are outperforming the market and recently broke out to an all-time high. As we&rsquo;ll see, the company&rsquo;s traits make it a good candidate for a call option purchase.</p><h2><strong>The Zacks Rundown</strong></h2><p>Assurant is part of the Zacks Insurance &ndash; Multi Line industry group, which ranks in the top 25% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.</p><p>Stocks in this industry are also showing favorable valuation and earnings metrics as we can see below:</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/66/75711.jpg?v=529290615" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock&rsquo;s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p>While there are many ways to take advantage of a potentially bullish move in Assurant stock, options provide us with flexibility, enabling us to tailor our strategy to the current market environment.</p><h2><strong>Option Essentials</strong></h2><p>Before we analyze today&rsquo;s trade, let&rsquo;s review some option fundamentals as a refresher. There is no need to worry about complex mathematical formulas or equations. Over the years I&rsquo;ve found that the more complicated a strategy is, the less likely it is to work over the long run.</p><p>Options are standardized contracts that give the buyer the right &ndash; but not the obligation &ndash; to buy or sell the underlying stock at a fixed price, which is known as the strike price. A call option gives the buyer the right to buy a particular security, while a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the same. The investor who purchases an option, whether a put or call, is the option buyer, while the investor who sells a put or call is the seller or writer.</p><p>These contracts are valid for a specific period of time which ends on expiration day. There are weekly options, monthly options, and even LEAPS options which are longer-term options that have an expiration date of greater than one year.</p><p>Options consist of time value and intrinsic value. In-the-money options consist of both components; at-the-money and out-of-the-money options consist only of time value. At options expiration, options lose all time value.</p><p>Below we&rsquo;re going to explore a call option purchase strategy.</p><h2><strong>Multiply Your Insurance Returns</strong></h2><p>Assurant stock is in a price uptrend and displaying low volatility, making it a good candidate for a call option purchase:</p><p><img alt="StockCharts" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/46/75710.jpg?v=2020714156" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: StockCharts</span></p><p>When done correctly, trading options provides huge profit opportunities with limited risk.</p><p>In today&rsquo;s trade, we&rsquo;re going to target the October 18<sup>th</sup> expiration date and the 150-strike price. Purchasing this option gives us the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of AIZ stock at $150 on or before October 18<sup>th</sup>, which is a bit less than 2 months from now.</p><p>The table below displays the risk/reward profile for this trade. Assurant stock is currently trading at $190/share (orange box). We are purchasing 1 October 18 150-strike call at 40.8 points, which is the option premium. Since options account for 100 shares of the underlying stock, the total cost for this call option trade is $4,080 as we can see in the yellow highlighted box.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d3/75709.jpg?v=649780557" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The top (blue) row shows the performance of Assurant stock based on different percentage scenarios at expiration. The bottom (purple) row shows the corresponding percentage return for our call option trade. We can see that if Assurant remains flat, this trade would encounter a minor loss of 2%. If Assurant moves up 5%, this trade will realize a 21.3% profit. If AIZ stock advances 15%, we would realize a 67.9% profit.</p><p>This illustration shows the inherent leverage that options provide. A stock investor who bought 100 shares of AIZ would have to contribute $19,000, which is a much bigger investment. A 15% increase in the stock price would yield a $2,850 profit.</p><p>On the other hand, in this example the option trader only needs to contribute $4,080 to control the same amount of underlying AIZ shares. A 15% move in AIZ stock would net a $2,770 option profit &ndash; a nearly identical profit amount with only about one-fifth of the investment!</p><p>Also note that this option contains relatively little time value. The 0.8 points worth of time value (red box) equate to just 0.4% of the underlying stock price. A good way to manage risk when buying call options is to minimize time value and maximize intrinsic value, as time value decays rapidly in the days leading up to option expiration.</p><h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><p>With insurance stocks coming back to the forefront amid ongoing sector rotation, the industry stands to benefit from increased buying pressure. These stocks are often overlooked due to their inherently stable nature.</p><p>A great way to take advantage of this move is via low-risk call options. Assurant is a good candidate for a call option purchase, as the company boasts strong fundamental and technical indicators. This allows us to leverage Assurant stock returns with the power of options<strong>.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2328293/weekly-option-windfall-how-to-play-the-outperforming-insurance-sector?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-know_your_options-2328293">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Is the Options Market Predicting a Spike in Saia (SAIA) Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>Saia, Inc.</strong>&nbsp; SAIA need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 20, 2024 $630.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h2>What is Implied Volatility?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h2>What do the Analysts Think?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Saia shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Saia is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Transportation - Truck industry that ranks in the Bottom 6% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from earnings of $4.11 per share to $3.51 in that period.<br /><br />Given the way analysts feel about Saia right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><h2>Looking to Trade Options?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.<br /><br /><strong>Click to see the trades now &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328353/is-the-options-market-predicting-a-spike-in-saia-saia-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|options-2328353">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Leidos Wins a $51M Deal to Upgrade Missile Capabilities ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Leidos Holdings, Inc.</strong> LDOS recently clinched a contract for Missile Warning/Missile Track Enhancement (MW/MT) from the Space Systems Command, Strategic Warning and Surveillance Systems Acquisition Delta. The value of the award is $51 million.<br /><br />Per the terms of the contract, Leidos will deliver mission software and technology-enabled services to improve missile warning capabilities for the Combatant Commanders&#39; Integrated Command and Control Systems.</p><h2>What&rsquo;s Favoring LDOS?<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Rapidly increasing geopolitical tensions worldwide, along with heightened regional conflicts in different parts of the globe, like the Middle East and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have prompted nations to bolster their defense capabilities.&nbsp; Since missiles constitute a large share of a nation&rsquo;s defense arsenals, countries are investing heftily these days in advanced missile systems for deterrence and defense. This has been boosting the demand for technologically advanced missile systems.<br /><br />The Mordor Intelligence firm predicts the global market for missiles and missile defense systems to witness a CAGR of 5% between 2024 and 2029. Such growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market should bode well for Leidos, which also focuses on integrating cutting-edge technologies to enhance missile performance, reliability and effectiveness.<br /><br />Leidos is a renowned provider of cutting-edge technology, offering the United States access to several medium Earth orbit and low Earth orbit constellations of infrared sensors that can follow and identify the most sophisticated missile threats, from ballistic to hypersonic and tactical to strategic.<br /><br />Such capabilities of LDOS must have enabled the company to win steady orders for its products that support missile warning and threat detection, like the latest one.</p><h2>Peer Prospects<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>As global threats continue to rise, apart from Leidos, defense contractors that are likely to benefit from the growth opportunities offered by the missile and missile defense system market have been discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>The Boeing Company</strong> BA: For almost 25 years, the company has been providing air and missile defense systems to the United States, its allies and international partners. Its offerings include the Avenger Air Defense System and Ground-Based Midcourse Defense.<br /><br />Boeing boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 21.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BA&rsquo;s 2025 sales implies growth of 20.3% from the prior-year projected figure.<br /><br /><strong>Northrop Grumman</strong> NOC: The company develops and manufactures warheads, fuses, advanced high-speed propulsion systems and other missile components. It is a leading supplier of solid rocket propulsion for air-launched missiles, interceptors, submarine-launched weapons and hypersonic missile systems.<br /><br />Northrop has a long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate of 8.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC&rsquo;s 2024 sales suggests growth of 5.4% from the prior-year reported figure.<br /><br /><strong>Lockheed Martin</strong> LMT: The company&rsquo;s Missiles and Fire Control business unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced missiles and rockets. Some of its renowned products are the PAC-3 family of missiles, M270, RRPR and THHAD.<br /><br />Lockheed has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT&rsquo;s 2024 sales implies growth of 5.3% from the prior-year reported figure.</p><h2>Price Movement<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>In the past six months, shares of Leidos have rallied 23.3% compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 1.6%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/19/75704.jpg?v=2113829134" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Zacks Rank<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Leidos currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

<![CDATA[ Analysts Estimate Dave & Buster's (PLAY) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 14:00:06 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Dave & Buster's (PLAY) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.</p><p>The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.</p><p>While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.</p><p><h2>Zacks Consensus Estimate</h2></p><p>This owner of Dave & Buster's, a chain of restaurants and arcades is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.93 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.1%.</p><p>Revenues are expected to be $567.02 million, up 4.6% from the year-ago quarter.</p><p><h2>Estimate Revisions Trend</h2></p><p>The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 26.58% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.</p><p>Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.</p><p><h2>Earnings Whisper</h2></p><p>Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).</p><p>The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.</p><p>Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.</p><p>A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.</p><p>Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).</p><p><h2>How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Dave & Buster's?</h2></p><p>For Dave & Buster's, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -17.20%.</p><p>On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.</p><p>So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Dave & Buster's will beat the consensus EPS estimate.</p><p><h2>Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?</h2></p><p>Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.</p><p>For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Dave & Buster's would post earnings of $1.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.12, delivering a surprise of -28.21%.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.</p><p>That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.</p><p>Dave & Buster's doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.</p><p>Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328295/analysts-estimate-dave-buster-s-play-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_9-2328295">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>America's Car-Mart (CRMT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2024.

<![CDATA[ Wall Street Analysts Think TransAlta (TAC) Could Surge 47.5%: Read This Before Placing a Bet ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:55:09 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><b>TransAlta</b> (TAC) closed the last trading session at $8.99, gaining 22.2% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $13.26 indicates a 47.5% upside potential.</p><p>The average comprises seven short-term price targets ranging from a low of $10.90 to a high of $19.18, with a standard deviation of $3.52. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 21.3% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to an 113.4% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.</p><p>While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.</p><p>However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in TAC. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.</p><p><h2>Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets</h2></p><p>According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.</p><p>While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?</p><p>They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.</p><p>However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.</p><p>That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.</p><p><h2>Why TAC Could Witness a Solid Upside</h2></p><p>There has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.4%, as one estimate has moved higher compared to no negative revision.</p><p>Moreover, TAC currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>></p><p>Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much TAC could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328284/wall-street-analysts-think-transalta-tac-could-surge-47-5-read-this-before-placing-a-bet?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|consensus_price_target-2328284">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Wall Street Analysts See a 27.84% Upside in BeiGene (BGNE): Can the Stock Really Move This High? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:55:08 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <b>BeiGene, Ltd.</b> (BGNE) have gained 28.8% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $202.17, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $258.45 indicates a potential upside of 27.8%.</p><p>The mean estimate comprises 11 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $55.54. While the lowest estimate of $152 indicates a 24.8% decline from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 70.7% to reach $345. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.</p><p>While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.</p><p>But, for BGNE, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.</p><p><h2>Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets</h2></p><p>According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.</p><p>While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?</p><p>They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.</p><p>However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.</p><p>That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.</p><p><h2>Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in BGNE</h2></p><p>There has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 32.2%, as five estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.</p><p>Moreover, BGNE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>></p><p>Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much BGNE could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328285/wall-street-analysts-see-a-27-84-upside-in-beigene-bgne-can-the-stock-really-move-this-high?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|consensus_price_target-2328285">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Sony (SONY) Now Trades Above Golden Cross: Time to Buy? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:55:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Sony Corporation (SONY) is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective, as the company reached a key level of support. Recently, SONY's 50-day simple moving average crossed above its 200-day simple moving average, known as a "golden cross."</p><p>A golden cross is a technical chart pattern that can signify a potential bullish breakout. It's formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average breaking above a longer-term moving average, with the most common moving averages being the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.</p><p>Golden crosses have three key stages that investors look out for. It starts with a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out, followed by the stock's shorter moving average crossing over its longer moving average and triggering a trend reversal. The final stage is when a stock continues the upward climb to higher prices.</p><p>A golden cross contrasts with a death cross, another widely-followed chart pattern that suggests bearish momentum could be on the horizon.</p><p>SONY could be on the verge of a breakout after moving 8.7% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank.</p><p>Once investors consider SONY's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months compared to 1 revisions higher, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased as well.</p><p><img width='100%' height='auto' src='https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/yseop/549/SONY_SMA50_200.jpeg' alt='Moving Average Chart for SONY' title='' class='chart'></p><p>Investors should think about putting SONY on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimates.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328290/sony-sony-now-trades-above-golden-cross-time-to-buy?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|golden_crossover-2328290">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Are Options Traders Betting on a Big Move in Olin (OLN) Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:53:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in&nbsp;<strong>Olin Corporation</strong> OLN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 17, 2024 $25 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is Implied Volatility?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What do the Analysts Think?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Olin shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Olin is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Chemical-Diversified industry that ranks in the Bottom 10% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimate for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.21 per share to three cents per share in that period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the way analysts feel about Olin right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Looking to Trade Options?</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Click to see the trades now &gt;&gt;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328336/are-options-traders-betting-on-a-big-move-in-olin-oln-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|options-2328336">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Patterson Companies, Inc.</strong> PDCO reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 24 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents by 25%. The bottom line also declined 40% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s level.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GAAP EPS in the quarter was 15 cents, down 53.1% from the bottom line recorded in the year-ago period.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PDCO&rsquo;s Revenue Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Net sales in the quarter were $1.54 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8%. The top line declined 2.2% year over year. Internal sales, adjusted for the effects of currency translation and the net impact of an interest rate swap, decreased 2.8% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s figure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of this company were down 8.5% in pre-market trading. The company&rsquo;s shares have lost 9.8% year to date against the industry&#39;s 1.1% growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index has risen 17.9% in the same time frame.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/88/75723.jpg?v=442914425" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Segmental Analysis of PDCO</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company currently distributes products through its subsidiaries, Patterson Dental and Patterson Animal Health.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dental Segment</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This segment provides a complete range of consumable dental products, equipment, software, turnkey digital solutions and value-added services to dentists and laboratories throughout North America.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, dental sales declined 2.8% year over year to $550.4 million. The decline was led by lower Value-added Services sales and the deflationary impact of certain infection control products.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Dental Consumable</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sales in the sub-segment totaled $344.1 million, down 2.3% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s number.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Dental Equipment</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sales in the segment declined 2.7% on a year-over-year basis to $133.9 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Value-added Services and Other</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This segment comprises technical services, parts and labor, software support services and office supplies. Sales declined 6.8% year over year to $72.4 million, primarily driven by the negative impact of the cybersecurity attack on Change Healthcare.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Animal Health Segment</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">This segment is a leading distributor of veterinary supplies to clinics, public and private institutions, and shelters across the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the fiscal first quarter, sales declined 2.8% to $982.4 million from the prior-year period&rsquo;s level.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Corporate</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The segment recorded a gain of $9 million against an expense of $1.5 million in the year-ago quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Margin Analysis</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Gross profit in the reported quarter was $312.6 million, down 2% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, the gross margin of 20.3% expanded approximately 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Operating expenses amounted to $283.2 million, down 0.9% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s figure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reported an operating income of $29.4 million, down 23.2% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Financial Position</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">PDCO exited the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $148.1 million compared with $114.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cumulative net cash used in operating activities at the end of the quarter was $285 million compared with $253.4 million in the prior-year period.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Fiscal 2025 Earnings Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Patterson Companies maintained its earnings guidance for fiscal 2025. The company projects adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.33-$2.43, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.36.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Patterson Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Patterson Companies, Inc.

Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Our Take</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">PDCO ended first-quarter fiscal 2025 on a dismal note, wherein both earnings and revenues missed estimates. Quarterly results reflected the negative impact of a cybersecurity attack on the company&rsquo;s claims processing vendor, Change Healthcare, leading to the inability to utilize insurance claim processing services by many dental practitioners. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Deflationary impact continues to hurt the Dental segment across the Consumables and Equipment categories. The continued negative impact of cybersecurity attacks raises uncertainty for the upcoming quarters.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the weak companion animal market continues to pull down Animal Health sales. Although the company has maintained its EPS guidance for the fiscal year, PDCO&rsquo;s performance is likely to remain weak amid ongoing deflationary and cyber-attack challenges.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PDCO&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Patterson Companies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are <strong>DaVita Inc. </strong>DVA, <strong>Boston Scientific</strong> BSX and <strong>The Cooper Companies</strong> COO.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DaVita, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 17.5%.

<![CDATA[ <p>Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both.</p><p>Featuring daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.</p><p>Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.</p><p>It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>To have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.</p><p>Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Zoom Video Communications (ZM)</h2></p><p>Zoom Video Communications&rsquo; cloud-native unified communications platform, which combines video, audio, phone, screen sharing and chat functionalities, makes remote-working and collaboration easy. Undoubtedly, the company is benefiting from the work-from-home and online learning wave following the coronavirus pandemic outbreak that forced more and more people to stay home.</p><p>ZM is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.</p><p>Momentum investors should take note of this Computer and Technology stock. ZM has a Momentum Style Score of A, and shares are up 17.8% over the past four weeks.</p><p>Nine analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.24 to $5.28 per share. ZM boasts an average earnings surprise of 17.8%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, ZM should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328261/why-zoom-video-communications-zm-is-a-top-momentum-stock-for-the-long-term?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_momentum_score-2328261">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both.</p><p>Featuring daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.</p><p>Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.</p><p>It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>To have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.</p><p>Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: TJX (TJX)</h2></p><p>Based in Framingham, MA, The TJX Companies, Inc. is a leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide. The company&rsquo;s broad range of assortments at varying prices helps it to reach out to a broad range of consumers. In addition to these, The TJX Companies tries to attract consumers through rapid turn of inventories. As of Jul 29, 2023, the company operated a total of around 4,900 stores in nine countries, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Austria, the Netherlands, and Australia, and five e-commerce sites.</p><p>TJX is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.</p><p>Momentum investors should take note of this Retail-Wholesale stock. TJX has a Momentum Style Score of A, and shares are up 6% over the past four weeks.</p><p>Seven analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.02 to $4.15 per share. TJX boasts an average earnings surprise of 4.4%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, TJX should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328267/why-tjx-tjx-is-a-top-momentum-stock-for-the-long-term?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_momentum_score-2328267">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.</p><p>Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Seagate (STX)</h2></p><p>Headquartered at Dublin, Ireland, Seagate is leading provider of data storage technology and infrastructure solutions.

It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.</p><p>It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.</p><p>For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Kimberly-Clark (KMB)</h2></p><p>Incorporated in Delaware in 1928, Kimberly-Clark Corporation is principally engaged in the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of consumer products around the world. The company sells its products to supermarkets; mass merchandisers; drugstores; warehouse clubs; variety and department stores; retail outlets; manufacturing, lodging, office building, food service, and health care establishments; and high volume public facilities.</p><p>KMB is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>Momentum investors should take note of this Consumer Staples stock. KMB has a Momentum Style Score of B, and shares are up 5.3% over the past four weeks.</p><p>Seven analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.19 to $7.25 per share. KMB also boasts an average earnings surprise of 12.6%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, KMB should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328263/why-kimberly-clark-kmb-is-a-top-momentum-stock-for-the-long-term?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_momentum_score-2328263">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>Finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum traders and investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.

That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.</p><p>Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: IdaCorp (IDA)</h2></p><p>Headquartered in Boise, ID, IDACORP, Inc. is a regulated utility formed in 1998.&nbsp; The company is engaged in the transmission, distribution and sale of electricity services in southern Idaho and eastern Oregon through its primary subsidiary Idaho Power Company (Idaho Power).

<![CDATA[ Foot Locker Q2 Loss Narrower Than Expected, Margin View Down ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Foot Locker, Inc. </strong>FL posted second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with both the bottom and top lines surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, revenues were above while earnings were below the year-ago quarter&#39;s level. The company lowered its margin guidance due to heightened promotional pressure.<br /><br />However, in the second quarter, the Lace Up Plan demonstrated its effectiveness by driving a return to positive total and comparable sales growth, along with gross margin expansion. Strong top-line trends were noted as the quarter progressed, including a solid start to Back-to-School and stabilization in the Champs Sports banner.<br /><br />Additionally, the Lace Up Plan continues to unlock significant opportunities by leveraging strong brand partnerships, enhancing in-store experiences and strengthening customer connections through digital and loyalty initiatives. Over the past three months, FL&#39;s shares have risen 42.5% against the industry&rsquo;s 4.5% decline.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Foot Locker, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><h2> <img alt="Foot Locker, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/8a/1724849995.png" title="" width="577" /> </h2><p>Foot Locker, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Foot Locker, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2>More on Foot Locker&rsquo;s Q2 Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The athletic shoes and apparel retailer posted an adjusted loss of 5 cents per share, which is narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of an adjusted loss of 8 cents per share. However, the figure marked a deterioration from the prior-year quarter&#39;s adjusted earnings per share of 4 cents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Total revenues of $1,896 million increased 1.9% from the year-ago period&#39;s figure. Excluding the impacts of foreign-currency fluctuations, total sales increased 2.5%. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,883 million. However, a non-recurring expense related to the launch of the&nbsp; enhanced FLX Rewards Program in the United States decreased sales by $11 million.<br /><br />Comparable sales increased 2.6% year over year, driven by 5.2% comps growth in global Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker sales.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/81/75706.jpg?v=683782015" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Insight Into FL&rsquo;s Margins</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">FL&#39;s gross margin rate increased 50 basis points (bps). Excluding the non-recurring FLX Rewards Program impact, the gross margin improved 90 bps due to its lower markdown levels and occupancy leverage. We expected the gross margin to be flat year over year.<br /><br />The selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 130 bps from the prior-year period&#39;s level. This increase was due to investments in technology and brand-building, along with higher inflation. However, it was partially offset by savings from the cost-optimization program and ongoing expense discipline. We anticipated SG&amp;A expenses to expand 150 bps.</p><h2>Foot Locker&#39;s Q2 Store Update</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the fiscal second quarter, the company inaugurated five stores and closed 31. Additionally, during this period, it remodeled or relocated 14 stores and modernized 67 to adhere to its latest design standards, integrating essential aspects of its current brand specifications.<br /><br />As of Aug. 3, 2024, FL managed 2,464 stores across 26 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Moreover, 213 franchised stores were operational in the Middle East and Asia.</p><h2>FL&rsquo;s Financial Snapshot: Cash, Debt and Equity Overview</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $291 million. Long-term debt and obligations under finance leases amounted to $440 million and shareholders&rsquo; equity totaled $2,897 million. As of Aug. 3, 2024, merchandise inventories were $1,648 million, down 10% from the year-earlier quarter&#39;s figure.</p><h2>What Lies Ahead for Foot Locker?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For fiscal 2024, management expects sales to grow 1% to decline 1%, including a 1% headwind from the lapping of an extra week in 2023. The company expects comps to increase in the band of 1-3% year over year. Licensing revenues are likely to be $17 million.<br /><br />The gross margin is anticipated to be 29.5-29.7% compared with the prior estimated range of 29.8-30% due to promotional pressure in international and WSS. Management expects EBIT margin to be in the band of 2.8-3.2%. The SG&amp;A rate is anticipated to be in the range of 24.1-24.3% compared with the earlier expected 24.4-24.6%, due to ongoing investment spending.<br /><br />Foot Locker envisions adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.50-$1.70.

<![CDATA[ Implied Volatility Surging for AerSale (ASLE) Stock Options ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>AerSale Corporation</strong> ASLE need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 20, 2024 $22.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is Implied Volatility?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What do the Analysts Think?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for AerSale shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, AerSale is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Aerospace-Defense Equipment Industry that ranks in the Top 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimate for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised his estimate downward. The net effect has narrowed our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 15 cents per shareto eight centsper share in that period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the way analysts feel about AerSale right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Looking to Trade Options?</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Click to see the trades now &gt;&gt;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328333/implied-volatility-surging-for-aersale-asle-stock-options?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|options-2328333">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.</p><p>The research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.</p><p>Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Each stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum traders and investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>A proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.</p><p>It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>This totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.</p><p>For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Iridium Communications (IRDM)</h2></p><p>Founded in 2000 and headquartered in McLean, VA, Iridium Communications Inc is a satellite communications company that offers dedicated commercial global voice and data communications services to both businesses and governments in the U.S. as well as globally. It also works with non-governmental organizations.</p><p>IRDM is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. IRDM has a Growth Style Score of B, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 575% for the current fiscal year.</p><p>Three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.07 to $0.81 per share. IRDM boasts an average earnings surprise of 202.2%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, IRDM should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328236/are-you-a-growth-investor-this-1-stock-could-be-the-perfect-pick?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_growth_score-2328236">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

In this regard, acquisitions; partnerships; delivery programs like Walmart + and Express Delivery; and investment in online e-commerce platform Flipkart are noteworthy. These position the company to keep pace with the changing retail ecosystem and stay firm in the presence of rivals like Amazon and Target. Markedly, Walmart&rsquo;s product offerings include almost everything from grocery to cosmetics, electronics to stationery, home furnishings to health and wellness products, and apparel to entertainment products, to name a few.</p><p>WMT is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors.

But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.</p><p>A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Spectrum Brands (SPB)</h2></p><p>Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. is a global consumer products company. It offers a portfolio of leading brands in several product categories like residential locksets, plumbing, electric shaving and grooming products, personal care products, small household appliances, specialty pet supplies, lawn and garden and home pest control products and repellents.</p><p>SPB is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.</p><p>Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. SPB has a Growth Style Score of A, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 212.4% for the current fiscal year.</p><p>Two analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.10 to $4.78 per share. SPB boasts an average earnings surprise of 95.8%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, SPB should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328241/here-s-why-spectrum-brands-spb-is-a-strong-growth-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_growth_score-2328241">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.</p><p>Featuring daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.</p><p>It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>Finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum traders and investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.</p><p>Investors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.</p><p>A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Cloudflare (NET)</h2></p><p>Headquartered in San Francisco, CA, Cloudflare Inc. is a global cloud services provider that delivers a suite of deeply integrated products, including website and application services solutions, <em>Cloudflare One</em>, developer-based solutions and consumer offerings.</p><p>NET is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors.

<![CDATA[ <p>It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.</p><p>The research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.</p><p>Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum investors, who live by the saying "the trend is your friend," are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>A proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.</p><p>It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>To have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.</p><p>Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR)</h2></p><p>Based in Lake Success, NY, Broadridge is a global financial technology company that offers investor communications and technology-driven solutions to banks, broker-dealers, asset managers and corporate issuers. The company is a leading producer and distributor of a variety of documents, widely used in the financial industry including proxies, annual reports, prospectuses and trade confirmations.</p><p>BR is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.</p><p>Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. BR has a Growth Style Score of A, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 10.1% for the current fiscal year.</p><p>For fiscal 2025, three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.12 to $8.51 per share. BR boasts an average earnings surprise of 5.3%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, BR should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328251/why-this-1-growth-stock-could-be-a-great-addition-to-your-portfolio?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_growth_score-2328251">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Equinor Cancels Plan for Vietnam's Offshore Wind Sector ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:43:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Equinor ASA&nbsp;</strong>EQNR, a Norwegian energy firm, has announced its withdrawal from Vietnam&rsquo;s offshore wind sector. The company has scrapped its plan to invest in the offshore wind segment of the Southeast Asian country. This announcement is seen as a major blow to Vietnam&rsquo;s ambitions to reduce the usage of coal and shift to cleaner alternatives.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Vietnam&rsquo;s Renewables Targets and Regulatory Hurdles</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Vietnam has highlighted that it intends to develop wind farms with a capacity of 6 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. Currently, the country does not have any operational offshore wind project. The 6-GW capacity would equal 4% of its planned capacity and help the country achieve its net zero carbon emissions target by 2050.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per a World Bank report, Vietnam has garnered significant international attention toward renewables projects in the country due to strong winds that blow in its shallow waters near the coastal areas. These regions are densely populated as well. However, despite having such favorable conditions, delays in regulatory reforms have caused many potential investors to reconsider their plans.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Equinor&rsquo;s decision to cancel its investment is another major setback for Vietnam. Previously, &Oslash;rsted, a Danish offshore wind firm, also hit a pause on its decision to invest in large offshore wind farms in Vietnam. The recent political climate of the country is causing delays in reforms, leading to hold-up of projects.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Equinor&rsquo;s Strategic Withdrawal</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Equinor has stated that it will end its business development operations in the Southeast Asian country and close its Hanoi office. The company has recently withdrawn its upstream business from several countries to focus more on renewables and low-carbon energy initiatives. However, this is the first time that EQNR closed an international office that was dedicated to renewable energy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">EQNR had conducted a regular review of its portfolio of renewables assets before dissolving its Hanoi office. A company spokesperson said that the offshore wind sector was facing several headwinds and the company needed to pursue a disciplined approach to its investments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When Equinor first opened its office in Hanoi in May 2022, it highlighted Vietnam&rsquo;s potential to become an attractive market for offshore wind. It stated that the country had some of the best wind resources of Asia. However, despite the initial enthusiasm, the company decided to withdraw its operations from the country.</p><h2>EQNR&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, EQNR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the energy&nbsp;sector are&nbsp;<strong>SM Energy</strong> SM, <strong>TechnipFMC plc </strong>FTI and&nbsp;<strong>MPLX LP </strong>MPLX. SM Energy presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while TechnipFMC and MPLX carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. <strong>You can see&nbsp;</strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here<strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">SM Energy is an upstream energy firm operating in the prolific Midland Basin and the South Texas regions. For 2024, the company expects its production to increase from the prior-year reported figure, signaling a bright production outlook.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TechnipFMC is a leading manufacturer and supplier of products, services and fully integrated technology solutions for the energy industry. The company&rsquo;s&nbsp;total backlog witnessed a record high of $13.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, indicating a year-over-year increase of 4.51%. This growing backlog ensures strong revenue growth for FTI in the future.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MPLX LP owns and operates a wide range of midstream assets. The partnership&#39;s midstream assets include oil and natural gas gathering systems and transportation pipelines for crude, natural gas and refined petroleum products. MPLX is least exposed to commodity price fluctuations as it generates stable fee-based revenues. Furthermore, it surpasses its industry peers in terms of distribution yield, reflecting its commitment to returning capital to its unitholders.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328331/equinor-cancels-plan-for-vietnam-s-offshore-wind-sector?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_energy_sector-2328331">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Goldman Sachs Trims Oil View: What's Next for Energy Stocks? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:41:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Goldman Sachs Group</strong> GS has lowered its forecast for oil prices, projecting a range of $70 to $85 per barrel for Brent crude in 2025, with an average price of $77. This adjustment reflects a growing caution in the market, driven by weaker-than-expected Chinese demand, higher U.S. shale production, and stable global inventories. As the energy sector braces for potential headwinds, Goldman&rsquo;s outlook points to several key factors that could influence oil prices and the broader market in the years ahead.<br /><br />While the outlook may appear cautious, the inherent volatility in oil prices could create opportunities for those prepared to navigate the market&#39;s twists and turns. The $75+ level, which Goldman Sachs has forecast as the commodity&rsquo;s average realization next year, is still a healthy enough level for market participants. Therefore, investors interested in the sector could benefit from having quality stocks <strong>SM Energy Company</strong> SM, <strong>TechnipFMC plc</strong> FTI and <strong>Tullow Oil</strong> TUWOY.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Weaker Chinese Demand and Rising U.S. Production</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">A significant factor behind Goldman Sachs&#39; revised forecast is the unexpectedly low demand growth from China, a major engine of global oil consumption. Structural changes in China, including the switch from oil to electricity in transportation and weaker petrochemical demand, have caused the bank to lower its global oil demand growth forecast for 2024 from 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to 0.9 million bpd. The subdued demand growth, coupled with high inventories that have not seen the expected drawdowns, has exerted downward pressure on oil prices.<br /><br />Adding to the bearish sentiment, U.S. shale production has been more robust than anticipated, thanks to efficiency gains. U.S. crude production is now 200,000 barrels per day above Goldman Sachs&#39; earlier estimates, contributing to an oversupply situation. The bank also anticipates that OPEC+ could opt to increase supply strategically, potentially to discipline non-OPEC producers like U.S. shale companies, which could further depress prices.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Supply Dynamics and Potential Surplus</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Goldman Sachs suggests that oil markets may shift from a tight balance to a potential surplus by 2025. This expectation is rooted in the anticipated increase in supply from both OPEC and non-OPEC producers. OPEC+ is expected to begin unwinding its voluntary production cuts by the fourth quarter of 2024, which could lead to a market surplus. Goldman forecasts that if OPEC fully reverses its cuts, Brent crude could fall as low as $61 per barrel. This scenario would intensify competition among producers, potentially leading to lower prices to maintain market share.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Goldman Sachs Vs. Morgan Stanley</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">While both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley foresee a downward trend in oil prices, there are subtle differences in their projections. Morgan Stanley also expects Brent crude prices to decline, forecasting a range of $75 to $78 per barrel by the end of 2025. Morgan Stanley predicts a transition from a tight market to equilibrium by late 2024, with a potential surplus emerging in 2025 due to increased supply from both OPEC and non-OPEC producers. However, Morgan Stanley&#39;s forecast is slightly more optimistic than Goldman Sachs&#39;, particularly regarding the pace and extent of the market rebalancing.<br /><br />Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, is more conservative in its estimates, factoring in multiple downside scenarios. For instance, if demand from China remains flat, Brent could fall to $60 per barrel, a more drastic drop than Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s estimates. This variance in outlook reflects different assumptions about the supply-demand balance, geopolitical risks, and the strategic actions of key producers like OPEC.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Broader Implications for Investors</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Goldman Sachs&#39; revised outlook is a wake-up call for investors in the Oil/Energy sector. The combination of slower Chinese demand, rising U.S. shale production, and the potential for increased OPEC supply suggests a period of volatility and uncertainty ahead. However, this environment could also present opportunities. As oil prices adjust to new market dynamics, there may be openings to invest in energy stocks positioned to benefit from increased efficiency, technological advancements, or diversified portfolios that can weather periods of lower prices.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">3 Energy Stocks to Buy</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Goldman Sachs&#39; latest take on the oil market underscores the complexities facing the energy sector. Investors should remain vigilant, watching for shifts in supply-demand dynamics, geopolitical developments, and strategic decisions by major producers.<br /><br />Amid the uncertainty, it is necessary that investors adopt a cautious approach. It is prudent to opt for stocks that have enough room for upside. While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, this is where the Zacks Rank, which justifies a company&rsquo;s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy.<br /><br />We recommend accumulating stocks like SM Energy, TechnipFMC and Tullow Oil. SM Energy currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while TechnipFMC and Tullow carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each.<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>SM Energy Company:</strong> SM beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters. The independent oil and gas exploration and production company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11.9% on average.<br /><br />SM is valued at around $5.2 billion. SM Energy has seen its shares increase 11.5% in a year.<br /><br /><strong>TechnipFMC:</strong> The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings of Sunoco indicates 197.8% growth.<br /><br />The leading oilfield equipment supplier is valued at around $11.4 billion. TechnipFMC has seen its stock surge 43.5% in a year.<br /><br /><strong>Tullow Oil:</strong> TUWOY is valued at some $555.2 million. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has increased 8.3%.<br /><br />Tullow Oil enjoys a Value and Growth Score of A and B, respectively, each helping it round out with a VGM Score of A.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abbott Laboratories </strong>ABT recently announced the expansion of its Pure Blissby Similacline of organic and European-made infant formulas. This line offers parents a variety of products to meet specific formula preferences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expansion of Pure Bliss&#39; line of products highlights Abbott&rsquo;s motive to invest in clinical research and product development to advance nutrition science for babies of all ages.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">About Abbott&rsquo;s Pure Bliss Line</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Pure Bliss by Similac offers a range of organic or European-made infant formulas that provide gentle, complete nutrition and specifically sourced ingredients. It offers exclusively sourced milk from Ireland. These formulas are backed by high-quality, complete infant nutrition inspired by breast milk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Pure Bliss line includes Pure Bliss Irish Farms infant formula, which offers complete nutrition that&#39;s easy to digest. Pure Bliss&nbsp;Organic and Pure Bliss Organic with A2 Milk infant formulas, both USDA-certified, are now part of Pure Bliss by Similac. Organic with A2 Milk infant formula uses milk from select cows that produce A2 beta-casein protein, which is easy to digest and more like the protein found in breast milk.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">More on Abbott&rsquo;s Pure Bliss</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Pure Bliss by Similac infant formula products are available on Amazon, Target and Walmart.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the availability of Pure Bliss formulas, Similac, backed by Abbott, can provide even more choices for families worldwide.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Prospects Favor ABT</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per a Zion Market Research report, the global infant formula market size was valued at $70.98 billion in 2022 and is&nbsp;predicted to grow to around $153.26 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.10% during the period.

The integration of Abbott&#39;s CGM sensor with Medtronic&#39;s automated insulin delivery (AID) algorithms will enable automatic adjustments of insulin to keep glucose in range.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Price Performance of ABT</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of ABT have risen 8.9% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s 9.2% growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ABT&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ABT currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are <strong>Intuitive Surgical</strong> ISRG, <strong>TransMedics Group </strong>TMDX and <strong>Boston Scientific </strong>BSX.

The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured, and the sectors are listed from best to worst.</p><p>The Zacks Rank is a successful stock-picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks. Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.</p><p>Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.</p><p>Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's "Value" category. Stocks with both "A" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.</p><p>One company value investors might notice is <b>Barrett Business Services (BBSI)</b>. BBSI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 16.81 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 24.45. BBSI's Forward P/E has been as high as 17.39 and as low as 12.10, with a median of 15.03, all within the past year.</p><p>We also note that BBSI holds a PEG ratio of 1.12. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. BBSI's industry currently sports an average PEG of 2.64. BBSI's PEG has been as high as 1.24 and as low as 0.86, with a median of 1.07, all within the past year.</p><p>We should also highlight that BBSI has a P/B ratio of 4.70. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 13.02. Within the past 52 weeks, BBSI's P/B has been as high as 4.82 and as low as 3.20, with a median of 4.07.</p><p>Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. BBSI has a P/S ratio of 0.86. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.</p><p>These are only a few of the key metrics included in Barrett Business Services's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, BBSI looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328206/are-investors-undervaluing-barrett-business-services-bbsi-right-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_2-2328206">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Should Value Investors Buy UGI (UGI) Stock? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.</p><p>Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.</p><p>Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the "Value" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, "A" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.</p><p>One company value investors might notice is <b>UGI (UGI)</b>. UGI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 7.95, which compares to its industry's average of 14.61. Over the past 52 weeks, UGI's Forward P/E has been as high as 8.76 and as low as 6.25, with a median of 7.92.</p><p>We also note that UGI holds a PEG ratio of 1.04. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. UGI's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.42. UGI's PEG has been as high as 1.10 and as low as 0.78, with a median of 0.99, all within the past year.</p><p>We should also highlight that UGI has a P/B ratio of 1.11. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 1.19. UGI's P/B has been as high as 1.26 and as low as 0.99, with a median of 1.11, over the past year.</p><p>Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. UGI has a P/S ratio of 0.71. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.74.</p><p>Finally, our model also underscores that UGI has a P/CF ratio of 4.25. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. UGI's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 7.75. Over the past year, UGI's P/CF has been as high as 7.51 and as low as -24.88, with a median of 4.24.</p><p>Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that UGI is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, UGI sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328205/should-value-investors-buy-ugi-ugi-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_2-2328205">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Should Value Investors Buy Heritage Insurance (HRTG) Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.</p><p>Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.</p><p>In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's "Value" category. Stocks with "A" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.</p><p><b>Heritage Insurance (HRTG)</b> is a stock many investors are watching right now. HRTG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value.</p><p>Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. HRTG has a P/S ratio of 0.63. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.21.</p><p>Finally, investors will want to recognize that HRTG has a P/CF ratio of 7.69. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 11.64. HRTG's P/CF has been as high as 7.69 and as low as -41.09, with a median of 4.42, all within the past year.</p><p>These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Heritage Insurance is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, HRTG feels like a great value stock at the moment.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328203/should-value-investors-buy-heritage-insurance-hrtg-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_2-2328203">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.</p><p>The research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.</p><p>It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum investors, who live by the saying "the trend is your friend," are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.</p><p>It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>To have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.</p><p>Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Cheesecake Factory (CAKE)</h2></p><p>As of Jul 2, 2024, Cheesecake Factory owned and operated 340 restaurants throughout the United States and Canada under brands, including The Cheesecake Factory and North Italia, Flower Child and a collection within the Fox Restaurant Concepts subsidiary.</p><p>CAKE is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>It also boasts a Value Style Score of A thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 12.63; value investors should take notice.</p><p>For fiscal 2024, 11 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.05 to $3.21 per share. CAKE boasts an average earnings surprise of 6.5%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, CAKE should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328210/are-you-a-value-investor-this-1-stock-could-be-the-perfect-pick?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_value_score-2328210">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

THC also boasts an average earnings surprise of 58.5%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, THC should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328207/why-tenet-healthcare-thc-is-a-top-value-stock-for-the-long-term?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_value_score-2328207">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The Computer and Technology group has plenty of great stocks, but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers.

<![CDATA[ <p>For those looking to find strong Industrial Products stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers.

The Zacks Sector Rank includes 16 different groups and is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.</p><p>The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months.

<![CDATA[ <p>While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.</p><p>Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.</p><p>On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the "Value" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and "A" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.</p><p>One company value investors might notice is <b>Assurant (AIZ)</b>. AIZ is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value grade of A.</p><p>Another valuation metric that we should highlight is AIZ's P/B ratio of 2. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 2.70. Over the past 12 months, AIZ's P/B has been as high as 2.06 and as low as 1.63, with a median of 1.84.</p><p>Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. AIZ has a P/S ratio of 0.87. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.01.</p><p>These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Assurant is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, AIZ feels like a great value stock at the moment.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328218/are-investors-undervaluing-assurant-aiz-right-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_2-2328218">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Here at Zacks, we focus on our proven ranking system, which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, to find winning stocks. But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.</p><p>Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.</p><p>Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's "Value" category. Stocks with both "A" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.</p><p>One company to watch right now is <b>StoneX Group (SNEX)</b>. SNEX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 10.97, while its industry has an average P/E of 13.90. Over the past year, SNEX's Forward P/E has been as high as 11.33 and as low as 8.32, with a median of 9.41.</p><p>We should also highlight that SNEX has a P/B ratio of 1.60. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. SNEX's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.45. Over the past 12 months, SNEX's P/B has been as high as 1.67 and as low as 1.31, with a median of 1.46.</p><p>Finally, investors will want to recognize that SNEX has a P/CF ratio of 7.40. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. SNEX's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 14.02. SNEX's P/CF has been as high as 7.59 and as low as 5.34, with a median of 6.37, all within the past year.</p><p>These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that StoneX Group is likely being undervalued right now.

<![CDATA[ <p>Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.</p><p>Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.</p><p>On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the "Value" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and "A" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.</p><p>One company to watch right now is <b>PCB Bancorp (PCB)</b>. PCB is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 10.57 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 13.97. Over the past year, PCB's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.02 and as low as 7.62, with a median of 9.20.</p><p>Another notable valuation metric for PCB is its P/B ratio of 1.13. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 1.95. Within the past 52 weeks, PCB's P/B has been as high as 1.19 and as low as 0.74, with a median of 0.82.</p><p>Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. PCB has a P/S ratio of 1.49. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.91.</p><p>Finally, we should also recognize that PCB has a P/CF ratio of 9.59. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. PCB's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 16.55. PCB's P/CF has been as high as 10.09 and as low as 5.69, with a median of 7.12, all within the past year.</p><p>Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that PCB Bancorp is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, PCB sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328214/is-pcb-bancorp-pcb-a-great-value-stock-right-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_2-2328214">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.</p><p>The research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.</p><p>Zacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>Developed alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Each stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>Finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>Growth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum traders and investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.</p><p>It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>This totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.</p><p>A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: PulteGroup (PHM)</h2></p><p>Based in Atlanta, GA, PulteGroup Inc. engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company conducts operations through two primary business segments &ndash; Homebuilding (which contributed 98% as of 2023 to total revenues) and Financial Services (2%).</p><p>PHM is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>It also boasts a Value Style Score of A thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 9.85; value investors should take notice.</p><p>For fiscal 2024, six analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.51 to $13.36 per share. PHM boasts an average earnings surprise of 10%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, PHM should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328223/here-s-why-pultegroup-phm-is-a-strong-value-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_value_score-2328223">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.</p><p>Featuring daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.</p><p>Zacks Premium also includes the Zacks Style Scores.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.</p><p>It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>This totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>To have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.</p><p>Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: First Solar (FSLR)</h2></p><p>Headquartered in Tempe, AZ, First Solar, Inc. is the world&rsquo;s largest thin-film PV solar module manufacturer and the largest PV solar module manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere. The company is a leading global provider of comprehensive photovoltaic (PV) solar energy solutions and specializes in designing, manufacturing, and selling solar electric power modules using a proprietary thin-film semiconductor technology. The company sells its products to project developers, system integrators and renewable energy project operators primarily in Europe and Germany in particular. First Solar also engages in designing and deploying commercial solar projects for utilities. The company also develops and sells PV solar power systems that primarily use the modules it manufactures. Additionally, it provides operations and maintenance (&ldquo;O&amp;M&rdquo;) services to system owners.</p><p>FSLR is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>It also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 17.33; value investors should take notice.</p><p>For fiscal 2024, four analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0 to $13.58 per share. FSLR boasts an average earnings surprise of 14.8%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, FSLR should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328219/are-you-a-value-investor-this-1-stock-could-be-the-perfect-pick?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_value_score-2328219">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Is Standard Chartered (SCBFF) Stock Undervalued Right Now? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:40:10 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Here at Zacks, we focus on our proven ranking system, which places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, to find winning stocks. But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.</p><p>Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.</p><p>Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the "Value" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, "A" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.</p><p>One stock to keep an eye on is <b>Standard Chartered (SCBFF)</b>. SCBFF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 5.16 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 8.84. Over the last 12 months, SCBFF's Forward P/E has been as high as 6.99 and as low as 4.22, with a median of 5.17.</p><p>Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. SCBFF has a P/S ratio of 0.62. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.16.</p><p>Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Standard Chartered is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, SCBFF sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328230/is-standard-chartered-scbff-stock-undervalued-right-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_2-2328230">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Telefonica Gains 12% in 6 Months: Should Investors Buy TEF Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Telef&oacute;nica, S.A.</strong> TEF stock has risen 12% in the past six months, outperforming the sub-industry and S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s growth of 2.7% and 10.7%, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TEF&rsquo;s stock has outperformed some of its peers in the industry in the past six months. While <strong>TELUS Corporation </strong>TU and <strong>BCE Inc</strong> BCE shares have dropped 7.4% and 5.1%, respectively, shares of <strong>Deutsche Telekom A</strong>G DTEGY have moved up 19.2%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ab/75685.jpg?v=964523100" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Improving financial performance is behind the stock price surge. Telefonica reported a 1.2% year-on-year revenue increase in the second quarter of 2024. The top-line growth was driven by the robust performance in both B2B and B2C segments. TEF&rsquo;s main markets, including Spain, Germany and Brazil, witnessed positive commercial momentum, underscoring the company&rsquo;s effective market positioning and customer-centric strategies.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/75/75689.jpg?v=725942150" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Network Expansion, Partnerships Augur Well for TEF</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Telefonica expanded its fiber-to-the-home footprint by an additional 2 million premises in the second quarter, reaching 66% of population coverage across core markets. TEF achieved more than 90% 5G coverage in Spain and Germany. This enhances service quality and customer satisfaction. These initiatives are crucial for sustaining long-term growth and competitive advantage.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Telefonica has made considerable strides in its strategic initiatives and regional operations during the first half of the year. The strategic nonbinding MOU signed with Vodafone in Spain for creation of a FibreCo highlights its hands-on approach to market optimization and network rationalization. It also signed an MOU with Medico in Colombia for a possible corporate transaction of its operations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Telefonica reached an agreement with ANATEL / Ministry of Communication on fixed voice concession to authorization model migration. It signed a mobile network sharing agreement with Vodafone U.K., which extends beyond 2030.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>Telefonica Remains Focused on Driving Profitability</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Operational efficiencies from Spain&#39;s network restructuring and legacy network decommissioning significantly reduced operating expenses, contributing to higher EBITDA growth. Telefonica&#39;s focus on leaner operations and capital efficiency bolsters its financial performance and free cash flow generation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the second quarter, EBITDAaL minus CapEx surged by 11.5% year over year, positioning Telefonica well above its full-year guidance trajectory. This growth was supported by a disciplined capital expenditure approach, with a CapEx-to-sales ratio of 12.1%, highlighting efficient operational management.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Driven by progress in the first half, management remains confident about achieving its financial outlook for full-year 2024. TEF continues to expect revenues to grow approximately 1%. EBITDA is expected to rise 1% to 2%. The CapEx-to-sales ratio is likely to be up to 13%.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>TEF Faces Competition and Forex Volatility Concerns</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Intense competition in telecom services across Europe and Latin America could lead to margin compression. Maintaining competitive pricing amid rising operational costs and regulatory demands poses a challenge to sustaining profitability.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The impact of weaker foreign exchange rates remains a concern. Fluctuations in FX rates could potentially mitigate future growth projections, affecting overall financial performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The macroeconomic uncertainty has contributed to the depreciation of Latin American currencies versus the euro. Telefonica classified its operations across Latin America (excluding Brazil) as non-core, given the challenging market conditions across these markets and their declining contribution to revenues and profitability in recent years.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>Telefonica&rsquo;s Debt-Laden Balance Sheet</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Telefonica has a debt-laden balance sheet. As of June 30, 2024, the company had &euro;5,268 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with &euro;7,337 million at the end of the previous quarter. As of June 30, 2024, TEF had &euro;33,813 million of non-current financial liabilities compared with &euro;33,978 million at the end of the previous quarter. Although the company is striving to bring down its debt through modified financial strategies, accumulating debt may pose a problem for its credit ratings.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>TEF&rsquo;s Estimate Revision Activity</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For Telefonica, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has remained unchanged for the current quarter, while it has increased by 2 cents for the next quarter in the past 60 days. The current quarter estimate stands at 8 cents, while the next quarter&rsquo;s estimate is pegged at 9 cents.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a4/75687.jpg?v=505438882" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Telefonica: A Value-Driven Choice</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">TEF presents a compelling investment opportunity with its attractive forward 12-month price-to- earnings ratio of 13.31, lower than the industry average of 16.69 observed over the past five years.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Its forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio positions Telefonica as a value-driven choice with significant upside potential. TEF is currently trading at a nearly 4.8% discount to its 52-week high of $4.80, reached on June 4, 2024.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/0c/75686.jpg?v=1287769725" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>To Conclude</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Telefonica is well-positioned to capitalize on market opportunities driven by its strategic investments in network expansion and operational efficiency. However, competitive pressures, forex volatility amid dynamic market conditions remain concerns for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Consequently, it might not be a prudent investment decision to bet on the TEF stock at the moment. However, investors already owning the stock could stay put.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see<strong> the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328233/telefonica-gains-12-in-6-months-should-investors-buy-tef-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2328233">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Down -24.41% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why You Should You Buy the Dip in Vasta Platform (VSTA) ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><b>Vasta Platform Limited</b> (VSTA) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 24.4% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.</p><p><h2>Here is How to Spot Oversold Stocks</h2></p><p>We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.</p><p>RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.</p><p>Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.</p><p>So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.</p><p>However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.</p><p><h2>Here's Why VSTA Could Experience a Turnaround</h2></p><p>The RSI reading of 22.89 for VSTA is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.</p><p>The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for VSTA has increased 303.3%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.</p><p>Moreover, VSTA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

<![CDATA[ MGM Resorts Stock Drops 15% YTD: Is It the Right Time to Buy? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>MGM Resorts International </strong>MGM are struggling to stay afloat in the stock market. Despite strong second-quarter results, the stock has dropped 15% year to date compared with the industry&rsquo;s 6.8% rise and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 17.9% increase. Investor sentiments remain tepid primarily due to broader market volatility and uncertainties in Macau.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, MGM&#39;s stock has shown some relative strength compared with competitors like <strong>Wynn Resorts, Limited</strong> WYNN. down 15.5%, <strong>Las Vegas Sands Corp.</strong> LVS, down 18.9%, and <strong>Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment Limited</strong> MLCO, down 39.1.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3d/75681.jpg?v=2099337872" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">MGM is currently trading at a discount to the industry, with a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.81, well below the industry average of 27.84X. The stock is also trading at a 21.2% discount to its 52-week high of $48.25, which might attract value-focused investors. But is now the right time to buy MGM? Let&rsquo;s explore.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/16/75678.jpg?v=9324221" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Understanding MGM&rsquo;s Challenges</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Macau&#39;s Market Stability is Questionable:</strong> MGM China&rsquo;s strong performance is promising, but the market&rsquo;s recovery to just 80% of pre-pandemic levels leaves room for uncertainty. Although MGM outperformed competitors in Macau, the region continues to be highly volatile. Regulatory shifts, competitive pressures and potential changes in consumer demand could all impact future profitability, making it a risky bet for long-term investors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Las Vegas Growth May Face Headwinds:</strong> While MGM reported revenue growth in its Las Vegas operations, the upcoming months could bring challenges. The anticipated strength in hotel bookings and group business is offset by potential headwinds, such as the softness surrounding the Formula One event. This event was initially expected to be a significant boost, but early signs indicate it may not live up to expectations. Although the company successfully integrated Marriott into its operations, the long-term impact on margins and occupancy remains uncertain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>High Exposure to Luxury Investments:</strong> MGM&rsquo;s heavy investment in luxury resorts raises concerns. The company allocated 75% of its 2024 domestic capital budget toward its Strip luxury properties. While luxury offerings can be profitable, this focus on a niche market makes MGM highly vulnerable to shifts in consumer behavior, especially if economic conditions worsen.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MGM Valuations That May Deter Investor Confidence</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share (EPS) declined from $2.96 to $2.75 in the past 60 days. During the same period, the consensus mark for 2025 EPS declined from $3.19 to $3.08.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/93/75676.jpg?v=153849801" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><br /><p>Technical indicators do not support MGM. As of Tuesday, MGM is trading at $38.01, below its 50-day moving average of $41.3 and the 200-day moving average of $42.2. The crossover of the 50-day moving average below the 200-day moving average warrants caution in regard to avoiding the stock.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1a/75675.jpg?v=1384317792" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Positive Aspects of MGM</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">MGM has been advancing its digital strategy, which has become a cornerstone of its growth initiatives. The company&rsquo;s digital arm, BetMGM, turned profitable in the second quarter, driven largely by its iGaming business, which generates approximately $400 million annually. Recent acquisitions of LeoVegas and Push Gaming have bolstered MGM&rsquo;s technology ownership and enhanced its proprietary content, giving it a competitive advantage in the digital arena.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MGM&rsquo;s digital portfolio has been further strengthened through partnerships and acquisitions, including the introduction of a Live Dealer product with Playtech and the acquisition of Tipico&rsquo;s U.S. sports betting platform. The rollout of a unified account and wallet system in Nevada is expected to boost customer engagement and support MGM&rsquo;s omnichannel strategy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the global front, MGM&rsquo;s expansion is picking up momentum. The company is confident in its limited license projects in New York, Japan and the UAE, which are anticipated to contribute to future cash flows. Potential ventures in Thailand highlight MGM&rsquo;s commitment to expanding its geographic presence and diversifying revenue streams.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MGM&rsquo;s long-term strategy is centered on capitalizing on growth opportunities while maintaining a shareholder-friendly approach. Management projected a mid-teens compound annual growth rate in free cash flow per share through 2028, underscoring confidence in its growth trajectory.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Investment Thought: Hold or Buy?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Given current conditions, holding MGM Resorts stock seems to be a prudent approach for existing investors. While the stock is trading at a favorable valuation, ongoing uncertainties in Macau, challenges in Las Vegas and a heavy focus on luxury investments suggest exercising caution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although MGM&rsquo;s digital growth and global expansion efforts are encouraging, short-term challenges and technical indicators do not currently support new buying. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock allows investors to potentially benefit from long-term growth without taking on additional risks in the current volatile environment. New investments in MGM may be better considered once the uncertainties stabilize.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328327/mgm-resorts-stock-drops-15-ytd-is-it-the-right-time-to-buy?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2328327">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Implied Volatility Surging for CVB Financial (CVBF) Stock Options ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>CVB Financial Corp. </strong>CVBF need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep. 20, 2024 $5 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h2>What is Implied Volatility?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h2>What do the Analysts Think?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for CVB Financial shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, CVB Financial is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Banks - West industry that ranks in the Top 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 36 cents per share to 35 cents in that period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the way analysts feel about CVB Financial right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><h2>Looking to Trade Options?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Click to see the trades now &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328160/implied-volatility-surging-for-cvb-financial-cvbf-stock-options?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|options-2328160">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Here's Why Retain Strategy is Apt for Phillips 66 Stock Now ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Phillips 66&rsquo;s </strong>PSX shares have surged 23.2% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s 11.7% rise.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&#39;s Favoring the Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">PSX boasts a diversified business model, with substantial involvement in refining midstream, chemicals and marketing &amp; specialties. Across all its operations, Phillips 66 maintains a strong presence in terms of safety, profitability, scale and competitive advantages.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company is prioritizing segments such as midstream, renewables and chemicals, enhancing the stability of its business model. With a U.S. pipeline network spanning 72,000 miles, Phillips 66 anticipates that nearly 80% of its midstream contracts will be fee-based, indicating a resilient business model with minimal susceptibility to fluctuations in commodity prices.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Phillips 66, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has a strong focus on returning capital to shareholders. Since July 2022, the company has returned a massive $11.2 billion through both dividends and share repurchases. By the end of this year, it expects to meet its target of returning $13 billion to $15 billion to shareholders. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Risks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Phillips 66&rsquo;s refining business is exposed to extreme volatility in commodity prices since the end products are made with raw crude oil. Rising input costs hurt the company&rsquo;s refining business. Also, with new refinery capacities coming online, PSX will likely see a depressed refining margin in the coming quarters.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other companies that have refining businesses and are likely to get exposed to volatility in oil prices are <strong>Marathon Petroleum Corp.</strong> MPC, <strong>Valero Energy Corporation</strong> VLO and <strong>Exxon Mobil Corporation</strong> XOM.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Marathon Petroleum, with its extensive refining operations, manages the largest refining system in the United States. Valero Energy boasts a combined daily throughput capacity of roughly 3.2 million barrels, with its 15 refineries spreading across the United States, Canada and the U.K.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ExxonMobil also has a strong footing in the global refining business, having roughly 5 million barrels per day of distillation capacity across its 21 refineries.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328326/here-s-why-retain-strategy-is-apt-for-phillips-66-stock-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2328326">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Is High Tide (HITI) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:30:12 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?</p><p>Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about <b>High Tide Inc.</b> (HITI) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.</p><p>High Tide currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by four brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.00 indicates Strong Buy.</p><p>Of the four recommendations that derive the current ABR, four are Strong Buy, representing 100% of all recommendations.</p><p><h2>Brokerage Recommendation Trends for HITI</h2></p><p><img width='100%' src='https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/yesopchart/brokerage_bar/HITI_08282024.png' alt='Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for HITI' title='' class='chart'><br/><br/>Check price target & stock forecast for High Tide here>>><br/><br/>The ABR suggests buying High Tide, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.</p><p>Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five "Strong Buy" recommendations for every "Strong Sell" recommendation.</p><p>In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.</p><p>With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.</p><p><h2>ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.</p><p>Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.</p><p>It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.</p><p>On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year.

<![CDATA[ <p>The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?</p><p>Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about <b>PulteGroup</b> (PHM).</p><p>PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.94, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.94 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.</p><p>Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and one is Buy.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.</p><p>Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every "Strong Sell" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five "Strong Buy" recommendations.</p><p>This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement.

Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.</p><p><h2>Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR</h2></p><p>Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.</p><p>Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.</p><p>It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.</p><p>On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.</p><p>There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness.

<![CDATA[ <p>When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?</p><p>Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about <b>General Motors</b> (GM).</p><p>General Motors currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.91, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.91 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.</p><p>Of the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60.9% and 4.4% of all recommendations.</p><p><h2>Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GM</h2></p><p><img width='100%' src='https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/yesopchart/brokerage_bar/GM_08282024.png' alt='Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GM' title='' class='chart'><br/><br/>Check price target & stock forecast for General Motors here>>><br/><br/>While the ABR calls for buying General Motors, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.</p><p>Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five "Strong Buy" recommendations for every "Strong Sell" recommendation.</p><p>This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement.

Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.</p><p><h2>Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR</h2></p><p>Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.</p><p>Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28).

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sony Group Corporation</strong> SONY recently announced a 19% price increase for its PlayStation 5 (PS5) console in Japan, highlighting a challenging external environment (including fluctuations in the global economy) as the primary reason. Beginning Sept 2., 2024, the PS5 will cost &yen;79,980 for the standard edition and &yen;72,980 for the digital edition. &nbsp;<br /><br />PS5 was initially launched in November 2020. The price hike comes when the PS5 is expected to be succeeded by a revamped version shortly.&nbsp;<br /><br />The company also hiked prices for its accessories, including the DualSense wireless controller and Pulse Elite wireless headset, with the changes set to take effect from Sept. 2, 2024.<br /><br />After the announcement, Sony&rsquo;s stock gained 3.5% on Aug. 27 and closed trading at $96.07, underscoring positive market reception to the price hike.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Sony Corporation Price and Consensus</h3><h2> <img alt="Sony Corporation Price and Consensus" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/68/1724850947.png" title="" width="574" /> </h2><p>Sony Corporation price-consensus-chart | Sony Corporation Quote</p></div><h2>SONY Stock Up 14% Since Earnings</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">SONY&rsquo;s stock has gained 13.6% since it announced better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug. 7.&nbsp;<br /><br />Its revenues rose 2% year over year to &yen;3,011.6 billion while net income per share (on a GAAP basis) of &yen;189.43 ($1.22) per share increased from &yen;175.67 reported in the year-ago quarter. Improved performance of the Game &amp; Network Services (G&amp;NS) segment, which is the largest contributor to its sales, was the primary growth driver.&nbsp;<br /><br />G&amp;NS sales jumped 12% year over year to &yen;864.9 billion, owing to higher sales from network services, notably PlayStation Plus, and rising sales of non-first-party titles along with favorable forex impacts.&nbsp;<br /><br />In June 2024, active user accounts of PlayStation were a record 116 million. The company plans to boost the G&amp;NS segment by expanding the stable installed base of PlayStation consoles, enhancing gaming experiences and growing its business by expanding into PCs and improving the first-party software titles. Sony has updated its outlook for the G&amp;NS segment. It now expects sales to be &yen;4,320 billion, up from the prior view of &yen;4,200 billion, owing to the positive impacts of forex rates.<br /><br />Shares of SONY have gained 17.1% compared with the sub-industry&#39;s growth of 13% in the past year.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/11/75727.jpg?v=651770947" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>SONY&rsquo;s Zacks Rank</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">At present, SONY carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><h2>Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks from the broader technology space are <strong>Arista Networks, Inc.</strong> ANET, <strong>Harmonic Inc</strong>.

<![CDATA[ Morgan Stanley Gains 9.5% YTD: Will Rate Cuts Boost MS Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:28:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>One of the most well-known global investment banks, <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> MS, is generating a lot of interest among investors. The company&rsquo;s shares have gained 9.5% so far this year.&nbsp;<br /><br />The stock is trading well below its peers &ndash; <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> GS and <strong>JPMorgan </strong>JPM. Also, it compares unfavorably with the industry and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>YTD Price Performance</strong><br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/80/75719.jpg?v=1344864410" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The recent weakness in Morgan Stanley shares can be attributed to the subdued performance of the wealth management business in the second quarter of 2024. The Wealth Management segment, which generates almost 50% of the company&rsquo;s net revenues, failed to deliver as expected. The segment&rsquo;s revenues declined 1% sequentially, while net income was stable. Also, net new assets in the Wealth Management segment decreased 62% from the prior quarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />Morgan Stanley, under its new CEO Ted Pick, has been trying to focus less on capital markets-driven revenues. So, the weak performance of the wealth management operation is concerning. Nonetheless, the recent statement by the Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on interest rate cuts is likely to turn around Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s investment banking business.&nbsp;<br /><br />MS witnessed a solid resurgence in advisory and underwriting businesses in the second quarter on the back of robust deal-making and underwriting activities. These activities have been weak since 2022, given the higher interest rates and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop.<br /><br />As the path for the Fed&rsquo;s rate cuts is clear and the U.S. economy is on solid footing, an increase in deal value and volume will likely continue in the quarters ahead.&nbsp;<br /><br />Almost two weeks ago, the MS stock crossed the 50-day simple moving average, indicating robust upward momentum and price stability. This underscores positive market sentiments and confidence in the company&#39;s financial health and prospects.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>50-Day Moving Average</strong><br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/dc/75716.jpg?v=93484984" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s stock price breaking out, investors face a crucial decision: should they buy, hold or sell the shares now?</p><h2>Bullish Analyst Sentiments for MS</h2><p>Analysts seem to be bullish about Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s prospects. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 and 2025 earnings has moved upward.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Estimate Revision Trend</strong><br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a6/75718.jpg?v=1610572223" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This upward adjustment reflects a positive sentiment among analysts and suggests encouraging prospects. Further, over the long term, the company&rsquo;s earnings are expected to grow 13.9%.</p><h2>Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s Compelling Valuation</h2><p>MS stock is trading at a discount, with a 12-month trailing price-to-tangible book (P/TB) of 2.37X compared with the industry&rsquo;s 5.02X and higher than the median of 2.06X.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Price-To-Tangible Book TTM</strong><br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f0/75720.jpg?v=1155043331" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Goldman and JPMorgan are trading at 1.6X and 2.53X of 12-month trailing P/TB.</p><h2>How to Play the Morgan Stanley Stock?</h2><p>While Morgan Stanley stock is trying to break out, caution is warranted for prospective investors. The company&rsquo;s global presence, rebound in the investment banking business and efforts to focus on less volatile revenue streams provide a solid base for organic growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />MS also continues to reward shareholders handsomely. As it cleared the 2024 stress test, the company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend by 8.8% to 92.5 cents per share. In the last five years, it increased dividends four times, with an annualized growth rate of 28.1%. It also reauthorized a new multi-year share repurchase program of up to $20 billion, effective the third quarter of 2024.<br /><br />However, challenges like high rates, the expected economic downturn and the tough macroeconomic backdrop cannot be ignored. Investors need to keep a watch on the company&rsquo;s wealth management business.<br /><br />Hence, current stakeholders should maintain their position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Potential new investors might consider waiting for more clarity on how MS navigates the broader economic landscape before making new investment decisions.

<![CDATA[ Is the Options Market Predicting a Spike in Hanesbrands (HBI) Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:26:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors in <strong>Hanesbrands Inc. </strong>HBI need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct. 18, 2024 $10 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.</p><h2>What is Implied Volatility?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.</p><h2>What do the Analysts Think?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Hanesbrands shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Hanesbrands is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Textile - Apparel industry that ranks in the Bottom 35% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 26 cents per share to 12 cents in that period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the way analysts feel about Hanesbrands right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there&rsquo;s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.</p><h2>Looking to Trade Options?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Click to see the trades now &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328145/is-the-options-market-predicting-a-spike-in-hanesbrands-hbi-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|options-2328145">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <strong>Bank of Montreal</strong> BMO declined 6.2% on the NYSE in response to weak third-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended July 31) results. Adjusted earnings per share of C$2.64 declined 10.2% year over year.<br /><br />A significant jump in provision for credit losses and lower net interest income (NII) primarily hurt the results. However, an increase in non-interest income, higher loans and deposit balance and lower expenses acted as a tailwind.<br /><br />After considering non-recurring items, net income was C$1.87 billion ($1.37 billion), which grew 19.2% from the year-ago quarter.</p><h2>BMO&rsquo;s Revenues Rise, Expenses Dip</h2><p>Total revenues (on an adjusted basis), net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB), were C$8.21 billion ($5.99 billion), up marginally year over year.<br /><br />NII declined 2% year over year to C$4.81 billion ($3.51 billion). On the other hand, non-interest income came in at C$3.4 billion ($2.48 billion), up 3.4%.<br /><br />Adjusted non-interest expenses decreased 5% to C$4.7 billion ($3.43 billion).<br /><br />The adjusted efficiency ratio (net of CCPB) was 57.3%, down from 60.3% as of July 31, 2023.<br /><br />Provision for credit losses (adjusted) was C$906 million ($515.5 million) in the reported quarter, surging 84.1% from the year-ago quarter.</p><h2>Loans &amp; Deposits Rise for Bank of Montreal</h2><p>As of July 31, 2024, total assets were C$1.4 trillion ($1 trillion), up 1.9% from the prior quarter end.<br /><br />Bank of Montreal&rsquo;s total net loans grew 2.5% sequentially to C$673.2 billion ($486.9 billion). Total deposits increased 3% to C$965.2 billion ($698.1 billion).</p><h2>BMO&rsquo;s Profitability Ratios Decline, Capital Ratios Improve</h2><p>Bank of Montreal&rsquo;s return on common equity (as adjusted) was 10.6% in the fiscal third quarter compared with 12.5% on July 31, 2023. Adjusted return on tangible common equity was 14.2% compared with 17.1% in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />As of July 31, 2024, the Common Equity Tier-I ratio was 13%, up from 12.3% a year ago. The Tier-I capital ratio was 14.8% compared with the previous year&rsquo;s 14%.</p><h2>Our Take on BMO</h2><p>Bank of Montreal&rsquo;s focus and efforts align with its organic and business restructuring strategies and are anticipated to support revenues in the upcoming period. However, elevated expenses and an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop are headwinds.<br />&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Bank Of Montreal Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Bank Of Montreal Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/59/1724849830.png" title="" width="584" /> <p>Bank Of Montreal price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Bank Of Montreal Quote</p></div><p>Currently, BMO carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Performance &amp; Earnings Date Other Canadian Banks</h2><p><strong>Toronto-Dominion Bank</strong> TD incurred a loss on a GAAP basis in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended July 31). The quarterly loss was primarily due to provisions for the penalties related to investigations concerning its anti-money laundering practices by the U.S. regulators.<br /><br />Net loss (GAAP basis) was C$181 million ($132.2 million) against net income of $2.88 billion in the prior-year quarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />Huge increases in provisions for credit losses and higher expenses acted as undermining factors. On the other hand, growth in NII and non-interest income and higher loan balance offered much-needed support to TD&rsquo;s quarterly performance.<br /><br /><strong>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</strong> CM is slated to announce quarterly numbers on Aug. 29.<br /><br />Over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CM&rsquo;s quarterly earnings has been revised marginally lower.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328317/bank-of-montreal-stock-tanks-6-2-as-high-provisions-hurt-q3-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_article-2328317">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Buoyed by a holistic growth model, <strong>Nokia Corporation</strong> NOK is currently trading at $4.22, close to its 52-week high of $4.225. The stock has gained 19.6% over the past six months compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 19.1%, outperforming peers like <strong>Comtech Telecommunications Corp.</strong> CMTL but lagging <strong>Ericsson</strong> ERIC.<br /><br />Nokia is well-positioned for the ongoing technology cycle, given the strength of its end-to-end portfolio. The company&rsquo;s deal win rate is encouraging with notable successes in the key 5G markets of the United States and China.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6b/75698.jpg?v=1470634992" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>NOK&rsquo;s Value Creation Journey, Strategic Focus</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Nokia has made significant progress on its three-phased journey of value creation: Reset, Accelerate and Scale. Its focus on capital allocation and technology leadership is expected to help it grow profitably. Nokia is on track to achieve sustainable, profitable growth and technology leadership by accelerating its product roadmap and cost competitiveness through additional 5G investments. The 5G portfolio is gaining traction among enterprise customers. Nokia currently has 319 commercial 5G deals with communications service providers globally. It has 110 live 5G networks, both public and private.&nbsp;<br /><br />Nokia is also focused on its strategy, which hinges on four priorities. The first priority is to lead in high-performance end-to-end networks with its communications service provider customers. The second one is the relentless pursuit to expand network sales to select vertical markets, specifically energy, transportation, public sector, technical extra-large enterprises and webscale players such as Google and Amazon. Building a strong standalone software business is the third priority. The fourth one is to create new business and licensing opportunities in the consumer ecosystem.</p><h2>Key Growth Drivers for NOK Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">To strengthen its leading position in the market, Nokia facilitates its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations by offering easy programmability and flexible automation needed to support dynamic operations, reduce complexity and improve efficiency. The company seeks to expand its business into targeted, high-growth and high-margin vertical markets to address growth opportunities beyond its traditional primary markets.<br /><br />Its installed base of high-capacity AirScale products, which enables customers to quickly upgrade to 5G, is growing fast. The company is driving the transition of global enterprises into smart virtual networks by creating a single network for all services, converging mobile and fixed broadband, IP routing and optical networks with the software and services to manage them. Leveraging state-of-the-art technology, Nokia is transforming the way people and things communicate and connect. These include a seamless transition to 5G technology, ultra-broadband access, IP and Software Defined Networking, cloud applications and the Internet of Things.</p><h2>Nokia Offering O-RAN With Commercial 5G Cloud-RAN Networks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Nokia is poised to benefit from copper and fiber deployments of passive optical networking. It is reportedly the only global supplier offering Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) with commercial 5G Cloud-RAN networks. The company intends to accelerate strategy execution, sharpen customer focus and reduce long-term costs. At the same time, it is focused on building a strong scalable software business and expand it to structurally attractive enterprise adjacencies. Nokia&rsquo;s C-Band portfolio supports 5G standalone and non-standalone networks, cloud-based implementations and O-RAN products.</p><h2>Margin Pressure: A Major Headwind for NOK</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Nokia&#39;s Mobile Networks business is facing intensifying competition in some accounts as rivals seek to take share in the early stage of 5G. Some of its customers have re-evaluated their vendors in light of security concerns, creating near-term pressure for the company. <strong>AT&amp;T Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s T decision to replace Nokia with a single vendor in the form of Ericsson is expected to hurt net sales.&nbsp;<br /><br />A slowdown of 5G deployments in India is another headwind. Owing to the challenging market situation, the company has reduced its operating margin target for fiscal 2026. Nokia&rsquo;s plan to improve its research and development (R&amp;D) productivity and reduce support function costs is dependent on the successful execution of its cost-saving program.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d1/75700.jpg?v=2081980694" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Softness in Key End Markets of Nokia</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite improvement in the demand environment, weakness in several regions, including the Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, have hurt sales in the Network Infrastructure segment. In addition, the market recovery in the optical networks&rsquo; vertical continues to be slower than the rest of the Network Infrastructure businesses.</p><h2>Estimate Revision Trend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Earnings estimates for Nokia for 2024 have moved down 23.4% to 36 cents over the past year, while the same for 2025 has declined 35.2% to 35 cents. The negative estimate revision depicts bearish sentiments for the stock.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/0d/75701.jpg?v=1419845589" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>End Note</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Nokia has emerged as one of the leading players in the development of advanced 5G technology and is at the forefront of extending 5G use cases in various industries. It has laid a strong foundation of innovation through substantial infrastructure investments. This has led to the establishment of an impressive portfolio comprising approximately 20,000 patent families, including more than 6,000 patent families that are deemed crucial to 5G technology.<br /><br />However, stiff competition and softness in key end markets are likely to put pressure on the bottom-line growth. The downtrend in estimate revisions further portrays skepticism about the stock&rsquo;s growth potential. High R&amp;D costs eroded its profitability to a large extent. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Nokia appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they trade with caution.

<![CDATA[ Toyota & BMW to Solidify Partnership to Expedite FCV Development ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Toyota Motor Corporation</strong> TM and <strong>BMW AG </strong>BMWYY are set to deepen their collaboration on fuel cell vehicles (FCV) to boost the competitiveness of their hydrogen-powered cars.&nbsp;<br /><br />Per Nikkei Asia, under this expanded partnership, which is expected to be officially announced on Sept. 5, 2024, Toyota will supply essential components like hydrogen tanks and fuel cell systems to BMW, which will then manufacture and sell mass-produced FCVs over the next few years.<br /><br />Toyota and BMW originally teamed up on FCV development in 2012 to create greener vehicles amid stricter environmental regulations. Hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles produce only water as emissions and don&#39;t face the range anxiety associated with battery electric vehicles (BEVs). They also refuel as quickly as traditional internal-combustion-engine vehicles. However, FCVs are currently expensive to produce, resulting in low profit margins, and require hydrogen storage at extremely low temperatures. The expanded partnership aims to standardize components and reduce the cost of FCVs, which have struggled to gain popularity due to affordability issues.&nbsp;<br /><br />Toyota, a leader in FCV technology, launched the world&#39;s first mass-produced FCV, the Mirai, in 2014. However, due to the high price of the model of more than 7 million yen compared with the average car price in Japan of 2.64 million yen in 2023, TM sold only about 26,000 units since then, making a small fraction of the company&rsquo;s total annual sales of more than 10 million vehicles.&nbsp;<br /><br />Per WardsAuto, BMW has developed a concept FCV, the iX5 Hydrogen, which features two hydrogen tanks and offers a range of more than 310 miles, with a refueling time of just 3-4 minutes. Incorporating Toyota&rsquo;s fuel cell system could help BMW accelerate the iX5 Hydrogen&rsquo;s production timeline. Despite the potential of FCVs, they have not yet achieved widespread success, mainly due to the scarcity of hydrogen refueling stations. The expanded alliance is also expected to focus on the development of hydrogen infrastructure in Europe. Per the European Automobile Manufacturers&#39; Association, there are currently only 270 hydrogen filling stations, much less than 632,000 public BEV charging stations in the European Union as of the end of 2023.</p><h2>Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">TM &amp; BMWYY currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.<br /><br />Some better-ranked stocks in the auto space are <strong>Dorman Products, Inc.</strong> DORM and <strong>Douglas Dynamics, Inc. </strong>PLOW, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for DORM&rsquo;s 2024 sales and earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 3.71% and 35.46%, respectively. EPS estimates for 2024 and 2025 have improved 51 cents and 37 cents, respectively, in the past 30 days.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLOW&rsquo;s 2024 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 60.4%. EPS estimates for 2024 have improved 15 cents in the past 30 days.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328316/toyota-bmw-to-solidify-partnership-to-expedite-fcv-development?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_corporate_actions-2328316">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Wall Street closed slightly higher on Tuesday, led by tech stocks. Investors remained hopeful that upcoming economic data releases would broaden the path to interest rate cuts. Two of the three most widely followed indexes closed the session in the green, while one remained virtually unchanged.</span></span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">How Did the Benchmarks Perform?</span></span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 9.98 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 41,250.50. Fifteen components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while the other 15 ended in negative.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 29.06 points, or 0.2%, to close at 17,754.82.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The S&amp;P 500 gained 8.96 points, or 0.2%, to close at 5,625.80. Seven of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the green. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) increased 0.6%, 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively, while the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) declined 0.8%.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 4.5% to 15.43. A total of 8.6 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 11.9 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.1-to-1 ratio on the S&amp;P 500.</span></span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Investors Await NVIDIA Earnings and PCE Report</span></span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The focus continues to be on NVIDIA Corporation&rsquo;s NVDA upcoming quarterly earnings call. After sliding more than 2% on Monday, the chipmaking giant&rsquo;s shares recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.5% and carrying the tech sector with it.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">There continue to be some worries that anything short of an outstanding outlook from the company&rsquo;s Wednesday quarterly earnings release can weigh on its fortunes. The size of the company and its pre-eminence in the topic of AI optimism since the beginning of 2023 ensures that market participants will look forward to NVDA&rsquo;s earnings.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Investors also have their eyes set on the Friday release of the Fed&rsquo;s favorite inflation metric, the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) index for July. The central bank recently sent clear signals that it is on the verge of a series of interest rate cuts. The optimism surrounding the Fed&rsquo;s anticipated monetary policy moves helped the markets recover somewhat from the previous session&rsquo;s woes.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Shares of QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM and Booking Holdings Inc. BKNG gained 2.6% and 2.2%, respectively. Both currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&#39;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong></span></span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Economic Data</span></span></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Per S&amp;P Global data, Case-Shiller home prices for 10 City-Composite increased 0.6% in June after rising 1.1% in May. The index for 20 City-Composite also increased 0.6% in June compared with 1% growth in May.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The Conference Board reported that Consumer Confidence for August came in at 103.3 against the consensus of 101 for the period. The number for July was revised up to 101.9 from the previously reported 100.3.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328143/stock-market-news-for-aug-28-2024?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-market_news-2328143">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ PSEG Stock Rides on Investments Despite Weak Financial Position ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:21:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Public Service Enterprise Group, Inc.</strong> PEG or PSEG&rsquo;s focus on renewable generation expansion is likely to bolster its footprint in the clean energy market. To enhance customer reliability, the company makes consistent investments in its infrastructure, strengthening its transmission and distribution system&#39;s resilience.<br /><br />However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company faces risks like an unfavorable financial position and expenditure to remediate every manufactured gas plant (MGP) site, which acts as a headwind.</p><h2>PEG&rsquo;s Tailwinds</h2><p><br />PSEG has a capital investment plan of $18-$21 billion for 2024-2028 to constantly upgrade its infrastructure and expand its renewable generation portfolio. Its solid capital investment plan is estimated to bring in compounded annual rate base growth of 6-7.5% between 2024 and 2028.<br /><br />In the clean energy space, the company is investing significantly in solar initiatives in utility-owned solar photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected systems. As of Dec. 31, 2023, the PSE&amp;G segment owned 158 MW DC of installed PV solar capacity throughout New Jersey.<br /><br />PSEG is also expanding its footprint in the wind energy market. It is essential to note that the company has been granted various onshore transmission contracts by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to link customers with the offshore wind farms that are currently under development.</p><h2>Headwinds Faced by PSEG</h2><p><br />PSEG&rsquo;s segment, PSE&amp;G, has been collaborating with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to assess and remediate environmental conditions at its former MGP sites. As of June 30, 2024, 38 sites require remedial action, and PSE&amp;G estimates costs of $196-$215 million to complete all sites. Such an expenditure might hurt PSEG&rsquo;s operating results.<br /><br />As of June 30, 2024, the company owed $18.42 billion in long-term debt. Its cash balance of $0.11 billion at the end of the second quarter fell short of its long-term debt levels and the current debt value of $2.98 billion. This shows that PSEG has a weak solvency position.</p><h2>PEG Stock Price Movement</h2><p><br />In the past six months, shares of PEG have risen 28.7% compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 20.8%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fa/75670.jpg?v=354682259" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Stocks to Consider</h2><p><br />Some better-ranked stocks from the same industry are <strong>DTE Energy Company </strong>DTE, <strong>The AES Corporation </strong>AES and <strong>NiSource Inc.</strong> NI, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />DTE Energy&rsquo;s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 8.1%. The company delivered an average earnings surprise of 0.77% in the last four quarters.<br /><br />AES delivered an average earnings surprise of 19.18% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AES&rsquo; 2024 sales suggests an improvement of 3.6% from the prior-year reported figure.<br /><br />NiSource&rsquo;s long-term earnings growth rate is 6%. The company delivered an average earnings surprise of 20.64% in the last four quarters.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328140/pseg-stock-rides-on-investments-despite-weak-financial-position?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|zer_report_update-2328140">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Central Garden &amp; Pet Company</strong> CENT has faced a sharp decline in its stock price, dropping 10.6% over the past three months. This stark contrast to the industry&rsquo;s growth of 13.9% signals underlying challenges for the company.&nbsp;<br /><br />This Walnut Creek, CA-based company is grappling with significant challenges that have hurt its financial results. This was reflected in its third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein both revenues and earnings declined year over year. The company&#39;s difficulties are rooted in its core Pet and Garden segments.<br /><br />The company generated net sales of $996.3 million, which came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,008 million. The metric declined 2.6% from the year-ago period. Organic net sales decreased 3%. Adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share dropped from the year-ago period&rsquo;s earnings of $1.40 per share.<br /><br />Following Central Garden &amp; Pet Company&rsquo;s soft performance, analysts have revised their earnings estimates downward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS) has decreased over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for the current and next fiscal year EPS has declined by 5.4% and 2.4% to $2.11 and $2.42 per share, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/be/75664.jpg?v=488218212" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s Hurting CENT Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Central Garden &amp; Pet has faced external pressures such as unfavorable weather conditions and a softer consumer spending environment. The Garden segment, which saw a 6% sales decline during the third quarter, was affected by adverse weather conditions. The cold and wet weather in April and May, followed by record heat in June, severely impacted the sell-through of live plants, a critical category for Central Garden &amp; Pet. The segment&#39;s performance was also affected by the sale of the independent garden channel distribution business, which represented about 5% of Garden segment sales.<br /><br />During the third quarter, the company reported lower foot traffic in its largest home center customers compared to the prior year and pre-COVID-19 levels. This decline in foot traffic is concerning as it directly affects sales volumes, particularly in the Garden segment. The reduced customer visits to key retail partners could lead to lower product turnover, increased inventory levels and the need for discounting to clear stock, all of which would negatively impact margins.<br /><br />We note that the continued weakness in the durable pet products business and softness in new pet adoptions also contributed to the overall decline in the top line. The Pet segment&rsquo;s organic net sales decreased 2.2% in the third quarter. The ongoing pressure in this category, despite growth in consumable pet products, suggests that the company may struggle in the Pet segment. We foresee sales from the Pet segment to decline 5.6% in the final quarter of the current fiscal.<br /><br />Central Garden &amp; Pet continues to estimate fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings to be $2.00 per share or better. The projection suggests uncertain consumer demand, shifting retailer dynamics, and ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Investor Guidance for CENT Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Central Garden &amp; Pet Company have struggled on the bourses of late, underperforming the industry. The dismal performance traces to macroeconomic pressures impacting consumer discretionary spending. These challenges were evident in third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, marked by a decline in revenues and earnings.<br /><br />CENT faces headwinds in its Pet and Garden segments, compounded by external factors. To navigate the challenging environment, management is advancing with its cost and simplicity program as well as investing in capacity expansion and automation. We believe these endeavors will reap benefits over time. For now, existing investors should tread cautiously and evaluate whether to hold or adjust their positions in this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Don&rsquo;t Miss These Solid Bets</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Chefs&#39; Warehouse</strong> CHEF is a premier distributor of specialty food products in the United States, the Middle East and Canada. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). CHEF has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 33.7%, on average. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chefs&#39; current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of around 9.7% and 12.6%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.<br /><br /><strong>Sprouts Farmers</strong> SFM, which is engaged in the retailing of fresh, natural and organic food products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. SFM has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12%, on average.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprouts Farmers&rsquo; current financial-year sales and earnings implies growth of around 9.6% and 18.7%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.<br /><br /><strong>Vital Farms</strong> VITL offers pasture-raised products in the United States. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). VITL has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 82.5%, on average.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vital Farms&rsquo; current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of around 26.3% and 88.1%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328132/cent-stock-declines-11-in-3-months-should-you-buy-hold-or-sell?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2328132">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Willis Towers Stock Rises 38.8% in a Year: More Room for Growth? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:15:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company&rsquo;</strong>s WTW shares have rallied 38.8% in a year compared with the industry&#39;s growth of 17.1%. The Finance sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 index have returned 26.5% and 24.8% in the said time frame, respectively. With a market capitalization of $29.25 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.4 million.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>WTW Outperforms Industry, Sector, S&amp;P 500</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b0/75658.jpg?v=1805038242" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The rally was driven by new business, strategic acquisitions, geographic diversification, solid customer retention levels and a strong capital position, along with solid growth projections.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">WTW Witnessing Northbound Estimate Revision</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Willis Towers&rsquo; 2024 and 2025 earnings has moved 1.4% and 1.5% north, respectively, in the past 60 days, reflecting analyst optimism.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">WTW&rsquo;s Growth Projection Encourages</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Willis Towers&rsquo; 2024 earnings per share indicates a year-over-year increase of 13.9%. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $9.94 billion, implying a year-over-year improvement of 4.8%.<br />&nbsp;<br />The consensus estimate for 2025 earnings per share and revenues indicates a year-over-year increase of 12.4% and 5%, respectively, from the corresponding 2024 estimates. The long-term earnings growth rate is currently pegged at 11.7%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Acting in Favor of WTW</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Willis Towers&rsquo; growth strategy encompasses a focus on improving operating margins, increasing free cash flow conversion and driving sustainable revenue growth. Focus on core opportunities with the highest growth and return, which include gaining market share in Risk and Broking and Individual Marketplace, should spur long-term growth and return more value to shareholders.<br /><br />Well-performing Health, Wealth &amp; Career and Risk &amp; Broking segments, driven by solid customer retention levels, growing new business and geographic diversification, continue to fuel the top line. Most of the company&#39;s operating regions experienced revenue growth for 15 straight quarters.&nbsp;<br /><br />Strategic acquisitions have expanded its geographical footprint in the last few years in countries like Italy, Canada, the U.K. and France, as well as ramped up its product portfolio.<br /><br />This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects to deliver revenues of more than $9.9 billion. Based on the strong first-half performance, WTW has raised the low end of 2024 adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS target to 23-23.5% and $16-$17, respectively.&nbsp;<br /><br />Solid operational performance ensures smooth cash flow. WTW continues to expect a year-over-year improvement in free cash flow margin in 2024</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Distribution of Wealth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Banking on its capital position, WTW distributes wealth to shareholders in the form of dividend hikes and share repurchases. Its dividend has witnessed a five-year CAGR (2019-2024) of 6.2%. Willis Towers&rsquo; dividend yield is currently pegged at 1.2%, which is above the industry average of 1%. The insurer continues to expect share repurchases to total approximately $750 million in 2024, subject to market conditions and other relevant factors.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Risks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the upside potential, Willis Towers&rsquo; expenses have been rising over the last several quarters. Higher salary expenses, incentive costs, improved non-income-related tax expenses and marketing costs, higher restructuring costs, as well as increased consulting and compensation costs related to the Transformation program result in the contraction of margins.<br /><br />Both return on equity and return on invested capital of this insurance broker compared unfavorably with the industry average, reflecting inefficiency in utilizing shareholders&#39; funds to generate returns.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the brokerage insurance industry may look at some better-ranked players like <strong>Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc</strong>. MMC, <strong>Brown &amp; Brown, Inc.</strong> BRO and <strong>Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co</strong>. AJG, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marsh &amp; McLennan&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 9.3% and 7.9%, respectively. MMC beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 5.80%. In the past year, shares of MMC have gained 15.1%.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Brown &amp; Brown&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 30.9% and 8.6%, respectively. It beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 9.8%. In the past year, shares of BRO have jumped 39.7%.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Arthur J. Gallagher&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 15.9% and 12%, respectively. It beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 1.93%. In the past year, shares of AJG have climbed 25.7%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328309/willis-towers-stock-rises-38-8-in-a-year-more-room-for-growth?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|price_surge_/_plunge-2328309">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Domino's Stock Falls 18% in 3 Months: Should You Buy the Dip? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>Domino&#39;s Pizza, Inc.</strong> DPZ have disappointed investors in the past three months, underperforming the S&amp;P 500 and its Industry. The company&rsquo;s struggle in international markets for opening and closing stores and high costs has significantly dented the stock.<br /><br />In the past three months, Domino&#39;s stock has declined by 18% against the industry&rsquo;s 7.1% rise. In sharp contrast, the S&amp;P 500 increased 6.2% during the same period. As of Aug 27, the stock closed at $418.41, significantly below its 52-week high of $542.75 but above its 52-week low of $330.05. The company also underperformed other industry players like <strong>McDonald&#39;s Corporation</strong> MCD, up 16.1%, <strong>Yum! Brands, Inc.</strong> YUM, down 0.1%, and <strong>Starbucks Corporation</strong> SBUX, up 28.3%, in the past three months.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9e/75696.jpg?v=1828265193" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>What&rsquo;s Hurting DPZ?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Domino&#39;s faced a notable setback in its international markets during the recent quarter, with global net new units significantly underperforming the company&#39;s and analysts&#39; expectations. This underperformance was mainly caused by slower net growth in Japan and France, regions managed by one of Domino&#39;s key master franchisees.<br /><br />DPZ had set its international unit targets based on agreements with its master franchisees, but the company observed that the number of new store openings and closures during the quarter diverged significantly from plans discussed after the first quarter. This unexpected decline raises concerns about the transparency and reliability of Domino&#39;s planning process. As a result, the company decided to suspend its guidance on future unit growth.<br /><br />Inflationary pressures in commodity and labor costs continue to hurt the company. The industry players expect to witness higher costs for quite some time due to labor shortages. It has been witnessing labor challenges in a handful of markets. During second-quarter fiscal 2024, the general and administrative expenses (as a percentage of revenues) expanded 100 basis points to 10.5% year over year, driven by higher labor costs and expenses for the company&rsquo;s Worldwide Rally that takes place every two years.<br /><br />The company anticipates a high inflationary environment for food and labor to persist for some time. For the third and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the company expects supply chain margins to be roughly flat and down, respectively, year over year, factoring in an inflationary food basket for the rest of the year, with a full-year range of up 1-3%.</p><h2>Can DPZ Bounce Back?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Although the company&rsquo;s near-term stock performance is disappointing, the new loyalty program, menu innovation and the Hungry for MORE strategy bode well.<br /><br />The company is benefiting from the Hungry for MORE strategy, which primarily focuses on generating MORE sales, MORE stores and MORE profits. The strategic imperatives of this strategy include showcasing the most delicious food (M), driving operational excellence (O), delivering renowned value (R) and engaging best-in-class franchisees (E).<br /><br />The company is also benefiting from its partnership with Uber to drive sales. For the first six months of fiscal 2024, its same-store sales largely benefited from the sales mix from Uber, which grew to 1.4% in the first quarter and 1.9% in the second quarter. DPZ is optimistic about the incrementality of Uber sales throughout the fiscal 2024. The company expects the U.S. comps to be more than 3% in the fiscal 2024, with the third and the fourth quarter&rsquo;s comp expectations being 3% or above. Uber sales are expected to grow on the back of accretive marketing and increasing awareness, with Domino&rsquo;s expecting to finish the fiscal 2024 with an overall sales mix of 3% or more.<br /><br />Domino&rsquo;s consistently focuses on diversifying its menu offerings through innovation to reach peak customer satisfaction and expand its market position. During the fiscal second quarter, the company newly launched the New York-Style pizza, which it intends to permanently keep on the menu. This menu offering is said to be outside the deliciousness idea of the prior Domino&#39;s Pizza Offerings. This innovation aims to increase sales and enhance flavor with unique toppings. The company&rsquo;s Mix &amp; Match offer includes a thin crust option and Domino&#39;s Rewards members can redeem 60 points for a free medium two-topping New York-style pizza. This move demonstrates Domino&rsquo;s&rsquo; commitment to value and customer loyalty.</p><h2>Estimate Movement &amp; Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Estimates for DPZ&rsquo;s 2024 earnings have moved up from $16.00 to $16.23 in the past 60 days. The company&rsquo;s earnings and sales in 2024 are expected to witness growth of 10.7% and 7.3%, respectively, year over year.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/91/75695.jpg?v=1357325474" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The stock is trading at 24.16 times forward earnings, which is slightly lower than the industry average of 24.51 and below its one-year median of 26.46.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d8/75699.jpg?v=1371937326" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Buy, Sell, or Hold &ndash; DPZ</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite Domino&#39;s recent stock decline, there are compelling reasons for existing investors to hold onto their shares. Domino&#39;s commitment to innovation, such as the introduction of the New York-Style pizza, demonstrates its focus on customer satisfaction and market expansion. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company&#39;s earnings estimates for 2024 have also been revised upward, indicating potential growth despite current headwinds.<br /><br />For new investors, it may be wise to wait for more stability in the company&rsquo;s international operations and for inflationary pressures to ease before making a fresh investment. The current challenges and uncertainties suggest that there could be better entry points in the future as DPZ&#39;s works to overcome its recent obstacles.<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328306/domino-s-stock-falls-18-in-3-months-should-you-buy-the-dip?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2328306">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Xcel Energy Inc.</strong> XEL is engaged primarily in the utility business. Its capital investment plan for infrastructure strengthening and clean energy generation is likely to boost its performance. Given its growth opportunities, XEL makes for a solid investment option in the Utility sector.<br /><br />The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Let&rsquo;s look at the factors that are driving the stock.</p><h2>Growth Projections &amp; Surprise History of XEL</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 and 2025 earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $3.55 and $3.84, respectively, which indicates year-over-year growth of 6% and 8%.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for 2024 and 2025 sales is pegged at $14.51 billion and $15.41 billion, respectively, which indicates year-over-year growth of 2.2% and 6.2%.</p><p>XEL&rsquo;s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 6.40%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 0.67% in the past four quarters.</p><h2>XEL Stock&rsquo;s Dividend Yield</h2><p>XEL distributes dividends to its shareholders on a regular basis. It has a target dividend payout ratio of 50-60% and aims to increase shareholder value through 5-7% annual dividend hike. The company has increased its dividends for 21 consecutive years, as of February 2024. Its current dividend yield is 3.6%, which is better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s average of 1.26%.</p><h2>XEL Stock&rsquo;s Return on Equity</h2><p>XEL&rsquo;s current return on equity (ROE) is 10.95%, which is more than the industry average of 10.34%. ROE, a profitable measure, reflects how effectively a company is utilizing its shareholders&rsquo; funds in its operations to generate income.</p><h2>Solvency of XEL Stock</h2><p>XEL&rsquo;s time-to-interest earned ratio at the end of the second quarter was 2.6. The ratio, being greater than one, reflects its ability to meet future interest obligations without difficulties.</p><h2>XEL&rsquo;s Investments &amp; Customer Additions</h2><p>Xcel Energy is investing substantially in its utility assets to provide reliable services to its customers and effectively meet rising electricity demand. It aims to spend $39 billion during the 2024-2028 period. These investments are aimed at strengthening and expanding its transmission, distribution, electric generation and renewable projects.<br /><br />XEL&rsquo;s high quality and reliable services help it to serve an expanding electric and natural gas customer base. The residential electric and natural gas bills of customers in the company&#39;s operating regions are lower than the national average, which attracts new customers. In the second quarter of 2024, XEL&rsquo;s electric customer base increased 1.2% and the natural gas customer base improved 1%.</p><h2>XEL Stock Performance</h2><p>Shares of XEL have risen 15.4% in the past three months compared with the industry&rsquo;s 5.9% growth.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/57/75693.jpg?v=1200405454" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Other Stocks to Consider</h2><p>Some other top-ranked stocks in the same industry are <strong>The AES Corporation</strong> AES, <strong>TransAlta Corporation</strong> TAC and <strong>NiSource Inc.</strong> NI, each currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see <strong>the complete list of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />AES delivered an average earnings surprise of 19.18% in the trailing four quarters.

The consensus estimate for TAC&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has increased 1.4% in the past 30 days.<br /><br />NiSource delivered an average earnings surprise of 20.64% in the past four quarters.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ambarella</strong> AMBA shares were trading more than 20% higher during the pre-market session today as the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. It reported a non-GAAP loss of 13 cents per share for the quarter, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 19 cents.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The bottom-line result also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s non-GAAP loss of 15 cents per share. The improvement was due to higher revenues and prudent expense management actions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Second-quarter revenues of $63.7 million grew 2.6% year over year and 17% sequentially. The top line surpassed the consensus mark of $62.2 million. The robust sequential growth was driven by an improvement in both Auto and IoT segment revenues with robust growth in the edge AI division.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Ambarella, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><h2> <img alt="Ambarella, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/96/1724846060.png" style="width: 610px; height: 279px;" title="" /> </h2><p>Ambarella, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ambarella, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2>AMBA&rsquo;s Q2 Customer &amp; Market Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Ambarella had two logistics and original design manufacturers customers that contributed more than 10% to total revenues in the reported quarter. WT Microelectronics, a partner in Taiwan that serves multiple customers in Asia, accounted for 63% of the company&rsquo;s second quarter revenues. Hakuto, which serves as a distributor in Japan, represented 10% of AMBA&rsquo;s second-quarter revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The traction in AMBA&rsquo;s CV flow system-on-a-chip in professional IP cameras continued in the reported quarter. The company expects the CV2 family to be the key driver of the company&rsquo;s revenue growth in fiscal 2025.</p><h2>Ambarella&rsquo;s Q2 Operating Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The non-GAAP gross margin was 63.3%, down 130 basis points year over year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $47.7 million, up from $46 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses were also within the company&rsquo;s guidance range of $47.5-$49.5 million due to its expense management actions and the timing of spending between quarters.</p><h2>Balance Sheet of AMBA</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As of July 31, 2024, Ambarella had cash and cash equivalents &amp; marketable securities of $219.8 million compared with $203.3 million as of April 30, 2024.</p><h2>Q3 2025 Guidance for Ambarella</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Based on recent customer feedback and continued momentum in bookings, Ambarella expects stability in near-term revenues. It forecasts third-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues between $77 million and $81 million, with sequential growth in IoT and Auto segments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the fiscal third quarter, the non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated in the band of 62.5-64.0%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are projected in the range of $49-$51 million.</p><h2>Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Ambarella currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of AMBA have lost 13.9% year to date (YTD).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are <strong>Aspen Technology</strong> AZPN, <strong>Celestica</strong> CLS and <strong>Arista Networks</strong> ANET, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus mark for Aspen&rsquo;s 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 70 cents to $7.43 per share over the past 30 days, indicating a 12.8% year-over-year increase. It has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 13.1%. The stock has lost 2.7% YTD.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Celestica&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 33 cents to $3.65 per share in the past 30 days, suggesting year-over-year growth of 50.2%.

<![CDATA[ Vistra Corp. (VST) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 13:00:17 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><b>Vistra Corp.</b> (VST) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.</p><p>Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +22.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, which Vistra falls in, has gained 5.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?</p><p>Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.</p><p><h2>Earnings Estimate Revisions</h2></p><p>Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.</p><p>We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>Vistra is expected to post earnings of $1.82 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +45.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -28.9%.</p><p>The consensus earnings estimate of $4.86 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +35.4%. This estimate has changed -2.6% over the last 30 days.</p><p>For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.86 indicates a change of +41.1% from what Vistra is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +10.6%.</p><p>With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Vistra.</p><p>The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:</p><p><h2>12 Month EPS</h2></p><p><h2>Projected Revenue Growth</h2></p><p>Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.</p><p>For Vistra, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.27 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +28.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $16.81 billion and $18.84 billion estimates indicate +13.7% and +12.1% changes, respectively.</p><p><h2>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</h2></p><p>Vistra reported revenues of $3.85 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.6%. EPS of $0.90 for the same period compares with $1.03 a year ago.</p><p>Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -4.84%. The EPS surprise was -43.4%.</p><p>The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.</p><p><h2>Valuation</h2></p><p>No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation.

<![CDATA[ NIO Inc. (NIO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><b>NIO Inc.</b> (NIO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.</p><p>Shares of this company have returned -9.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. The Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry, to which NIO belongs, has lost 2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?</p><p>While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.</p><p><h2>Revisions to Earnings Estimates</h2></p><p>Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.</p><p>Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.</p><p>For the current quarter, NIO is expected to post a loss of $0.46 per share, indicating a change of +9.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.</p><p>The consensus earnings estimate of -$1.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.3%. This estimate has changed -1.2% over the last 30 days.</p><p>For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1.03 indicates a change of +28.1% from what NIO is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +28.5%.</p><p>Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, NIO is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p><p>The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:</p><p><h2>12 Month EPS</h2></p><p><h2>Revenue Growth Forecast</h2></p><p>While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.</p><p>In the case of NIO, the consensus sales estimate of $2.35 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +94.5%. The $9.17 billion and $15.26 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.8% and +66.4%, respectively.</p><p><h2>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</h2></p><p>NIO reported revenues of $1.37 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.7%. EPS of -$0.36 for the same period compares with -$0.42 a year ago.</p><p>Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.42%. The EPS surprise was -16.13%.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, NIO surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.</p><p><h2>Valuation</h2></p><p>No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.</p><p>While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.</p><p>The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.</p><p>NIO is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.</p><p>Shares of this company have returned +6.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Material Services industry, to which ACM Research belongs, has lost 3.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?</p><p>While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.</p><p><h2>Revisions to Earnings Estimates</h2></p><p>Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.</p><p>We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>ACM Research is expected to post earnings of $0.28 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -50.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -44%.</p><p>For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.63 points to no change from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -8%.</p><p>For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.70 indicates a change of +4.3% from what ACM Research is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.9%.</p><p>With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for ACM Research.</p><p>The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:</p><p><h2>12 Month EPS</h2></p><p><h2>Revenue Growth Forecast</h2></p><p>While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.</p><p>For ACM Research, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $191.95 million indicates a year-over-year change of +13.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $726.59 million and $890.94 million estimates indicate +30.3% and +22.6% changes, respectively.</p><p><h2>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</h2></p><p>ACM Research reported revenues of $202.48 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +40.1%. EPS of $0.55 for the same period compares with $0.48 a year ago.</p><p>Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $164.79 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +22.88%. The EPS surprise was +83.33%.</p><p>The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.</p><p><h2>Valuation</h2></p><p>No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.</p><p>Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.</p><p>The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.</p><p>ACM Research is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.</p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ACM Research. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328106/acm-research-inc-acmr-is-attracting-investor-attention-here-is-what-you-should-know?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|most_searched_stocks-2328106">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>
