                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Monster Beverage Corporation</strong> MNST is well-poised for growth, thanks to its robust business strategies. The company&rsquo;s expansion strategy and continued strength in its energy drinks category appear quite encouraging. It has also been launching various products and expanding distribution across the international markets.<br /><br />&nbsp;Analysts seem optimistic about this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is currently pegged at $7.9 billion and $1.77, respectively, implying growth of 10.3% and 14.2% year over year. The consensus mark for 2025 sales and EPS is pegged at $8.7 billion and $2.02, respectively, indicating increases of 9.9% and 14.1%.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Delving Deeper</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Monster Beverage&rsquo;s strength in its energy drinks category has been driving performance for a while now. The company offers a wide range of energy drinks brands such as Monster Energy, Monster Energy Ultra, Monster Rehab, Monster Energy Nitro, Java Monster, Punch Monster, Juice Monster, Monster Hydro Energy Water, Monster Hydro Super Sport, Monster Super Fuel, Monster Dragon Tea, Reign Total Body Fuel, Reign Inferno Thermogenic Fuel, Reign Storm, True North, NOS, Full Throttle, Burn, Mother, Nalu, Ultra Energy, Play Relentless, BPM, BU, Gladiator, Samurai, Live+, Predator and Fury.<br /><br />In the first quarter, the Monster Energy Drinks segment&#39;s net sales increased 10.7% year over year to $1.73 billion. On a currency-adjusted basis, net sales for the segment rose 14.2%. The segment&rsquo;s sales included a negative impact of $54.6 million from adverse currency rates. The company remains optimistic about the opportunities regarding the acquisition of the Bang Energy brand, which it believes will fit well across its portfolio of energy drink brands.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Monster Beverage Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Monster Beverage Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/ab/1718024822.png" title="" width="576" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Monster Beverage Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Monster Beverage Corporation Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Product innovation plays a significant role in the company&#39;s success. Monster Beverage remains committed to product launches and innovation to aid overall business growth. MNST has launched Monster Aussie Lemonade in Japan, Monster Ultra Paradise in Malaysia, Monster Mango Loco and Pipeline Punch in Kazakhstan and Monster Mango Loco in the Philippines. The company has also introduced Predator Gold Strike in Azerbaijan and the Philippines.<br /><br />The company had earlier rolled out its first flavored malt beverage alcohol product, The Beast Unleashed, in the United States and received positive feedback. The product is available in 43 states through a network of beer distributors. This marked the expansion of the distribution of The Beast Unleashed into additional markets, with plans for nationwide distribution by the end of the year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has a solid innovation plan for 2024. Management is optimistic about Nasty Beast Hard Tea and additional alcohol opportunities. The company has rolled out Predator and Fury, its affordable energy drink portfolio, in several markets internationally. Management had expressed satisfaction with its 2023 product innovations, including Monster Energy Zero-Sugar, Ultra Strawberry Dreams and Rainstorm in the United States, along with Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero-Sugar in EMEA.<br /><br />Additionally, the company continues to benefit from its pricing actions across various markets to negate the impacts of rising commodity costs and inflation. MNST continued to implement price hikes in the first quarter, with additional price hikes planned in several other markets ahead.<br /><br />We note that shares of this energy drinks and alternative beverages marketer have gained 5.8% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 6.7% growth over the past six months.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Vital Farms Inc.</strong> VITL offers a range of produced pasture-raised foods. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). VITL has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 102.1%. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vital Farms&rsquo; current financial-year sales and EPS indicates growth of 22.5% and 59.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.<br /><br /><strong>Freshpet </strong>FRPT, which is a pet food company, currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1.

<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 12:25:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Chewy (CHWY) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.24 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.22 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.15 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.</p><p>This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 9.09%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online pet store would post earnings of $0.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.31, delivering a surprise of 47.62%.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.</p><p>Chewy<yt:no-break-space/>, which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $2.86 billion for the quarter ended July 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.09%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.78 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.</p><p>The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.</p><p>Chewy shares have added about 9.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.9%.</p><p><h2>What's Next for Chewy?</h2></p><p>While Chewy has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?</p><p>There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.</p><p>Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Chewy: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.21 on $2.85 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.97 on $11.75 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.</p><p>Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Commerce is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p>Another stock from the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector, Sportsman's Warehouse (SPWH), has yet to report results for the quarter ended July 2024. The results are expected to be released on September 3.</p><p>This outdoor sporting goods specialty retailer is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -125%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.</p><p>Sportsman's Warehouse's revenues are expected to be $284 million, down 8.2% from the year-ago quarter.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328056/chewy-chwy-beats-q2-earnings-estimates?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_4-2328056">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Marvell Technology, Inc.</strong> MRVL will report second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug. 29 after market close.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Marvell projects total revenues for the fiscal second quarter of $1.25 billion (+/- 5%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.25 billion, which indicates a decrease of 6.7% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MRVL anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of 29 cents (+/- 5 cents) for the second quarter. The consensus mark for non-GAAP EPS has remained unchanged at 29 cents, which calls for a 12.1% decline from the year-ago quarter.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/bf/75659.jpg?v=930062554" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Marvell&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters and matched once, the average surprise being 2.5%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Marvell Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Marvell Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/6f/1724842467.png" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" title="" /> <p>Marvell Technology, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Marvell Technology, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.</p><h2>Factors Shaping MRVL&rsquo;s Upcoming Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Marvell&rsquo;s second-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by softness in its product demand as enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. Moreover, continued inventory correction actions by customers are likely to have hurt the company&rsquo;s overall performance in the to-be-reported quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Marvell is projected to report a massive year-over-year decline in revenues across the majority of its end-market segments, including the Enterprise Networking, Carrier Infrastructure, Automotive/Industrial and Consumer end markets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The ongoing inventory correction and weak demand environment are likely to have hurt Enterprise Networking&rsquo;s top-line performance. Our second-quarter revenue estimate for Enterprise Networking is pegged at $153 million, which indicates a year-over-year decline of 53.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A slowdown in IT spending as telecom carriers manage their capital expenditure amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties is anticipated to have negatively impacted the Carrier Infrastructure end-market&rsquo;s revenues. Moreover, the end market&rsquo;s overall performance is anticipated to have been hurt by the completion of the initial wave of the 5G rollout. Our second-quarter revenue estimate for the Carrier Infrastructure is pegged at $71.7 million, which implies a year-over-year decline of 74%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Our model estimates for the Automotive/Industrial and Consumer end markets are pegged at $77.7 million and $83.9 million, calling for a decline of 29.5% and 50%, respectively. A weak demand environment and inventory correction measures are likely to have hurt sales performances in these end markets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the negative impact of the dismal performance across the aforementioned divisions is likely to have been partially offset by improved performance in the Data Center end market. Strong growth in compute programs for artificial intelligence is projected to have driven the segment&rsquo;s performance. Our estimate for the Data Center division&rsquo;s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $863.5 million, which suggests a year-over-year increase of 87.8%.</p><h2>MRVL Stock Price Performance &amp; Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date (YTD), Marvell shares have soared 15.6%, underperforming the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s increase of 17.8%. In the semiconductor industry space, the MRVL stock has underperformed <strong>NVIDIA Corporation</strong> NVDA but outperformed <strong>Micron Technology, Inc.</strong> MU and <strong>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.</strong> AMD.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c7/75660.jpg?v=1863095270" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now, let&rsquo;s look at the value Marvell offers investors at the current levels. MRVL stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month price-to-earnings multiple of 35.34X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 21.65X.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/0c/75661.jpg?v=583396143" style="width: 600px; height: 305px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>US-China Tech War Might Hurt MRVL Stock&rsquo;s Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Marvell&rsquo;s long-term growth prospects remain promising. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the booming artificial intelligence (AI) market. Although Marvell&#39;s chips don&#39;t directly process AI tasks, they play a crucial role in managing and transporting the massive data generated by AI applications. As data centers upgrade with advanced graphic processing units (GPUs) from NVIDIA and AMD to handle AI workloads, the demand for Marvell&#39;s data-handling solutions is expected to increase.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, Marvell is currently facing significant challenges that could impact its share price performance in the near term. One of the most pressing concerns is the U.S. government&rsquo;s tightening restrictions on semiconductor exports to China.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">China represents a substantial market for Marvell, accounting for more than 45% of its total revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The increasing export controls could lead to a meaningful reduction in sales to Chinese customers, which could weigh on Marvell&rsquo;s overall revenue growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the potential effect on sales, the export restrictions could disrupt Marvell&rsquo;s supply chain, leading to increased costs and delays in product development. This would be particularly problematic as Marvell competes in an industry where technological innovation and time-to-market are critical to maintaining a competitive edge.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">While the long-term outlook for Marvell remains bright, the near-term challenges associated with chip export restrictions to China and the stock&rsquo;s high valuation warrant a more cautious approach. The bearish sentiment is further underscored by this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company&#39;s underperformance relative to the broader market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Holding on to MRVL stock in the current environment could mean riding out a prolonged period of underperformance. For investors looking to maximize returns, selling the shares of the company now could be a prudent move.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328058/should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-marvell-stock-ahead-of-q2-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2328058">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 4 Must-Buy Efficient Stocks to Increase Portfolio Returns ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 12:13:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Irrespective of market conditions, companies with favorable efficiency levels are more likely to be investors&rsquo; choices. The reason is that a company with a favorable efficiency level is expected to offer impressive returns as it is believed to be positively correlated to its price performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The efficiency ratio is an indication of a company&rsquo;s financial health. It analyzes how efficiently a company uses its assets and liabilities internally.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, at times it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is why one must consider the popular efficiency ratios listed below while selecting stocks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To that end,&nbsp;<strong>Nova Ltd. </strong>NVMI,<strong> Energizer </strong>ENR,<strong> S&amp;T Bancorp </strong>STBA, and<strong> Norwegian Cruise Line </strong>NCLH made it through the screen process:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Efficiency Ratios &ndash; To be Considered </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Receivables Turnover</strong>:&nbsp; This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company&rsquo;s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the &ldquo;accounts receivable turnover ratio&rdquo; or &ldquo;debtor&rsquo;s turnover ratio&rdquo; is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Asset Utilization</strong>: This ratio indicates a company&rsquo;s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Inventory Turnover</strong>: The ratio of the 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Operating Margin</strong>: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company&rsquo;s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Screening Criteria Using Research Wizard:</strong></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the above-mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank &mdash; Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) &mdash; to the screen to make this strategy more profitable. You can see&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization, and Operating Margin greater than the industry average</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">(Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The use of these few criteria narrowed down the universe of over 7,906 stocks to 15.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are the top four stocks that made it through the screen:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nova</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nova</strong> is a provider of metrology solutions for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing. NVMI has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 12.4%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Energizer</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Energizer </strong>is one of the world&rsquo;s leading manufacturers and distributors of batteries and lighting products. ENR has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 8.5%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>S&amp;T Bancorp</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>S&amp;T Bancorp </strong>is a bank holding company that is engaged in general banking business. STBA has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 7.1%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Norwegian Cruise Line</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Norwegian Cruise Line </strong>&nbsp;is a leading cruise line operator. NCLH has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 5.7%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 12:10:05 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Smucker (SJM) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.44 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.</p><p>This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11.93%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this food maker would post earnings of $2.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.66, delivering a surprise of 14.66%.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.</p><p>Smucker<yt:no-break-space/>, which belongs to the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $2.13 billion for the quarter ended July 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.42%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.81 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.</p><p>The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.</p><p>Smucker shares have lost about 4.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.9%.</p><p><h2>What's Next for Smucker?</h2></p><p>While Smucker has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?</p><p>There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.</p><p>Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Smucker: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.65 on $2.29 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $10.05 on $8.98 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.</p><p>Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Food - Miscellaneous is currently in the top 39% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p>Mama's Creations, Inc.

The long period of consolidation gives rise to a potential significant run-up in the share price of AVAH going forward.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, more than a 100% rally in just three months raises concern for a pullback. In this article, we will discuss the factors that should support the potential bull run. We will also focus on whether investors should buy the stock at present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AVAH&rsquo;s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical &ndash; Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry&rsquo;s growth of 2% and the broader Zacks Medical sector&rsquo;s return of 1.6% in the past three months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the same timeframe, shares of AVGO peers like <strong>DaVita</strong> DVA and <strong>Quest Diagnostics</strong> DGX have risen 5.5% and 11.1%, respectively.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/4f/75662.jpg?v=1781686237" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reported second-quarter results earlier this month. Its revenues grew 7% on a year-over-year basis. The adjusted EBITDA was up more than 27% from the year-ago period&rsquo;s level. This improvement in the top and bottom lines was driven by better payer rate environment as AVAH continues to focus on payers willing to make use of enhanced reimbursement rates and value-based agreements. The company&rsquo;s cost reduction efforts drove strong growth in adjusted EBITDA.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The improving performance is likely to continue in the upcoming quarters on the back of AVAH&rsquo;s several rate improvement initiatives as well as a recovering labor market. However, uncertainty regarding labor and inflationary headwinds may impede share price growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Promising Fundamentals for the AVAH Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Aveanna&rsquo;s strong growth prospect is driven by its favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). AVAH also has a favorable&nbsp; Zacks Style Score of A. A company with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, coupled with a Style Score, or VGM Score of A or B, implies that its stock will outperform the market in the next one to three months. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AVAH stock is also trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, demonstrating strength in the uptrend.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AVAH Stock Trades Above 50-Day and 200-Day Average</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1c/75656.jpg?v=1851562388" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Aveanna generates revenues from three business segments &mdash; Private Duty Services, Home Health &amp; Hospice and Medical Solutions. During the first half of 2024, the company reported growth across all its segments. The company provides a cost-effective patient-preferred and clinically sophisticated solution to patients. It also offers the right solution for payers, referral sources and government partners.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Demand for AVAH solutions continues to be strong as both state and federal governments and managed care organizations are looking for opportunities to expand capacity for home and community-based care. The growing demand for AVAH&rsquo;s solutions is likely to continue with the rise in the aging population.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s primary concern remains the reimbursement rates, which primarily drive its top line. Moreover, a higher reimbursement rate helps the company to offer attractive labor wages to retain caregivers. AVAH remains focused on driving the reimbursement rates higher, which should support its business growth. It continued to progress on several rate improvement initiatives, with both government and preferred payers achieving rate hikes in 12 states.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Aveanna is lobbying to get a rate hike in California, one of AVAH&rsquo;s key markets. The company expects its adjusted EBITDA to ramp up in the rest of 2024 as most of its annual rate increases will typically become effective in the second half.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">During the second-quarter earnings call, AVAH raised its revenue guidance from $1.97 billion to $1.985 billion. The company expects its adjusted EBITDA to cross $158 million, up from the previous guidance of more than $150 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 loss is currently pegged at 5 cents per share, indicating a 54.6% year-over-year improvement. The estimate improved 28.6% over the past 30 days.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/52/75654.jpg?v=1700891348" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Aveanna&rsquo;s preferred payer strategy is also gaining momentum and allowing the company to invest in caregiver wages and recruitment efforts to accelerate the hiring and staffing of nurses for patients. AVAH added five preferred pay agreements in 2024 for its Private Duty Services segment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The preferred payer accounts generated 45% of the company&rsquo;s total Medicare-covered volumes during the second quarter, representing a sequential improvement of 500-basis points. An improving payer-mix should boost top-line growth as well as help the company to offset labor shortages with higher wages and expanding caregiving capacity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AVAH is also gaining from a better payer-mix for its Home Health &amp; Hospice, with a focus on payers willing to reimburse on an episodic basis. The company signed two episodic agreements in the second quarter, taking the year-to-date figure to four. This episodic focus has accelerated its margin expansion and improved clinical outcomes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although AVAH is gaining from the focus on reimbursement rate hikes and preferred or episodic payers, the challenging labor and inflationary environment might pose a challenge for the company.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Cheap Valuation Implies AVAH Stock Growth Potential</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The AVAH stock is currently trading at a discount when compared to the Medical &ndash; Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry. Its forward 12-month P/S of 0.51X is significantly lower than the industry&rsquo;s 2.88 at this moment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is also reflected in its favorable Value score of A, implying the availability of the stock at an attractive valuation even after its significant rally in the past three months.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/2d/75657.jpg?v=1513400777" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Should You Invest in Aveanna Right Now?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Aveanna represents an attractive opportunity for investors backed by strong fundamentals. Moreover, the cheap valuation of the company offers a significant upside potential going forward. The rising reimbursement rates and increasing high-paying payer-mix is paving the way for improving top and bottom-lines in the future. Apart from a favorable Value score, the company&rsquo;s Growth and Momentum score of C implies a moderate pace for the uptrend.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We expect current shareholders to continue to gain from further upside; new investors are also likely to reap the benefits.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328129/aveanna-stock-rallies-110-in-3-months-is-it-still-worth-buying?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2328129">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ ConocoPhillips Taps Raptor Data for Plug & Abandonment Work ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ConocoPhillips (</strong>COP<strong>)</strong>, the U.S. oil giant, has granted a global contract to Raptor Data, an Aberdeen-based technology company, to manufacture and deploy a fleet of tools for well intervention and plug and abandonment (P&amp;A), starting with operations in Norway.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Raptor Data will supply its flagship technology, the Pathfinder system, as part of the contract. Touted as the first plug-and-play in-well verification system, Pathfinder is designed to enhance the verification of bismuth caps &mdash; a chemical element increasingly favored in the oil and gas industry over traditional cement for well intervention and abandonment. Bismuth offers significant advantages in terms of reliability and environmental safety.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Pathfinder system uses a combination of wellbore pressure, temperature, distributed temperature and broadband acoustic analytics to ensure the accurate installation and performance of wellbore plugs. These features provide an innovative solution for P&amp;A operations, crucial for secure and efficient decommissioning oil and gas wells.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">COP&rsquo;s Strategic Partnership to Drive Technological Innovation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Paul McClure, CEO of Raptor Data, shared his enthusiasm for the partnership with ConocoPhillips and emphasized the companies&#39; long-standing collaboration in refining wellbore plug verification technology, particularly for bismuth barriers. He noted that this contract would allow COP to deploy its systems across ConocoPhillips&#39; operations and demonstrate the technology&#39;s effectiveness in ensuring precise barrier installation with measurable assurance metrics, highlighting its potential to set new standards in P&amp;A operations worldwide.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ConocoPhillips&#39; Strong Presence in Norway</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ConocoPhillips operates the Greater Ekofisk Area (&ldquo;GEA&rdquo;) in the North Sea, approximately 300 kilometers southwest of Stavanger, Norway. The GEA consists of five fields, Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla, Tor and Tommeliten A, which produce a mix of oil and gas.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In May, ConocoPhillips brought a new oil project on stream in the southern part of the North Sea, tied to one of these fields, further reinforcing its significant role in Norway&rsquo;s energy landscape.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This latest contract underscores ConocoPhillips&rsquo; commitment to innovation in its operational processes and highlights its focus on strategic growth and efficiency in the energy sector. With the deployment of Raptor Data&#39;s cutting-edge technology, ConocoPhillips is set to enhance its capabilities in P&amp;A. This is in line with the industry trends toward safer, more reliable and environmentally responsible well-decommissioning practices.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">COP&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, ConocoPhillips carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the&nbsp;energy&nbsp;sector may look at some better-ranked stocks like <strong>SM Energy</strong> <strong>Company</strong> SM, <strong>MPLX LP&nbsp;</strong>MPLX and <strong>TechnipFMC plc </strong>FTI. While SM Energy currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), MPLX and TechnipFMC carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SM Energy is set to expand its oil-centered operations in the coming years with an increasing focus on crude oil, especially in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford regions. The company&rsquo;s attractive oil and gas investments should create long-term value for its shareholders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SM&rsquo;s 2024 EPS is pegged at $7.57. The company has a Zacks Style Score of A for Value. It has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 in the past seven days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MPLX derives stable fee-based revenues from long-term contracts, with minimal exposure to commodity-price fluctuations. The partnership&rsquo;s robust capital expenditure forecast for 2024, along with significant expansion initiatives, underscores its commitment to sustainable growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MPLX&rsquo;s 2024 EPS is pegged at $4.21. The company has a Zacks Style Score of B for Value. It has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 in the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TechnipFMC is a leading manufacturer and supplier of products, services and fully integrated technology solutions for the energy industry, with a focus on the subsea segment in offshore basins worldwide. FTI&rsquo;s growing backlog ensures strong revenue visibility and supports margin improvements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FTI&rsquo;s 2024 EPS is pegged at $1.25. The company has a Zacks Style Score of B for Value. It has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 in the past 30 days.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328128/conocophillips-taps-raptor-data-for-plug-abandonment-work?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_energy_sector-2328128">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Albemarle Corporation</strong> ALB is benefiting from higher lithium volumes on project ramp-ups, capacity expansion and productivity actions amid challenges from lower lithium pricing and softness in the Specialties unit.<br /><br />ALB stock is down 55% over a year compared with a 7.8% decline of the industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/67/75648.jpg?v=5827303" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Lithium Project Expansion Actions &amp; Productivity Aid Albemarle</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Albemarle is well-placed to gain from long-term growth in the battery-grade lithium market. The market for lithium batteries and energy storage remains strong, especially for electric vehicles (EVs), offering significant opportunities for the company to develop innovative products and expand capacity. Lithium demand is expected to grow on significant global EV penetration.<br /><br />The company is strategically executing its projects aimed at boosting its global lithium conversion capacity. It remains focused on investing in high-return projects to drive productivity. Healthy customer demand, capacity expansion and plant productivity improvements are supporting its volumes.&nbsp;<br /><br />ALB saw higher sales volumes in its Energy Storage unit in the second quarter of 2024 driven by the ramp-up of lithium projects, including the La Negra expansion in Chile and the processing plant in Qinzhou, China. Albemarle is currently focusing on the optimization and ramp-up of Kemerton I lithium hydroxide conversion plant in Australia. The Salar yield improvement project in Chile has also achieved a 50% operating rate. The Meishan lithium conversion facility in China has also delivered its first commercial sales ahead of schedule.<br /><br />Albemarle is also benefiting from cost-saving and productivity initiatives. The company delivered more than $150 million in restructuring and productivity benefits in the second quarter and is on track to surpass its initial productivity target for 2024 by roughly 50%. ALB is taking actions to maintain its competitive position including the initiation of a comprehensive review of cost and operating structure, optimization of the conversion network and reduction of capital expenditure.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Soft Lithium Prices and Headwinds in Specialties Ail ALB</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Weaker lithium market prices are weighing on the company&rsquo;s performance. ALB&rsquo;s revenues tumbled roughly 40% year over year to $1,430.4 million in the second quarter, hurt by lower prices. Sales from its Energy Storage unit fell around 53% due to lower lithium market prices. Lithium prices have declined amid slowing demand growth for EVs, inventory glut and increased supply. The uncertain macroeconomic environment and high interest rates have weighed on demand. Weaker lithium prices are likely to continue to hurt the company&rsquo;s results in the third quarter.<br /><br />ALB&rsquo;s Specialties unit is exposed to headwinds from demand and pricing weakness. Sales from the segment fell around 10% year over year in the second quarter. The segment faces demand headwinds in the consumer electronics market. The demand weakness is expected to continue in the third quarter. Albemarle has lowered its adjusted EBITDA outlook for the Specialties unit factoring in slower-than-expected market recovery and higher logistics costs related to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. It now sees an adjusted EBITDA of $210-$260 million for the segment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Albemarle Corporation Price and Consensus</h3><p>&nbsp;</p> <img alt="Albemarle Corporation Price and Consensus" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/07/1724838273.png" title="" width="583" /> <p>Albemarle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Albemarle Corporation Quote</p></div><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Better-ranked stocks in the Basic Materials space are <strong>Newmont Corporation</strong> NEM, <strong>Element Solutions Inc</strong> ESI and <strong>Eldorado Gold Corporation</strong> EGO, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Newmont&rsquo;s current-year earnings is pegged at $2.82, indicating a rise of 75.2% from year-ago levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NEM&rsquo;s earnings has increased 16% in the past 60 days. The stock has rallied around 34% in the past year.&nbsp;<br /><br />The consensus estimate for Element Solutions&rsquo; current-year earnings has increased by 0.7% in the past 60 days. ESI beat the consensus estimate in three of the last four quarters while delivering in-line results on the other occasion. In this timeframe, it delivered an earnings surprise of around 3.8%, on average.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Eldorado Gold&rsquo;s current year earnings is pegged at $1.35 per share, indicating a year-over-year rise of 136.8%. EGO beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters, with the average earnings surprise being 430.3%. The company&#39;s shares have rallied roughly 93% in the past year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328127/here-s-why-you-should-retain-albemarle-stock-in-your-portfolio?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2328127">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 2 Must-Buy Medical Stocks With Strong Momentum ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Wall Street has been maintaining its northbound journey in the second half of 2024 after an impressive first half. U.S. stock markets&rsquo; rally, which started at the beginning of 2023 is showing no signs of declining barring some minor fluctuations. The rally is likely to gather pace over the remaining months this year as an interest rate cut in September is now almost certain.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Under this circumstance, it should be prudent for investors to put money in those stocks with strong momentum. Here we are recommending two medical stocks &mdash; <strong>DaVita Inc.</strong> DVA and <strong>Illumina Inc.</strong> ILMN.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These stocks have seen strong earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. This indicates that market participants are expecting these companies to do good business in the near future. Finally, both stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Zacks Momentum Score of A. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The combination of a top Zacks Rank, solid earnings estimate revisions and stock price momentum should drive prices further in the near term.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The chart below shows the price performance of our two picks in the past month.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/92/75651.jpg?v=1584924466" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DaVita Inc.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">DaVita has been expanding its global presence via its Integrated Kidney Care business. DVA has been generating solid revenues by providing dialysis services. DVA has been opening and acquiring several dialysis centers both within the United States and overseas, which is promising. DaVita&rsquo;s four separate purchase agreements with Fresenius Medical Care also look promising. The company&rsquo;s second-quarter 2024 results came in better than expected.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strong Earnings Estimate Revisions for DVA</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">DaVita has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 5.4% and 18%, respectively, for the current year. The stock has seen positive earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter, current year, next quarter and next year in the last seven days. The stock price of DVA surged 11.3% in the past month.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/33/75652.jpg?v=1651070786" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Illumina Inc.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Illumina is successfully advancing its presence in the gene-sequencing market with competitive products and a strong pipeline. ILMN&rsquo;s strategic initiatives and collaborations are boosting the NGS adoption, helping the company maintain leadership in research and clinical markets.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Illumina&rsquo;s growing oncology portfolio is driving advancements in cancer genomics, suggesting a long-term growth potential in this space. Moreover, ILMN now offers the full range of NovaSeq X products and availed XLEAP-SBS chemistry to mid-throughput customers. Favorable solvency is also encouraging.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strong Earnings Estimate Revisions for ILMN</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Illumina has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.3% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year. The stock has seen positive earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter, current year, next quarter and next year in the last 30 days. The stock price of ILMN advanced 7.7% in the past month.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/94/75653.jpg?v=96080167" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328125/2-must-buy-medical-stocks-with-strong-momentum?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|investment_ideas-2328125">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ NVIDIA's Stock Awaiting $300 Billion Impact? ETFs in Focus ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Traders in the U.S. equity options market are watchfully waiting for <strong>NVIDIA</strong>&#39;s NVDA earnings report, expecting it to create a huge shift in the company&#39;s market value. Options pricing indicates an anticipated 9.8% swing in NVIDIA&#39;s shares following the earnings announcement (which is scheduled today after the market closes), topping share price swings seen in the past three years.</p><p>Analysts expect any meaningful changes in earnings to impact NVIDIA&#39;s market capitalization by about $305 billion, as quoted on Reuters, published on Yahoo Finance. NVIDIA&rsquo;s current market capitalization is about $3.11 trillion. The NVIDIA stock is up 166.4% so far this year.</p><p>If you want to protect yourself from any huge downside movement, you can try betting on NVIDIA-heavy exchange-traded funds (ETF). ETFs always minimize company-specific concentration risks. Some NVIDIA-heavy ETFs include <strong>Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF</strong> SHOC, <strong>VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF</strong> SMH, <strong>Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund</strong> XLK, <strong>Grizzle Growth ETF</strong> DARP and <strong>TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF</strong> LRNZ.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Implications of Potential NVIDIA Moves on Wall Street</strong></span></p><p>NVIDIA, well-known for its dominance in artificial intelligence chips, holds significant weight in the broader market. Its year-to-date performance, contributing around a quarter of the S&amp;P 500&#39;s gains, indicates its key role. Any big move in NVIDIA shares would cut down the market capitalization of 95% of the S&amp;P 500 constituents, including Netflix and Merck, according to LSEG data, the above-mentioned Reuters article noted.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Options Market Sentiment Prior to NVDA Earnings</strong></span></p><p>Options traders are mainly focused on potential upside gains rather than downside risks ahead of NVIDIA&#39;s earnings. Market sentiment indicates a 7% probability of the stock surging over 20% by Friday, contrasting with a 4% likelihood of a similar margin of selloff.</p><p>There is optimism around NVIDIA earnings, termed &quot;FOMO insurance,&quot; which reflects traders&#39; fears of missing out on a rally rather than concerns about losses. We would like to note that NVIDIA&#39;s stock volatility remains much higher than that of other trillion-dollar companies.</p><p>NVIDIA&rsquo;s last five years&rsquo; growth rate is 54.20% versus 9.10% growth recorded by the underlying industry Semiconductor &ndash; General. NVIDIA&rsquo;s next five years&rsquo; growth rate is expected to be 37.60% versus 16.80% projected for the underlying industry.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Earnings Whispers for NVDA</strong></span></p><p>NVIDIA currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.23% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive&nbsp;Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our&nbsp;Earnings ESP Filter.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Broker Rating on NVDA</strong></span></p><p>NVIDIA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.25 a month ago based on 40 recommendations.</p><p>Of the 40 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 87.5% and 5% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 85%, while Buy represented 5%.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Price Target of NVIDIA</strong></span></p><p>Based on short-term price targets offered by 40 analysts, the average price target for NVIDIA comes to $142.48 ahead of earnings release. The forecasts range from a low of $90.00 to a high of $200.00. The average price target represents an increase of 11% from the last closing price of $128.30.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328046/nvidia-s-stock-awaiting-300-billion-impact-etfs-in-focus?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2328046">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ ExxonMobil Plans $1B Sale of Permian Assets Amid Shale Focus ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 11:51:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ExxonMobil Corporation (</strong>XOM<strong>), </strong>the U.S. energy giant, is reportedly looking to sell a package of conventional oil assets in the Permian Basin, aiming to streamline its portfolio and focus on shale production. The transaction could potentially fetch around $1 billion, depending on oil prices at the time of the sale, according to a Bloomberg report.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">XOM Puts Some Permian Assets on the Block</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The assets are located in the Central Basin of the Permian, spanning across West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. These include older wells, which, while still producing stable quantities of oil, are considered less productive compared to the newer shale operations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This move aligns with ExxonMobil&rsquo;s strategy to optimize its asset portfolio by divesting from older, conventional assets and focusing on more profitable shale operations. The company has not disclosed the specific number of wells included in the sale but emphasized that the decision to explore market interest for these assets is a regular part of its business strategy.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">ExxonMobil&rsquo;s Shift Toward Shale Production</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ExxonMobil&#39;s decision came on the heels of its acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources earlier this year, which marked a significant push toward enhancing its shale production capabilities. Shale oil extraction, known for its lower costs and faster returns, is increasingly becoming the focal point for major oil companies as they seek to improve profitability and reduce exposure to volatile oil markets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">XOM&rsquo;s exploration of market interest for select conventional assets in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico aligns with its ongoing strategy to assess and optimize its portfolio, according to the report.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Will the Sale Benefit XOM?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The potential sale is part of a larger trend in the oil and gas industry, where the total value of deals has doubled to $210 billion this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This surge in transactions reflects a dynamic market where companies are continuously reshaping their portfolios to adapt to changing economic conditions and technological advancements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For ExxonMobil, the shift from conventional to shale assets underscores its commitment to adapting to market demands and positioning itself for future growth. As the company moves forward with the sale, the outcome will likely depend on oil price movements and investor appetite for older, conventional oil-producing assets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ExxonMobil&rsquo;s planned sale of its Permian Basin assets signals a strategic movement toward more efficient and profitable shale production. As the company continues to refine its asset portfolio, this sale could provide valuable capital to further invest in its core operations, reinforcing its position in the evolving energy landscape.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">XOM&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ExxonMobil currently carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the&nbsp;energy&nbsp;sector may look at some better-ranked stocks like <strong>SM Energy</strong> <strong>Company</strong> SM, <strong>MPLX LP&nbsp;</strong>MPLX and <strong>TechnipFMC plc </strong>FTI. While SM Energy currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), MPLX and TechnipFMC carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SM Energy is set to expand its oil-centered operations in the coming years with an increasing focus on crude oil, especially in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford regions. The company&rsquo;s attractive oil and gas investments should create long-term value for its shareholders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SM&rsquo;s 2024 EPS is pegged at $7.57. The company has a Zacks Style Score of A for Value. It has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 in the past seven days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MPLX derives stable fee-based revenues from long-term contracts, with minimal exposure to commodity-price fluctuations. The partnership&rsquo;s robust capital expenditure forecast for 2024, along with significant expansion initiatives, underscores its commitment to sustainable growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MPLX&rsquo;s 2024 EPS is pegged at $4.21. The company has a Zacks Style Score of B for Value. It has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 in the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TechnipFMC is a leading manufacturer and supplier of products, services and fully integrated technology solutions for the energy industry, with a focus on the subsea segment in offshore basins worldwide. FTI&rsquo;s growing backlog ensures strong revenue visibility and supports margin improvements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FTI&rsquo;s 2024 EPS is pegged at $1.25. The company has a Zacks Style Score of B for Value. It has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 in the past 30 days.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328085/exxonmobil-plans-1b-sale-of-permian-assets-amid-shale-focus?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_energy_sector-2328085">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 5 Stocks With Low Price-to-Sales Ratios to Elevate Your Portfolio ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Investing in stocks, after analyzing the valuation metrics, is considered one of the best practices. The price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice when considering the valuation metrics. This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, the price-to-sales ratio is convenient for determining the value of stocks incurring losses or in an early development cycle, generating meager or no profit.</p><h2>What&rsquo;s the Price-to-Sales Ratio?</h2><p><br />While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its price-to-sales can indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure a company&#39;s growth is not overvalued.<br /><br />A stock&rsquo;s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors pay for each dollar of revenue generated by a company.<br /><br />If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. A stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar&rsquo;s worth. &nbsp;<br /><br />Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.<br /><br />The price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings, as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.<br /><br />However, one should keep in mind that a company with a high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap, and, ultimately, a higher price-to-sales ratio.<br /><br />In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.<br /><br /><strong>Peabody Energy</strong> BTU, <strong>PriceSmart </strong>PSMT, <strong>Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd. </strong>HG, <strong>Precision Drilling</strong> PDS and <strong>The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. </strong>GBX are some companies with a low price-to-sales ratio and the potential to offer higher returns.</p><h2>Screening Parameters</h2><p><br /><strong>Price to Sales less than the Median Price to Sales for its Industry:</strong> The lower the price-to-sales ratio, the better.<br /><br /><strong>Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than the Median Price to Earnings for its Industry:</strong> The lower, the better.<br /><br /><strong>Price to Book (Common Equity) less than the Median Price to Book for its Industry: </strong>This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.<br /><br /><strong>Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than the Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: </strong>A company with less debt should have a stable price-to-sales ratio.<br /><br /><strong>Current Price greater than or equal to $5:</strong> The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2 (Buy):</strong> Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment.<br /><br /><strong>Value Score less than or equal to B: </strong>Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.<br /><br />Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified after the screening:<br /><br /><strong>Peabody Energy</strong> is engaged in the coal mining business in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, India, Brazil, Belgium, Chile, France, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, South Korea and Germany. The company operates through the Seaborne Thermal, Seaborne Metallurgical, Powder River Basin, Other U.S. Thermal, and Corporate and Other segments.<br /><br />BTU supplies coal primarily to electricity generators, industrial facilities and steel manufacturers. It also engages in marketing and brokering of coal from other coal producers; trading coal and freight-related contracts; and providing transportation-related services. BTU has a Value Score of A and presently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>PriceSmart </strong>operates U.S.-style membership shopping warehouse clubs in the United States, Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia. It also operates an e-commerce platform for online ordering, curbside pickup and delivery services. PriceSmart is a highly respected and valued brand in all markets it serves. PSMT is focused on improving sales, operating efficiencies and using technology to enhance its business performance.<br /><br />Providing omnichannel shopping options for its members, including sales through its app and desktop website, is one of the company&rsquo;s growth drivers. Its private label membership selection brand continues to be a significant area of focus based on the good value it brings to members. PSMT currently has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2.<br /><br />Based in Pembroke, Bermuda,<strong> Hamilton </strong>provides underwriting specialty insurance and reinsurance risks in Bermuda and internationally. Its three underwriting platforms &mdash; Hamilton Global Specialty, Hamilton Re and Hamilton Select &mdash; each with dedicated and experienced leadership, provide access to diversified and profitable markets around the world.<br /><br />Hamilton is focused on underwriting expertise, enhanced by data and technology, to create significant shareholder value. HG has a Value Score of A and currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1.<br /><br /><strong>Precision Drilling</strong>, an oilfield services company, provides onshore drilling, completion, and production services to exploration and production firms in the oil, natural gas and geothermal sectors across North America and the Middle East. In the United States, the company has been focused on optimizing operational performance for its customers while seeking to improve field margins and cash flow generation.<br /><br />Precision Drilling has a positive long-term outlook for U.S. drilling, supported by the expected launch of Gulf Coast LNG facilities over the next three years and the completion of several major oil and gas mergers and acquisitions. The company&#39;s Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is driving stable returns for producers, leading to increased heavy oil drilling activity. Additionally, the imminent start-up of LNG Canada is expected to improve and stabilize natural gas prices, supporting more drilling in the Montney region. PDS has a Value Score of A and sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present.<br /><br /><strong>Greenbrier </strong>is a leading international supplier of equipment and services to global freight transportation markets. The company&rsquo;s broad product lineup, extensive market relationships, supportive customer experience and deep commercial origination capabilities create a unique leadership position and enable ongoing success. These factors provide revenue visibility, while supporting its profitable leasing business, which is growing through disciplined investments in leased railcar fleet and robust lease renewals.<br /><br />The company is progressing well on its strategic goals.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Global Blue Group Holding AG (GB) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.03 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.06 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.01 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.</p><p>This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -50%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.01, delivering a surprise of -75%.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.</p><p>Global Blue Group<yt:no-break-space/>, which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, posted revenues of $126.75 million for the quarter ended June 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.53%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $102.85 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.</p><p>The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.</p><p>Global Blue Group shares have lost about 0.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.9%.</p><p><h2>What's Next for Global Blue Group?</h2></p><p>While Global Blue Group has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?</p><p>There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.</p><p>Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Global Blue Group: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.09 on $148.36 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.30 on $562.31 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.</p><p>Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial Transaction Services is currently in the top 37% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p>One other stock from the same industry, Cantaloupe (CTLP), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on September 10.</p><p>This electronic payment and wireless networking company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.05 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +25%.

<![CDATA[ Powell Industries, and Charles Schwab have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <h3>For Immediate Release</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash;August 28, 2024 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Powell Industries POWL, as the Bull of the Day and Charles Schwab SCHW, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Steve Madden SHOO, Birkenstock BIRK and Deckers Outdoor DECK.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bull of the Day:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>Powell Industries &nbsp;</strong>is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that provides custom-engineered equipment and systems for the management, distribution, and control of electrical energy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After breaking out earlier this year, POWL has seen some volatility but mostly traded sideways. More recently, the stock has made another push higher after a strong quarter and now looks to take out all-time highs.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">About the Company</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Powell Industries was founded in 1947 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas. The company&rsquo;s primary focus is on serving the energy, utilities, transportation, and industrial markets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Powell designs and manufactures a range of products, including power control rooms, electrical enclosures, switchgear, and motor control centers, which are used in applications like power generation, distribution, and automation. The company serves customers globally, offering solutions that help ensure electrical systems are reliable, safe, and efficient, particularly for mission-critical infrastructure in industries such as oil and gas, utilities, and transportation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock has Zacks Style Scores of &ldquo;B&rdquo; in both Growth and Value. The company has a market cap has a market cap of $2.3 billion and a Forward PE of 16. The stock also pays a small dividend of half a percent.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Q3 Earnings Beat</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">In late July, Powell posted a strong quarter, beating estimates by 79%. EPS came in at $3.79, which was up from $1.52 last year. Revenues came in at $255.1M v the $171.4M last year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Net new orders were $235M, which was higher by 19%. The company had a backlog of $1.3B in the prior quarter and was able to keep that number at $1.3B after expanding its capacity. Management commented that excellent project execution improved gross margins by 510 basis points.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors loved the numbers and took the stock higher by over 25%. The stock did give most of the gains back during the early August market sell-off but has since made post-earnings highs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Powell Industries, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Powell Industries, Inc. Quote</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Estimates Spike Higher</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">After the earnings report, analysts were quick to lift numbers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the current quarter, estimates have gone from $2.19 to $3.49. This is a 60% jump in just the last month. For the current year, estimates have been taken 33% higher, going from $9.04 to $12.01.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Looking longer term, estimates are pointing strongly higher. Over the last 90 days, numbers have been taken from $2.26 to $2.30, or 38%.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Technicals</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock broke higher, moving from $75 to $100, after reporting earnings in late January. It never looked back, powering its way up to the $200 level before pulling back to the $125 level.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">That $125 spot happened to be the 61.8% retracement, which started a rally into another strong quarter that took the stock to new highs at $209.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Once again, the stock pulled back in July to that $125 level, which happened to be the 200-day MA this time around.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The latest quarter brought the buyers back and the stock looks to take out the $209 high.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For those looking at Fibonacci levels, the 161.8% extension drawn from all-time highs to recent lows is $258. That target is another 40% higher than current trading levels.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Those looking for a pullback can focus on the 21-day moving average at $168 or the 50-day MA at $154.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bottom Line</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Powell Industries is an under-the-radar small-cap stock that is just getting started.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company is hitting on all cylinders on the fundamental side and the chart looks great after the bulls took out the post-earnings highs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While waiting for a pullback makes sense for some investors, the bulls seem to have strong momentum. POWL should hit all-time highs before its next earnings report and if they can repeat this quarter&#39;s performance, we should see a very strong finish into the end of the year.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bear of the Day:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charles Schwab </strong>is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is a savings and loan holding company, providing wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock was up over 10% on the year until reporting disappointing earnings in July. Since then, the stock dropped over 15% and is now red for the year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors might be tempted to buy the dip, but with the stock challenging 2024 lows, any market weakness could force another leg down.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">About the Company</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Charles Schwab was founded in 1971 and is headquartered in Westlake, Texas. The company&#39;s main subsidiaries include Charles Schwab &amp; Co. (securities broker-dealer), Charles Schwab Investment Management (an investment advisor for Schwab&#39;s proprietary mutual funds and Schwab&rsquo;s exchange-traded funds or ETFs), and Charles Schwab Bank (a federal savings bank).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has nearly 400 branches across 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as locations in Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Singapore.As of Jun 30, 2024, Schwab had 35.6 million active brokerage accounts, 1.9 million banking accounts, and 5.4 million workplace plan participant accounts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock has a market cap of $115 billion and a Forward PE of 21. The stock holds Zacks Style Scores of &ldquo;F&rdquo; in Value, and &ldquo;D&rdquo; in Growth.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Q2 Earnings</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">On July 16<sup>th</sup>, Schwab reported earnings in line but missed on revenues. The company guided revenue flat to 2% y/y and said FY24 expenses would grow 2% y/y. The company pointed to certain uncontrollable items such as the increase in the exchange processing fee rate, incremental FDIC special assessment, and accrual related to the industry-wide regulatory review of off-channel communications<em>.</em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Schwab also reported that its net interest margin (NIM), which is a key measure of profitability for financial firms, was under pressure. This happened because higher interest rates caused clients to move funds from low-interest cash sweep accounts to higher-yielding investment products, reducing Schwab&rsquo;s ability to earn interest on client cash balances.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With that, the company saw a reduction in cash balances and said it would pause its share buyback program to pay off debt.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Estimates Trending Lower</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Since the earnings report, analysts have started to cut their estimates and price targets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the current quarter, the estimates have dropped over the last 90 days, going from $0.87 to $0.75, or 14%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The next quarter has seen a similar drop, with numbers falling from $0.93 to $0.83, or 10% over that same time frame.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Looking at next year over the last 90 days, analysts have dropped estimates by 9%, falling from $4.44 to $4.01.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the drop in estimates, there have been analyst price target cuts as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Piper/Sandler was the most recent, cutting its target to $64 from $80.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Technical Take</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">After earnings stock is traded near the 2024 lows at $59.67, which came in late January. For now, investors have defended that low after the earnings drop. However, any market weakness would likely take stops out below the $60 area.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To show some progress, the bulls would need to back the 200-day MA at $68. The 50-day is attempting to breach that $68 level which would signal a &ldquo;Death Cross&rdquo;, which is extremely bearish.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If it starts to trend lower, the stock could fall to the $50-55 level, which was the support in late 2023.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">In Summary</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Charles Schwab is facing significant headwinds following its disappointing July earnings report. Despite being a strong player in the financial services industry, challenges like pressure on its net interest margin, declining cash balances, and pausing its share buyback program have caused analysts to cut estimates and price targets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While some investors may be tempted to buy the dip, the stock&#39;s struggle to hold support at key technical levels, coupled with the possibility of a death cross, suggests caution. Any broader market weakness could lead to further downside, making it a risky bet in the near term.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Additional content:</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Consumer Demand Melts Higher for These 3 Companies: DECK, SHOO, BIRK</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">We&rsquo;ve seen somewhat mixed reads on the state of the consumer this year, with big-ticket discretionary items continuing to face a demand cooldown while other general merchandise categories, such as apparel, have primarily remained intact for a fair share of companies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Specifically, several footwear-centric apparel companies have enjoyed strong gains over the past year, a list that includes <strong>Steve Madden</strong>, <strong>Birkenstock </strong>and <strong>Deckers Outdoor</strong>. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last year, with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector blended in as a benchmark.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at what&rsquo;s been driving the positivity.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Birkenstock Posts Record Sales</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Birkenstock has undergone significant changes in recent years, expanding its product catalog nicely. It recently enjoyed a notably strong period, posting record Q2 sales that grew more than 20% year-over-year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As a result of the robust demand, BIRK upped its full-year revenue guidance to 20%, with investors also raising their expectations accordingly post-earnings. The stock currently sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As shown below, the sales revisions trend for its FY24 has been positive since the beginning of 2024, up a staggering 25% since. The company has overall been witnessing a demand snowball, reporting strong consumer demand across all its categories, channels, and segments throughout the above-mentioned period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s worth noting that the company&rsquo;s earnings outlook also shot higher alongside sales expectations, with the $1.40 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up nearly 6% over the last year and seeing a big boost starting back in May.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Steve Madden Reports Robust Sales Growth</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Steve Madden, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), also recently delivered a favorable quarterly release, posting an 11% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and reporting sales nearly 4% ahead of the consensus. EPS saw a 21% increase, whereas sales shot nearly 20% higher from the year-ago period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s top line has recovered nicely over recent periods, with SHOO posting double-digit percentage year-over-year sales growth rates in each of its last three quarters. The sales outlook for its current fiscal year has remained bullish over the last year, with the $2.2 billion expected up nearly 9% across the period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, Steve Madden&rsquo;s margins have been consistently stable over recent years, as shown in the trailing twelve-month chart below. Operational efficiencies have aided its profitability picture, with key strategic initiatives also providing tailwinds.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company maintained its current year outlook following the results, still expecting annual sales growth in a band of 11% - 13% relative to FY23. Shares could also interest income-focused investors, currently yielding 1.9% annually compared to the Zacks Consumer Discretionary average of 0.9%.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Deckers Outdoor Brand Momentum Continues</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Deckers Outdoor, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), recently enjoyed a strong quarter, beating both earnings and revenue expectations handily. Big growth was delivered, with EPS growing a staggering 90% year-over-year alongside a 22% increase in sales.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Continued brand momentum among UGG and Hoka shoes aided the favorable quarter, leading the company to up its current fiscal year outlook. Analysts have updated their outlook for the company&rsquo;s current fiscal year accordingly following the print, with the $31.58 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has also been enjoying margin expansion, brightening its profitability picture nicely. It enjoyed the same throughout its latest release, with its gross margin expanding to 56.9% vs 51.3% in the year-ago period.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bottom Line</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">While we&rsquo;ve seen pockets of consumer weakness, it certainly hasn&rsquo;t been broad-based, reflected by results we&rsquo;ve gotten from several consumer-facing companies, including those listed above.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Still, other big names, such as Nike, haven&rsquo;t experienced the same positivity among consumers, raising some questions among investors. All in all, the Cons. Discretionary names that have been truly firing on all cylinders, enjoying robust consumer demand, have been aided by remarkable management teams.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the flip side, those struggling have failed to meet consumers&rsquo; ever-changing needs and wants, reflected by slowing sales.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+44.9%, +48.4%</strong> and <strong>+55.2%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Media Contact</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

<![CDATA[ Golden Ocean Group (GOGL) Tops Q2 Earnings and Revenue Estimates ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 11:05:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Golden Ocean Group (GOGL) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.32 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.28 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.13 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.</p><p>This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14.29%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this shipping company would post earnings of $0.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.29, delivering a surprise of 26.09%.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.</p><p>Golden Ocean Group<yt:no-break-space/>, which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Shipping industry, posted revenues of $197.35 million for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.12%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $153.99 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.</p><p>The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.</p><p>Golden Ocean Group shares have added about 29.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.9%.</p><p><h2>What's Next for Golden Ocean Group?</h2></p><p>While Golden Ocean Group has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?</p><p>There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.</p><p>Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Golden Ocean Group: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.40 on $214.72 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.43 on $826.15 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.</p><p>Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Transportation - Shipping is currently in the bottom 44% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p>One other stock from the same industry, Nordic American Tankers (NAT), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 29.</p><p>This tanker company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -46.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.</p><p>Nordic American Tankers' revenues are expected to be $54.34 million, down 19.9% from the year-ago quarter.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328028/golden-ocean-group-gogl-tops-q2-earnings-and-revenue-estimates?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_4-2328028">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Is Columbia Global Technology Growth A (CTCAX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>If you've been stuck searching for Sector - Tech funds, consider Columbia Global Technology Growth A (CTCAX) as a possibility. CTCAX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.</p><p><h2>Objective</h2></p><p>CTCAX is part of the Sector - Tech category, which boasts an array of different possible selections. With a much more diversified approach, Sector - Tech mutual funds give investors a way to own a stake in a notoriously risky sector. Tech companies are in various industries like semiconductors, software, internet, and networking, among others.</p><p><h2>History of Fund/Manager</h2></p><p>Columbia is responsible for CTCAX, and the company is based out of Kansas City, MO. Columbia Global Technology Growth A made its debut in November of 2002, and since then, CTCAX has accumulated about $841.84 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. Rahul Narang is the fund's current manager and has held that role since July of 2012.</p><p><h2>Performance</h2></p><p>Of course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 19.88%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3 -year annualized total return of 9.76%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.</p><p>It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.</p><p>When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of CTCAX over the past three years is 24.75% compared to the category average of 0%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 22.91% compared to the category average of 9%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.</p><p><h2>Risk Factors</h2></p><p>Investors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.15, so it is likely going to be more volatile than the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&P 500. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a positive alpha of 3.2. This means that managers in this portfolio are skilled in picking securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.</p><p><h2>Expenses</h2></p><p>Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, CTCAX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1.18% compared to the category average of 30%. So, CTCAX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.</p><p>While the minimum initial investment for the product is $2,000, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.</p><p>Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>Overall, Columbia Global Technology Growth A ( CTCAX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, worse downside risk, and lower fees, Columbia Global Technology Growth A ( CTCAX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.</p><p>For additional information on this product, or to compare it to other mutual funds in the Sector - Tech, make sure to go to www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds for additional information. Want to learn even more? We have a full suite of tools on stocks that you can use to find the best choices for your portfolio too, no matter what kind of investor you are.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328024/is-columbia-global-technology-growth-a-ctcax-a-strong-mutual-fund-pick-right-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-mutual_fund_equity_report-2328024">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Any investors who are searching for Index funds should take a look at Schwab S&P 500 Index (SWPPX). The fund does not have a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, though we have been able to explore other metrics like performance, volatility, and cost.</p><p><h2>History of Fund/Manager</h2></p><p>SWPPX finds itself in the Schwab Funds family, based out of San Francisco, CA. Schwab S&P 500 Index debuted in May of 1997. Since then, SWPPX has accumulated assets of about $98.64 billion, according to the most recently available information. A team of investment professionals is the fund's current manager.</p><p><h2>Performance</h2></p><p>Of course, investors look for strong performance in funds. SWPPX has a 5-year annualized total return of 14.96% and is in the top third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 9.56%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.</p><p>It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge.

The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. SWPPX's standard deviation over the past three years is 17.71% compared to the category average of 0%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 18.06% compared to the category average of 4%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.</p><p><h2>Risk Factors</h2></p><p>Investors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1, so it is likely going to be as volatile as the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&P 500. The fund has produced a positive alpha over the past 5 years of 0.01, which shows that managers in this portfolio are skilled in picking securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.</p><p><h2>Expenses</h2></p><p>For investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWPPX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.02% compared to the category average of 58%. From a cost perspective, SWPPX is actually cheaper than its peers.</p><p>While the minimum initial investment for the product is $0, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.</p><p>Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration.

<![CDATA[ <p>Any investors hoping to find a High Yield - Bonds fund could think about starting with Virtus Seix Floating Rate High Income I (SAMBX). SAMBX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.</p><p><h2>Objective</h2></p><p>SAMBX is part of the High Yield - Bonds section, which is a segment that boasts many possible options. Often referred to as " junk " bonds, High Yield - Bonds funds sit below investment grade, meaning they are at a high default risk compared to their investment grade peers. However, one advantage to junk bonds is that they generally pay out higher yields while posing similar interest rate risks to their investment grade counterparts.</p><p><h2>History of Fund/Manager</h2></p><p>Virtus Funds is based in Hartford, CT, and is the manager of SAMBX. Virtus Seix Floating Rate High Income I debuted in March of 2006. Since then, SAMBX has accumulated assets of about $1.20 billion, according to the most recently available information. The fund is currently managed by a team of investment professionals.</p><p><h2>Performance</h2></p><p>Obviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 4.37%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3 -year annualized total return of 5.69%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.</p><p>It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.</p><p>When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of SAMBX over the past three years is 3.75% compared to the category average of 36%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 6.79% compared to the category average of -16%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.</p><p><h2>Expenses</h2></p><p>Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, SAMBX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.64% compared to the category average of 1%. From a cost perspective, SAMBX is actually cheaper than its peers.</p><p>While the minimum initial investment for the product is $100,000, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.</p><p>Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration.

Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.</p><p>When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 69%, the standard deviation of NHMAX over the past three years is 12.34%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 12.14% compared to the category average of -37%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.</p><p>This fund has a beta of 1.15, meaning that it is more volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. Taking this into account, NHMAX has a positive alpha of 1.79, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.</p><p><h2>Ratings</h2></p><p>Investors should also consider a bond's rating, which is a grade ( 'AAA' to 'D' ) given to a bond that indicates its credit quality. With this letter scale in mind, NHMAX has 6.34% in medium quality bonds, with ratings of 'A' to 'BBB'. The fund has an average quality of BBB, and focuses on medium quality securities.</p><p>However, it is worth noting that 75 % of the bonds in this fund are not ranked, so take the average quality level with a bit of caution.</p><p><h2>Expenses</h2></p><p>As competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, NHMAX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 2.11% compared to the category average of 0%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, NHMAX is actually more expensive than its peers.</p><p>Investors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $3,000; each subsequent investment needs to be at least $100.</p><p>Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>Overall, even with its comparatively strong performance, worse downside risk, and higher fees, Nuveen High Yield Municipals Bond A ( NHMAX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and therefore looks a good potential choice for investors right now.</p><p>Your research on the Muni - Bonds segment doesn't have to stop here.

<![CDATA[ International Dividend ETF (DWX) Hit a 52-Week High ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>For investors seeking momentum, <strong>SPDR S&amp;P International Dividend ETF </strong>DWX is probably on the radar. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up 20.6% from its 52-week low price of $31.80/share.</p><p>But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea of where it might be headed:</p><h2><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>DWX in Focus</strong></span></h2><p>The underlying S&amp;P International Dividend Opportunities Index measures the performance of 100 highest dividend-yielding common stocks and ADRs listed in primary exchanges of countries included in the S&amp;P Global BMI ex U.S. The product charges 45 bps in annual fees and yields 3.79% annually.</p><p>Japan takes the top position in the fund, with about 23.20% exposure. Canada (14.47%) and United Kingdom (10.75%) take the next two positions (see: all World ETFs here).</p><h2><p><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Why the Move?</strong></span></h2><p>Dividend-paying stocks provide a steady income stream and help mitigate potential losses during weaker market periods. These stocks offer the best of both worlds &mdash; safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices. The ETF DWX offers hefty yields, which made it a lucrative bet to investors.</p><h2><p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">More Gains Ahead</span>?</strong></h2><p>The ETF DWX might continue its strong performance in the near term, with a positive weighted alpha of 15.33 (per barchart.com), which gives cues of a further rally.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328021/international-dividend-etf-dwx-hit-a-52-week-high?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2328021">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 3 Small-Cap Growth Mutual Funds to Buy for Solid Returns ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Small-cap growth funds are natural choices for investors with a high-risk appetite when capital appreciation over the long term takes precedence over dividend payouts. These funds focus on realizing an appreciable amount of capital growth by investing in stocks projected to rise in value over the long term.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, small-cap funds are good choices for investors seeking diversification across different sectors and companies. These generally invest in companies having a market cap lower than $2 billion. The companies, smaller in size, offer growth potential, and their market capitalization may increase subsequently. Also, due to their lower international exposure, small-cap funds offer higher protection than their large- and mid-cap counterparts against any global downturn.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Below, we share with you three top-ranked small-cap growth mutual funds, namely <strong>Putnam Small Cap Growth </strong>PNSAX, <strong>T. Rowe Price Integrated US Small-Cap Growth Equity </strong>PRDSX and <strong>Congress Small Cap Growth Retail </strong>CSMVX. Each has earned a&nbsp;Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1&nbsp;(Strong Buy) and is expected to outperform its peers in the future. Investors can&nbsp;click here to see the complete list of funds.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Putnam Small Cap Growth </strong>invests the majority of its net assets in common stocks of small U.S. companies, focusing on growth stocks. Growth stocks are defined by the fund&rsquo;s advisors as stocks whose earnings are expected to grow faster than those of similar firms.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Putnam Small Cap Growth has a three-year annualized return of 4.8%. As of March 2024, PNSAX held 87 issues, with 3.5% of its assets invested in Super Micro Computers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>T. Rowe Price Integrated US Small-Cap Growth Equity </strong>invests the majority of its assets in common stocks of small-cap growth companies in the United States. It defines small-cap growth companies as those whose market capitalization, at the time of purchase, falls within the range of companies in the MSCI US Small Cap Growth Index.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">T. Rowe Price Integrated US Small-Cap Growth Equity has three-year annualized returns of 3.6%. PRDSX has an expense ratio of 0.80% compared with the category average of 1.03%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Congress Small Cap Growth Retail </strong>seeks long-term capital growth by investing most of its assets in common stocks of small-cap companies across all sectors of the economy. CSMVX advisors define small-cap companies as companies with market-cap equivalent to the companies listed in the Russell 2000 Growth Index at the time of purchase.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Congress Small Cap Growth Retail has a three-year annualized return of 5.1%. Gregg A. O&rsquo;Keefe has been one of the fund managers of CSMVX since September 2017.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To view the Zacks Rank and the past performance of all small-cap growth mutual funds, investors can&nbsp;click here to see the complete list of small-cap growth mutual funds.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Want key mutual fund info delivered straight to your inbox?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks&rsquo; free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing mutual funds, each week.&nbsp;Get it free &gt;&gt;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328020/3-small-cap-growth-mutual-funds-to-buy-for-solid-returns?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-best_of_funds-2328020">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Founded in 1993, Fuller &amp; Thaler Asset Management specializes in mutual funds that utilize finance principles. Fuller &amp; Thaler&#39;s emphasis on U.S. small-cap and mid-cap equities includes recognizing and exploiting market inefficiencies resulting from investor behavior, like reacting to negative news or not responding enough to positive developments. The approach adopted by Fuller &amp; Thaler sets its funds apart as they offer an investment strategy focusing on diversification and the potential, for long-term growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investing in Fuller &amp; Thaler mutual funds seems to be judicious as of now. Also, mutual funds, in general, diversify portfolios without several commission charges that are mainly associated with stock purchases and trim transaction costs (read more:&nbsp;Mutual Funds: Advantages, Disadvantages, and How They Make Investors Money).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We have, thus, chosen three Fuller &amp; Thaler mutual funds that investors should buy now for the long term. These funds possess a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), have positive three-year and five-year annualized returns, minimum initial investments within $5000, and expense ratios considerably lower than the category average. So, these funds have provided a comparatively strong performance along with lower fees.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fuller &amp; Thaler Behavioral Sm-Cp Gr Inv</strong>&nbsp;FTXNX&nbsp;aims to invest most of its net assets in small-cap companies based in the United States. FTXNX advisors may invest a small portion of the net assets in real estate investment trusts as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Frederick W. Stanske has been the lead manager of FTXNX since Dec. 20, 2017. Most of the fund&rsquo;s holdings were in companies like Super Micro Computer, Inc. (5.3%), e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (5.2%) and Vertiv Holdings Co (4.9%) as of March 31, 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">FTXNX&rsquo;s 3-year and 5-year annualized returns are 6.1% and 16.0%, respectively. FTXNX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1. Its net expense ratio is 1.25%</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To see how this fund performed compared to its category and other 1 and 2 Ranked Mutual Funds,&nbsp;please click here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fuller &amp; Thaler Behavioral Sm-Cp Eq Inv</strong>&nbsp;FTHNX&nbsp;seeks capital appreciation by investing most of its assets along with borrowings, if any, in small-cap U.S.-based companies. FTHNX advisors choose to invest in companies that are incorporated, headquartered and earn most of their revenues in the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Raife Giovinazzo has been the lead manager of FTHNX since Feb. 28, 2013. Most of the fund&rsquo;s holdings were in companies like EMCOR Group, Inc. (3.8%), Acuity Brands, Inc. (2.8%) and Commercial Metals Co (2.5%) as of March 31, 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">FTHNX&rsquo;s 3-year and 5-year annualized returns are 11.4% and 15%, respectively. FTHNX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1. Its net expense ratio is 1.06%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FullerThaler Behav Md-Cp Val Investor</strong>&nbsp;FTVNX&nbsp;invests most of its assets in mid-cap U.S. companies and real estate investment trusts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">David M. Potter has been the lead manager of FTVNX since Dec. 20, 2017. Most of the fund&rsquo;s holdings were in companies like Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (4.4%), First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (3.1%) and Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

Since then, the stock dropped over 15% and is now red for the year.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Investors might be tempted to buy the dip, but with the stock challenging 2024 lows, any market weakness could force another leg down.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>About the Company </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Charles Schwab was founded in 1971 and is headquartered in Westlake, Texas. The company&#39;s main subsidiaries include Charles Schwab &amp; Co.

The company guided revenue flat to 2% y/y and said FY24 expenses would grow 2% y/y. The company pointed to certain uncontrollable items such as the increase in the exchange processing fee rate, incremental FDIC special assessment, and accrual related to the industry-wide regulatory review of off-channel communications<em>.</em></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Schwab also reported that its net interest margin (NIM), which is a key measure of profitability for financial firms, was under pressure. This happened because higher interest rates caused clients to move funds from low-interest cash sweep accounts to higher-yielding investment products, reducing Schwab&rsquo;s ability to earn interest on client cash balances.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">With that, the company saw a reduction in cash balances and said it would pause its share buyback program to pay off debt.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Estimates Trending Lower</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Since the earnings report, analysts have started to cut their estimates and price targets.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For the current quarter, the estimates have dropped over the last 90 days, going from $0.87 to $0.75, or 14%.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The next quarter has seen a similar drop, with numbers falling from $0.93 to $0.83, or 10% over that same time frame.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Looking at next year over the last 90 days, analysts have dropped estimates by 9%, falling from $4.44 to $4.01.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">With the drop in estimates, there have been analyst price target cuts as well.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Piper/Sandler was the most recent, cutting its target to $64 from $80.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Technical Take</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">After earnings stock is traded near the 2024 lows at $59.67, which came in late January. For now, investors have defended that low after the earnings drop. However, any market weakness would likely take stops out below the $60 area.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">To show some progress, the bulls would need to back the 200-day MA at $68. The 50-day is attempting to breach that $68 level which would signal a &ldquo;Death Cross&rdquo;, which is extremely bearish.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If it starts to trend lower, the stock could fall to the $50-55 level, which was the support in late 2023.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>In Summary</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Charles Schwab is facing significant headwinds following its disappointing July earnings report. Despite being a strong player in the financial services industry, challenges like pressure on its net interest margin, declining cash balances, and pausing its share buyback program have caused analysts to cut estimates and price targets.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While some investors may be tempted to buy the dip, the stock&#39;s struggle to hold support at key technical levels, coupled with the possibility of a death cross, suggests caution. Any broader market weakness could lead to further downside, making it a risky bet in the near term.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For those interested in the space, a better option might be Interactive Brokers (IBKR). The stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that is coming off an earnings beat and is trading near all-time highs. &nbsp;</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2327921/bear-of-the-day-charles-schwab-schw?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-bear_of_the_day-2327921">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5CsE21OP-E?rel=0" width="560"></iframe><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Powell Industries (POWL) </strong>is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that provides custom-engineered equipment and systems for the management, distribution, and control of electrical energy.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">After breaking out earlier this year, POWL has seen some volatility but mostly traded sideways. More recently, the stock has made another push higher after a strong quarter and now looks to take out all-time highs.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>About the Company </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Powell Industries was founded in 1947 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas. The company&rsquo;s primary focus is on serving the energy, utilities, transportation, and industrial markets.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Powell designs and manufactures a range of products, including power control rooms, electrical enclosures, switchgear, and motor control centers, which are used in applications like power generation, distribution, and automation. The company serves customers globally, offering solutions that help ensure electrical systems are reliable, safe, and efficient, particularly for mission-critical infrastructure in industries such as oil and gas, utilities, and transportation.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The stock has Zacks Style Scores of &ldquo;B&rdquo; in both Growth and Value. The company has a market cap has a market cap of $2.3 billion and a Forward PE of 16. The stock also pays a small dividend of half a percent. &nbsp;</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Q3 Earnings Beat </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In late July, Powell posted a strong quarter, beating estimates by 79%. EPS came in at $3.79, which was up from $1.52 last year. Revenues came in at $255.1M v the $171.4M last year.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Net new orders were $235M, which was higher by 19%. The company had a backlog of $1.3B in the prior quarter and was able to keep that number at $1.3B after expanding its capacity. Management commented that excellent project execution improved gross margins by 510 basis points.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Investors loved the numbers and took the stock higher by over 25%. The stock did give most of the gains back during the early August market sell-off but has since made post-earnings highs.</span></span></p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Powell Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="Powell Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="266" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/7d/1724776586.png" title="" width="544" /> <p>Powell Industries, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Powell Industries, Inc. Quote</p></div><p><strong style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Estimates Spike Higher</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">After the earnings report, analysts were quick to lift numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For the current quarter, estimates have gone from $2.19 to $3.49. This is a 60% jump in just the last month.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">For the current year, estimates have been taken 33% higher, going from $9.04 to $12.01.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Looking longer term, estimates are pointing strongly higher. Over the last 90 days, numbers have been taken from $2.26 to $2.30, or 38%.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>The Technicals</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The stock broke higher, moving from $75 to $100, after reporting earnings in late January. It never looked back, powering its way up to the $200 level before pulling back to the $125 level.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">That $125 spot happened to be the 61.8% retracement, which started a rally into another strong quarter that took the stock to new highs at $209.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Once again, the stock pulled back in July to that $125 level, which happened to be the 200-day MA this time around.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The latest quarter brought the buyers back and the stock looks to take out the $209 high.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For those looking at Fibonacci levels, the 161.8% extension drawn from all-time highs to recent lows is $258. That target is another 40% higher than current trading levels.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Those looking for a pullback can focus on the 21-day moving average at $168 or the 50-day MA at $154.</span></span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Bottom Line </strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Powell Industries is an under-the-radar small-cap stock that is just getting started.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The company is hitting on all cylinders on the fundamental side and the chart looks great after the bulls took out the post-earnings highs.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While waiting for a pullback makes sense for some investors, the bulls seem to have strong momentum. POWL should hit all-time highs before its next earnings report and if they can repeat this quarter&#39;s performance, we should see a very strong finish into the end of the year.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2327886/bull-of-the-day-powell-industries-powl?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-bull_of_the_day-2327886">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Is American Century U.S. Quality Value ETF (VALQ) a Strong ETF Right Now? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Launched on 01/11/2018, the American Century U.S. Quality Value ETF (VALQ) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Style Box - All Cap Value category of the market.</p><p><h2>What Are Smart Beta ETFs?</h2></p><p>The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.</p><p>Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.</p><p>On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.</p><p>By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.</p><p>Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.</p><p><h2>Fund Sponsor & Index</h2></p><p>The fund is sponsored by American Century Investments. It has amassed assets over $235.21 million, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Value. Before fees and expenses, VALQ seeks to match the performance of the AMERICAN CENTURY U.S. QUALITY VALUE INDX.</p><p>The American Century U.S. Quality Value Index seeks to select securities of large and mid-capitalization companies that are undervalued or have sustainable income.</p><p><h2>Cost & Other Expenses</h2></p><p>Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.</p><p>Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.29% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.</p><p>It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.47%.</p><p><h2>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h2></p><p>While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p><p>This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 23.30% of the portfolio. Industrials and Consumer Staples round out the top three.</p><p>Looking at individual holdings, Walmart Inc Common Stock Usd.1 (WMT) accounts for about 2.86% of total assets, followed by Te Connectivity Ltd Common Stock Chf.57 (TEL) and Mckesson Corp Common Stock Usd.01 (MCK).</p><p>The top 10 holdings account for about 23.36% of total assets under management.</p><p><h2>Performance and Risk</h2></p><p>So far this year, VALQ has added about 14.41%, and is up roughly 23.81% in the last one year (as of 08/28/2024). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $46.59 and $60.30.</p><p>The ETF has a beta of 0.94 and standard deviation of 15.05% for the trailing three-year period. With about 230 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.</p><p><h2>Alternatives</h2></p><p>American Century U.S. Quality Value ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.</p><p>Dimensional U.S. Targeted Value ETF (DFAT) tracks ---------------------------------------- and the iShares Core S&P U.S. Value ETF (IUSV) tracks S&P 900 Value Index. Dimensional U.S. Targeted Value ETF has $10.57 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P U.S. Value ETF has $18.91 billion. DFAT has an expense ratio of 0.28% and IUSV charges 0.04%.</p><p>Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - All Cap Value.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328002/is-american-century-u-s-quality-value-etf-valq-a-strong-etf-right-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-smart_beta_etf-2328002">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>

<![CDATA[ Should Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF (IVOG) Be on Your Investing Radar? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 10:20:07 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>The Vanguard S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF (IVOG) was launched on 09/09/2010, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Mid Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.</p><p>The fund is sponsored by Vanguard. It has amassed assets over $1.06 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.</p><p><h2>Why Mid Cap Growth</h2></p><p>Compared to large and small cap companies, mid cap businesses tend to have higher growth prospects and are less volatile, respectively, with market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.</p><p>Qualities of growth stocks include faster growth rates compared to the broader market, as well as higher valuations and higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. Also, growth stocks are a type of equity that carries more risk compared to others. Even though growth stocks are more likely to outperform their value counterparts in strong bull markets, value stocks have a record of delivering better returns in almost all markets than growth stocks.</p><p><h2>Costs</h2></p><p>Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.</p><p>Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.</p><p>It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.99%.</p><p><h2>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h2></p><p>Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p><p>This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 29.20% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology round out the top three.</p><p>Looking at individual holdings, Carlisle Cos Inc (CSL) accounts for about 1.35% of total assets, followed by Williams-Sonoma Inc (WSM) and Lennox International Inc (LII).</p><p>The top 10 holdings account for about 8.7% of total assets under management.</p><p><h2>Performance and Risk</h2></p><p>IVOG seeks to match the performance of the S&P MidCap 400 Growth Index before fees and expenses.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>If you're interested in broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, look no further than the Invesco S&P MidCap 400 GARP ETF (GRPM), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/03/2010.</p><p>The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $503.87 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.</p><p><h2>Why Mid Cap Blend</h2></p><p>Mid cap companies, with market capitalization in the range of $2 billion and $10 billion, offer investors many things that small and large companies don't, including less risk and higher growth opportunities. Thus, companies that fall under this category provide a stable and growth-heavy investment.</p><p>Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.</p><p><h2>Costs</h2></p><p>Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.</p><p>Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.35%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.</p><p>It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.78%.</p><p><h2>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h2></p><p>Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p><p>This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector--about 27% of the portfolio. Energy and Industrials round out the top three.</p><p>Looking at individual holdings, Lantheus Holdings Inc (LNTH) accounts for about 3.84% of total assets, followed by Roivant Sciences Ltd (ROIV) and Kinsale Capital Group Inc (KNSL).</p><p>The top 10 holdings account for about 24.88% of total assets under management.</p><p><h2>Performance and Risk</h2></p><p>GRPM seeks to match the performance of the S&P MIDCAP 400 GARP INDEX before fees and expenses. The S&P MidCap 400 GARP Index seeks to track companies with consistent fundamental growth, reasonable valuation, solid financial strength, and strong earning power.</p><p>The ETF has added roughly 19.61% so far this year and is up about 0% in the last one year (as of 08/28/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $82.10 and $123.17.</p><p>The ETF has a beta of 1.20. With about 60 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.</p><p><h2>Alternatives</h2></p><p>Invesco S&P MidCap 400 GARP ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GRPM is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.</p><p>The Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (IJH) track a similar index. While Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF has $67.54 billion in assets, iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF has $89.25 billion. VO has an expense ratio of 0.04% and IJH charges 0.05%.</p><p><h2>Bottom-Line</h2></p><p>An increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.</p><p>To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328004/should-invesco-s-p-midcap-400-garp-etf-grpm-be-on-your-investing-radar?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-style_box_etf-2328004">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Should First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX ETF (FEX) Be on Your Investing Radar? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Launched on 05/08/2007, the First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX ETF (FEX) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.</p><p>The fund is sponsored by First Trust Advisors. It has amassed assets over $1.27 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.</p><p><h2>Why Large Cap Blend</h2></p><p>Companies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.</p><p>Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.</p><p><h2>Costs</h2></p><p>Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.</p><p>Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.60%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.</p><p>It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.15%.</p><p><h2>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h2></p><p>Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p><p>This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 17.40% of the portfolio. Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.</p><p>Looking at individual holdings, D.r. Horton, Inc. (DHI) accounts for about 0.54% of total assets, followed by Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM) and Howmet Aerospace Inc. (HWM).</p><p>The top 10 holdings account for about 5.09% of total assets under management.</p><p><h2>Performance and Risk</h2></p><p>FEX seeks to match the performance of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Large Cap Core Index before fees and expenses. The NASDAQ AlphaDEX Large Cap Core Index is an enhanced index which employs the AlphaDEX stock selection methodology to select stocks from the NASDAQ US 500 Large Cap Index.</p><p>The ETF has added roughly 13.19% so far this year and is up about 23.82% in the last one year (as of 08/28/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $76.85 and $101.59.</p><p>The ETF has a beta of 1.05 and standard deviation of 16.94% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 376 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.</p><p><h2>Alternatives</h2></p><p>First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, FEX is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.</p><p>The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $518.92 billion in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $567.76 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.</p><p><h2>Bottom-Line</h2></p><p>Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Designed to provide broad exposure to the Style Box - All Cap Blend category of the market, the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF (QUAL) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 07/16/2013.</p><p><h2>What Are Smart Beta ETFs?</h2></p><p>The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.</p><p>Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.</p><p>On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.</p><p>Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.</p><p>While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.</p><p><h2>Fund Sponsor & Index</h2></p><p>The fund is managed by Blackrock, and has been able to amass over $49.10 billion, which makes it one of the largest ETFs in the Style Box - All Cap Blend. QUAL seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Sector Neutral Quality Index before fees and expenses.</p><p>The MSCI USA Sector Neutral Quality Index is based on a traditional market capitalization-weighted parent index, the MSCI USA Index which includes U.S. large and mid capitalization stocks.</p><p><h2>Cost & Other Expenses</h2></p><p>Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.</p><p>Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.15% for this ETF, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.</p><p>The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1%.</p><p><h2>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h2></p><p>ETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p><p>This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Information Technology sector - about 31% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.</p><p>Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 5.69% of total assets, followed by Nvidia Corp (NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).</p><p>QUAL's top 10 holdings account for about 39.91% of its total assets under management.</p><p><h2>Performance and Risk</h2></p><p>So far this year, QUAL has added about 21.30%, and is up about 32.05% in the last one year (as of 08/28/2024). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $127.66 and $177.76.</p><p>QUAL has a beta of 1.03 and standard deviation of 18.63% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 129 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.</p><p><h2>Alternatives</h2></p><p>IShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - All Cap Blend segment of the market.

The Oil & Gas Exploration Index is a modified equal weight index.</p><p><h2>Costs</h2></p><p>When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.</p><p>Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.35%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.</p><p>It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.42%.</p><p><h2>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h2></p><p>Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p><p>This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Energy sector--about 100% of the portfolio.</p><p>Looking at individual holdings, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) accounts for about 3.25% of total assets, followed by Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG) and Eog Resources Inc (EOG).</p><p>The top 10 holdings account for about 30.65% of total assets under management.</p><p><h2>Performance and Risk</h2></p><p>So far this year, XOP has gained about 2.12%, and is down about -2.97% in the last one year (as of 08/28/2024). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $128.16 and $160.59.</p><p>The ETF has a beta of 1.70 and standard deviation of 34.60% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high risk choice in the space. With about 56 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.</p><p><h2>Alternatives</h2></p><p>SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, XOP is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Energy ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.</p><p>Invesco Energy Exploration & Production ETF (PXE) tracks Dynamic Energy Exploration & Production Intellidex Index and the iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (IEO) tracks Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration & Production Index.

<![CDATA[ Should You Invest in the First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX ETF (FXG)? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>If you're interested in broad exposure to the Consumer Staples - Broad segment of the equity market, look no further than the First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX ETF (FXG), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 05/08/2007.</p><p>While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.</p><p>Additionally, sector ETFs offer convenient ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Consumer Staples - Broad is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 10, placing it in bottom 38%.</p><p><h2>Index Details</h2></p><p>The fund is sponsored by First Trust Advisors. It has amassed assets over $417.89 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Consumer Staples - Broad segment of the equity market. FXG seeks to match the performance of the StrataQuant Consumer Staples Index before fees and expenses.</p><p>The StrataQuant Consumer Staples Index is a modified equal-dollar weighted index designed by the AMEX to objectively identify and select stocks from the Russell 1000 Index that may generate positive alpha relative to traditional passive style indices through the use of the AlphaDEX screening methodology.</p><p><h2>Costs</h2></p><p>When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.</p><p>Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.63%, making it the most expensive product in the space.</p><p>It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.40%.</p><p><h2>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h2></p><p>ETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p><p>This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Consumer Staples sector--about 89.80% of the portfolio, followed by Healthcare.</p><p>Looking at individual holdings, Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC) accounts for about 4.69% of total assets, followed by Molson Coors Beverage Company (TAP) and Freshpet, Inc. (FRPT).</p><p>The top 10 holdings account for about 39.71% of total assets under management.</p><p><h2>Performance and Risk</h2></p><p>The ETF has added about 8.46% so far this year and is up about 9.78% in the last one year (as of 08/28/2024). In that past 52-week period, it has traded between $57.04 and $68.49.</p><p>The ETF has a beta of 0.65 and standard deviation of 13.57% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 41 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.</p><p><h2>Alternatives</h2></p><p>First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX ETF sports a Zacks ETF Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. FXG, then, is not a suitable option for investors seeking exposure to the Consumer Staples ETFs segment of the market. Instead, there are better ETFs in the space to consider.</p><p>Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC) tracks MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 25/50 Index and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) tracks Consumer Staples Select Sector Index. Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF has $7.08 billion in assets, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF has $17.14 billion. VDC has an expense ratio of 0.10% and XLP charges 0.09%.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328006/should-you-invest-in-the-first-trust-consumer-staples-alphadex-etf-fxg?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-sector_etf-2328006">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Launched on 12/16/2015, the Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF (DJD) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.</p><p>The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $309.84 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.</p><p><h2>Why Large Cap Blend</h2></p><p>Companies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.</p><p>Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.</p><p><h2>Costs</h2></p><p>Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.</p><p>Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.07%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.</p><p>It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.42%.</p><p><h2>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h2></p><p>While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p><p>This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 17.50% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.</p><p>Looking at individual holdings, 3m Co (MMM) accounts for about 12.40% of total assets, followed by Verizon Communications Inc (VZ) and Dow Inc (DOW).</p><p>The top 10 holdings account for about 63.19% of total assets under management.</p><p><h2>Performance and Risk</h2></p><p>DJD seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Yield Weighted index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average Yield Weighted Index provides exposure to high-yielding equity securities in the Dow Jones Industrial Average by their 12-month dividend yield over the prior 12 months.</p><p>The ETF has gained about 11.78% so far this year and is up about 22.28% in the last one year (as of 08/28/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $39.87 and $51.02.</p><p>The ETF has a beta of 0.81 and standard deviation of 13.95% for the trailing three-year period. With about 29 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.</p><p><h2>Alternatives</h2></p><p>Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, DJD is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.</p><p>The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $518.92 billion in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $567.76 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.</p><p><h2>Bottom-Line</h2></p><p>Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.</p><p>To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328011/should-invesco-dow-jones-industrial-average-dividend-etf-djd-be-on-your-investing-radar?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-style_box_etf-2328011">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Launched on 06/16/2017, the Pacer US Small Cap Cash Cows 100 ETF (CALF) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market.</p><p>The fund is sponsored by Pacer Etfs. It has amassed assets over $9.25 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Value segment of the US equity market.</p><p><h2>Why Small Cap Value</h2></p><p>There's a lot of potential to investing in small cap companies, but with market capitalization below $2 billion, that high potential comes with even higher risk.</p><p>Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.</p><p><h2>Costs</h2></p><p>When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.</p><p>Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.59%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.</p><p>It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.08%.</p><p><h2>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h2></p><p>While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p><p>This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector--about 31.10% of the portfolio. Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.</p><p>Looking at individual holdings, Mueller Industries Inc (MLI) accounts for about 2.43% of total assets, followed by Newell Brands Inc (NWL) and Hanesbrands Inc (HBI).</p><p>The top 10 holdings account for about 19.72% of total assets under management.</p><p><h2>Performance and Risk</h2></p><p>CALF seeks to match the performance of the Pacer US Small Cap Cash Cows Index before fees and expenses. The Pacer US Small Cap Cash Cows Index uses an objective, rules-based methodology to provide exposure to small-capitalization U.S. companies with high free cash flow yields.</p><p>The ETF has lost about -3.93% so far this year and was up about 11.28% in the last one year (as of 08/28/2024). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $39.26 and $49.16.</p><p>The ETF has a beta of 1.20 and standard deviation of 24.56% for the trailing three-year period. With about 102 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.</p><p><h2>Alternatives</h2></p><p>Pacer US Small Cap Cash Cows 100 ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, CALF is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Small Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.</p><p>The Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (AVUV) and the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR) track a similar index. While Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF has $13.03 billion in assets, Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF has $29.86 billion. AVUV has an expense ratio of 0.25% and VBR charges 0.07%.</p><p><h2>Bottom-Line</h2></p><p>An increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.</p><p>To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328010/should-pacer-us-small-cap-cash-cows-100-etf-calf-be-on-your-investing-radar?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-style_box_etf-2328010">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>A smart beta exchange traded fund, the SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF (ONEV) debuted on 12/02/2015, and offers broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend category of the market.</p><p><h2>What Are Smart Beta ETFs?</h2></p><p>Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy.</p><p>Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.</p><p>However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.</p><p>Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.</p><p>Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.</p><p><h2>Fund Sponsor & Index</h2></p><p>The fund is managed by State Street Global Advisors, and has been able to amass over $681.27 million, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Blend. ONEV seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index before fees and expenses.</p><p>The Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index reflects the performance of a segment of large-capitalization U.S. equity securities demonstrating a combination of core factors high value, high quality, and low size characteristics, with a focus factor comprising low volatility characteristics.</p><p><h2>Cost & Other Expenses</h2></p><p>For ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.</p><p>Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.20% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.</p><p>It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.66%.</p><p><h2>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h2></p><p>It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p><p>ONEV's heaviest allocation is in the Industrials sector, which is about 18.80% of the portfolio. Its Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.</p><p>When you look at individual holdings, Cognizant Tech Solutions A (CTSH) accounts for about 1.45% of the fund's total assets, followed by Bristol Myers Squibb Co (BMY) and Humana Inc (HUM).</p><p>The top 10 holdings account for about 9.5% of total assets under management.</p><p><h2>Performance and Risk</h2></p><p>The ETF has added about 12.12% and is up roughly 20.37% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 08/28/2024), respectively. ONEV has traded between $99.61 and $127.46 during this last 52-week period.</p><p>ONEV has a beta of 0.97 and standard deviation of 15.41% for the trailing three-year period. With about 434 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.</p><p><h2>Alternatives</h2></p><p>SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.</p><p>IShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) tracks S&P 500 Index and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) tracks S&P 500 Index. IShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $518.92 billion in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $567.76 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.</p><p>Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Blend.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328015/is-spdr-russell-1000-low-volatility-focus-etf-onev-a-strong-etf-right-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-smart_beta_etf-2328015">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Launched on 02/23/2011, the SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend ETF (EDIV) is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Broad Emerging Market ETFs category of the market.</p><p><h2>What Are Smart Beta ETFs?</h2></p><p>The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.</p><p>Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.</p><p>On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.</p><p>Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.</p><p>The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.</p><p><h2>Fund Sponsor & Index</h2></p><p>The fund is sponsored by State Street Global Advisors. It has amassed assets over $472.75 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Broad Emerging Market ETFs. EDIV seeks to match the performance of the S&P Emerging Markets Dividend Opportunities Index before fees and expenses.</p><p>The S&P Emerging Markets Dividend Opportunities Index includes 100 tradable, exchange-listed common stocks from emerging market countries that offer high dividend yields.</p><p><h2>Cost & Other Expenses</h2></p><p>For ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.</p><p>Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.49% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.</p><p>The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.28%.</p><p><h2>Sector Exposure and Top Holdings</h2></p><p>Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.</p><p>Taking into account individual holdings, Banco Bradesco Adr (BBD) accounts for about 3.59% of the fund's total assets, followed by Cia Energetica Minas Ger Prf (CMIG4) and Telkom Indonesia Persero Tbk (TLKM).</p><p>The top 10 holdings account for about 25.09% of total assets under management.</p><p><h2>Performance and Risk</h2></p><p>So far this year, EDIV return is roughly 15.11%, and is up about 27.49% in the last one year (as of 08/28/2024). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $28.75 and $36.80.</p><p>EDIV has a beta of 0.68 and standard deviation of 14.36% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a medium risk choice in the space. With about 140 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.</p><p><h2>Alternatives</h2></p><p>SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Broad Emerging Market ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.</p><p>Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) tracks FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap China A Inclusion Index and the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) tracks MSCI Emerging Markets Investable Market Index. Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF has $79.26 billion in assets, iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF has $80.47 billion. VWO has an expense ratio of 0.08% and IEMG charges 0.09%.</p><p>Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Broad Emerging Market ETFs.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328014/is-spdr-s-p-emerging-markets-dividend-etf-ediv-a-strong-etf-right-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-smart_beta_etf-2328014">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Chevron-Led Group Faces Deadline for Aphrodite Gas Project ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 10:20:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">A consortium led by U.S.-based <strong>Chevron Corporation</strong> CVX, an integrated oil and gas company, is facing pressure to submit a revised development plan for its gas field of the coast of Cyprus. The group, which holds the licensing rights for the Aphrodite field, has been given a three-month deadline by the Cypriot government to make the necessary revisions.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Overview of the Aphrodite Gas Field</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Cyprus&#39;s Aphrodite gas field, a significant energy discovery in the Eastern Mediterranean, was discovered in 2011. Located southeast of the island, the field holds an estimated 3.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. As the region&#39;s energy landscape evolves, the development of this field has become increasingly important for both Cyprus and the involved international consortium. However, the country has since made additional gas discoveries in four other areas, all of which remain untapped.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Chevron-led Consortium and its Role</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A Chevron-led consortium, which includes Israel&#39;s NewMed Energy and BG Cyprus Ltd., a subsidiary of <strong>Shell plc</strong> SHEL, holds the licensing rights to the Aphrodite field. The consortium is tasked with developing the field, a project that has seen numerous delays and negotiations, following Chevron&#39;s acquisition of Noble Energy in 2020. Noble Energy had initially agreed on a field development plan with Cyprus in 2019, but changes proposed by Chevron have led to extended discussions and adjustments to the original plan.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Cypriot Government&#39;s Ultimatum: A Three-Month Deadline</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In a recent development, the Cypriot government issued a &quot;notice of breach&quot; to the consortium on Aug. 25, 2024. This notice grants the consortium a three-month deadline to submit an updated development plan and initiate the Front-End Engineering Design (&ldquo;FEED&rdquo;) process. The FEED process is a critical step in the project, allowing for a detailed assessment of the engineering and cost aspects of the field&#39;s development.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Implications of the Government&#39;s Notice</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Cypriot government&#39;s ultimatum highlights the commitment to advancing the energy program within the framework of the contract. Failure to meet this deadline could result in the termination of the contract, which would be a significant setback for the consortium. The urgency of the situation reflects the strategic importance of the Aphrodite field to Cyprus&#39;s energy security and economic future.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Chevron&#39;s Strategic Position in the Eastern Mediterranean</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Chevron&#39;s involvement in the Aphrodite field is part of its broader strategy in the Eastern Mediterranean, a region that has emerged as a vital hub for natural gas exploration and production. The company&#39;s acquisition of Noble Energy and by extension, its stake in the Aphrodite field, signals CVX&rsquo;s commitment to expanding its presence in this energy-rich region. The successful development of the Aphrodite field would not only strengthen Chevron&#39;s portfolio but also strengthen its influence in the Eastern Mediterranean&#39;s energy dynamics.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Challenges in the Development of the Aphrodite Field</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The development of the Aphrodite field has faced several challenges, from technical complexities to geopolitical tension in the region. The proposed changes to the 2019 development plan by CVX have also contributed to delays, requiring extensive negotiations with the Cypriot government and the other consortium partners. The volatile nature of global energy markets and the increasing focus on renewable energy sources have added layers of complexity to the project&#39;s execution.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Technical and Environmental Considerations</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Developing an offshore gas field like Aphrodite involves intricate technical operations, including deepwater drilling and the construction of subsea infrastructure. Environmental concerns also play a significant role, with stringent regulations in place to ensure that the development minimizes its impact on the surrounding marine ecosystem. The FEED process will be crucial in addressing these challenges, providing a detailed blueprint for the project&#39;s execution.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">The Future of the Aphrodite Gas Field</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As the Chevron-led consortium prepares to submit its updated development plan, the future of the Aphrodite gas field hangs in the balance. Meeting the Cypriot government&#39;s deadline is important for the continuation of the project, which has the potential to transform Cyprus into a key player in the regional energy market. The field&#39;s development could also have broader implications for energy security in the Eastern Mediterranean, in the context of Europe&rsquo;s efforts to diversify the continent&rsquo;s energy sources.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strategic Importance for Cyprus and the Region</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For Cyprus, the successful development of the Aphrodite field is more than just an economic opportunity. This represents a strategic asset that can enhance the country&#39;s energy security and geopolitical influence. The gas produced from the field could be exported to the markets in Europe, reducing the region&#39;s reliance on energy imports from less stable regions.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The next three months will be a critical period for both the Chevron-led consortium and the Cypriot government. The outcome of this ultimatum will determine the future of the Aphrodite gas field and its role in the region&#39;s energy landscape. As the consortium works to meet the deadline, the decisions made in this period will have long-lasting implications for all stakeholders involved.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, CVX and SHEL carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the energy sector might look at some better-ranked stocks like <strong>SM Energy Company </strong>SM, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and&nbsp;<strong>TechnipFMC plc </strong>FTI, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), at present. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Denver, CO-based SM Energy is valued at $5.37 billion. The company currently pays a dividend of 72 cents per share, or 1.53%, on an annual basis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SM, an independent energy company, engages in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil, gas and natural gas liquids in the state of Texas.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TechnipFMC is valued at $11.48 billion. The company currently pays a dividend of 20 cents per share, or 0.75%, on an annual basis.</p><div><p style="text-align: justify;">TechnipFMC plc engages in energy projects, technologies and systems and services businesses in Europe, Central Asia, North America, Latin America, the Asia Pacific, Africa, the Middle East and internationally. It operates through two segments: Subsea and Surface Technologies.</p></div><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2328037/chevron-led-group-faces-deadline-for-aphrodite-gas-project?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_energy_sector-2328037">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 5 Value Stocks With Exciting EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Scoop Up ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 10:16:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Investors generally tend to cling to the price-to-earnings (P/E) metric while looking for bargain stocks. In addition to being a widely used tool for screening stocks, P/E is also a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a company. But even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few downsides.<br /><br />While P/E is by far the most popular equity valuation ratio, a more complicated metric called EV-to-EBITDA does a better job of valuing a firm. Often viewed as a better substitute to P/E, this ratio offers a clearer picture of a company&rsquo;s valuation and its earnings potential.<br /><br /><strong>KT Corporation</strong> KT, <strong>Hamilton Insurance Group, Ltd.</strong> HG, <strong>EZCORP, Inc.</strong> EZPW, <strong>Financial Institutions, Inc.</strong> FISI and <strong>The Greenbrier Companies, Inc.</strong> GBX are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.</p><h2>Is EV-to-EBITDA a Better Substitute to P/E?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">EV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company&rsquo;s market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents. EBITDA, the other component, gives a better idea of a company&rsquo;s profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.<br /><br />The lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more enticing it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio indicates that a stock is potentially undervalued. EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company&rsquo;s balance sheet that the P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.<br /><br />Another shortcoming of P/E is that it can&rsquo;t be used to value a loss-making firm. A company&rsquo;s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value loss-making but EBITDA-positive companies. EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful yardstick in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. It can also be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.<br /><br />EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of limitations and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock&rsquo;s inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.<br /><br />A strategy solely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. You can club it with the other major ratios in your stock-investing toolbox, such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks.</p><h2>Screening Criteria</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are the parameters to screen for value stocks:<br /><br /><strong>EV-to-EBITDA 12 Months-Most Recent less than X-Industry Median:</strong> A lower EV-to-EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation.<br /><br /><strong>P/E using (F1) less than X-Industry Median: </strong>This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers.<br /><br /><strong>P/B less than X-Industry Median: </strong>A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued.<br /><br /><strong>P/S less than X-Industry Median:</strong> The lower the P/S ratio, the more attractive the stock is, as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company.<br /><br /><strong>Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than or equal to X-Industry Median: </strong>This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: </strong>The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily.<br /><br /><strong>Current Price greater than or equal to $5:</strong> This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of $5 or higher.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2:</strong> It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Value Score of less than or equal to B: </strong>Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are our five picks out of the 10 stocks that passed the screen:<br /><br /><strong>KT</strong> is the biggest telecommunications operator in the Republic of Korea. This Zacks Rank #1 stock has a Value Score of A.<br /><br />KT has an expected earnings growth rate of 20% for 2024.

<![CDATA[ Petrobras, Helix Ink Lucrative $786M Well Intervention Deals ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 10:01:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Petrobras</strong> PBR, a leading energy company in Brazil, and <strong>Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc.</strong> HLX, a Houston-based provider of oil and gas equipment and services, signed new three-year charter and service contracts for the Siem Helix 1 and Siem Helix 2 vessels. These advanced, riser-based well-intervention vessels will operate in offshore Brazil, with the contracts valued at approximately $786 million. This move continues the companies&rsquo; longstanding partnership, ensuring that the energy needs in the Santos and Campos Basins are addressed with cutting-edge and efficient solutions.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Details of the Contracts</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Scope of the Contracts: </strong>These contracts cover a comprehensive range of services, including production enhancement, well decommissioning, subsea installation, offshore crane operations and Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) operations. These deals were awarded after a competitive tender process, underscoring the value and trust PBR places in Helix&rsquo;s capabilities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Duration and Extension Options: </strong>The contracts span an initial three years, with the option for an additional three-year extension. This flexibility allows both companies to adapt to the dynamic needs of the offshore energy market, ensuring that the collaboration can evolve with emerging technologies and market demand.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Financial Impact: </strong>The contracts&#39; estimated value is a substantial $786 million, reflecting the high demand for reliable and efficient well intervention services in Brazil. This financial commitment not only highlights the strategic importance of these vessels but also highlights Helix&#39;s position as a leader in the global well-intervention market.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Advanced Well-Intervention Vessels</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Siem Helix 1: A Proven Performer</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Siem Helix 1 has a track record of excellence, having previously worked for PBR from April 2017 to July 2021. In this period, the vessel completed 74 well interventions in the Santos and Campos Basins, demonstrating its reliability and efficiency in the field. The vessel&#39;s return to PBR&rsquo;s service marks a continuation of its legacy of high performance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Siem Helix 2: A Pillar of Offshore Operations</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2017, the Siem Helix 2 has been instrumental in performing riser-based well-intervention activities for PBR. Operating in the Santos and Campos Basins, this vessel has completed more than 100 well interventions to date. The vessel&rsquo;s consistent performance and advanced capabilities have made it a cornerstone of PBR&#39;s offshore operations.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Capabilities of the Vessels</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Siem Helix 1 and Siem Helix 2 are purpose-built vessels designed to handle a wide range of subsea services, including optimizing existing well outputs to maximize production efficiency, safely retiring and sealing wells that are no longer productive, installing subsea infrastructure critical for offshore energy production, supporting various construction and maintenance activities in deepwater environments through offshore crane and ROV operations and providing rapid response capabilities in the event of an offshore incident.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strategic Importance of the Contracts</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Strengthening the PBR-HLX Relationship: </strong>These contracts further strengthen the long-standing relationship between PBR and Helix. In the past seven years, HLX has consistently delivered safe and cost-effective well-intervention services to PBR, reinforcing the trust and collaboration between the two companies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Supporting Petrobras&#39; Energy Transition Goals:</strong> HLX&#39;s commitment to innovation and tailored solutions aligns with PBR&rsquo;s broader energy transition goals. By optimizing production from existing assets, these contracts contribute to a more sustainable and efficient energy future for Brazil<strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Competitive Edge in the Offshore Market: </strong>The award of these contracts following a competitive tender process highlights Helix&#39;s competitive edge in the offshore market. The company&#39;s extensive global experience in well intervention, combined with its advanced fleet, positions HLX as a preferred partner for major energy companies like PBR.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Prospects and Opportunities</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Potential for Contract Extensions: </strong>With the option for an additional three years, there is significant potential for the continuation of this partnership beyond the initial contract period. This provides both companies with the opportunity to build on its existing success and explore new avenues for collaboration.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Expanding Helix&#39;s Presence in Brazil: </strong>Successfully executing these contracts could open doors for HLX to increase its presence in the offshore market of Brazil. As PBR continues to develop its offshore assets, there may be further opportunities for HLX to provide advanced well-intervention services.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Technological Advancements and Innovation: </strong>As the offshore energy sector evolves, Helix&#39;s commitment to innovation will be crucial in maintaining its competitive advantage. The company&rsquo;s focus on developing new technologies and improving operational efficiencies will be key to meeting the challenges in the future.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">PBR&rsquo;s decision to renew and expand the partnership with HLX highlights the company&rsquo;s strategic commitment to enhancing its well-intervention capabilities. These contracts are expected to deliver significant benefits to the company in terms of operational efficiency, cost optimization, risk mitigation, technological advancement and strengthened partnership.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, PBR and HLX carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the energy sector might look at some better-ranked stocks like <strong>SM Energy Company </strong>SM, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) &nbsp;and <strong>MPLX LP</strong> MPLX, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), at present.

<![CDATA[ <h3 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Releases</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; August 28, 2024 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL, Carnival Corp. &amp; plc CCL, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCLH and J.P. Morgan JPM.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Here are highlights from Wednesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>3 Cruise Line Stocks Promising Near-Term Growth: RCL, CCL and NCLH</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The cruise industry is benefiting from strong demand and increased booking volumes. Solid bookings concerning North American and European sailings are driving the space. Also, strong pricing (on closer-in-demand) and solid onboard spending bode well for the industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in cruise line operators with a favorable Zacks Rank. A few such operators have strong upside left. Three among them are <strong>Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.</strong>, <strong>Carnival Corp. &amp; plc</strong> and <strong>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.</strong></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Strong Demand for Cruise Liners</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the number of passengers embarking on cruises is projected to reach 35.7 million in 2024, suggesting an increase from 31.5 million in 2023. The projection calls for a 6% rise from the 2019 figures, reflecting the cruising industry&rsquo;s upside.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cruise operators are investing in new hardware, including mega-ships and private destinations, to acquire new customers. <strong>J.P. Morgan </strong>Research estimates the cruise industry to capture approximately 3.8% of the $1.9 trillion global vacation market by 2028.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">3 Top Cruise Line Stock Picks</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">We have narrowed our search to three big cruise liners that have strong potential for the rest of 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks currently carries a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Solid Earnings Estimate Revisions for RCL Stock</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. posted impressive second-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. RCL has been benefiting from strong cruising demand from new and loyal guests and robust booking trends. Also, strength in consumer spending onboard and pre-cruise purchases bodes well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">RCL emphasized investing in a modern digital travel platform to streamline the vacation booking process for customers and expand wallet share. Moreover, RCL emphasized new innovative ships and onboard experiences to boost its offering and deliver superior yields and margins.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank #1 Royal Caribbean Cruises has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 18.1% and 69.9%, respectively, for the current year. The stock has seen positive earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter, current year and next year in the last 30 days.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Strong Price Upside for RCL Shares</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past three months, RCL shares provided a return of 9.2%. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 14.2% from the last closing price of $162.05. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $154-$210.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">CCL Shares See Solid Earnings Estimate Revisions</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Carnival Corp. &amp; plc reported impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This was driven by sustained demand strength and increased booking volumes at significantly higher prices. CCL reported strong booking momentum for 2025, with record volumes surpassing the 2024 levels in price and occupancy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CCL&rsquo;s focus on marketing campaigns and fleet-optimization efforts, along with fleet expansion initiatives is encouraging. Given the uptrend, CCL raised its fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS expectations to $1.18 from the previous expectation of $0.98.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank #2 Carnival has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending November 2024).

The brokerage target stock price is currently in the range of $15-$27.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">NCLH Stock Earnings Surpass Expectations</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. reported solid second-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. NCLH is benefiting from strong demand, high pricing and increased booking volumes, leading to record advance ticket sales.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NCLH&rsquo;s focus on fleet expansion efforts and digital initiatives bodes well. These factors showcase that the company&rsquo;s strategy is well-aligned with its growth goals and 2026 financial and sustainability targets. Given the substantial progress made so far and current demand expectations, NCLH raised its 2024 full-year guidance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank #1 Norwegian Cruise Line has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.8% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year. The stock has seen positive earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter, next quarter, current year and next year in the last 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past three months, NCLH stock provided a return of 9.1%.

<![CDATA[ <h3 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Releases</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; August 28, 2024 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Toyota Motor Corp. TM, IBM Corp. IBM and Stryker Corp. SYK and Fossil Group, Inc. FOSL.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Here are highlights from Wednesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Top Stock Reports for Toyota, IBM and Stryker</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today&#39;s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Toyota Motor Corp., IBM Corp. and Stryker Corp., as well a micro-cap stock Fossil Group, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can <strong>see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Toyota Motor </strong>shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past year (+8.0% vs. -9.1%). The company&rsquo;s robust lineup of trucks and sport utility vehicles is set to fuel sales. To capitalize on the global shift to environment-friendly vehicles, the auto giant is deepening its focus on manufacturing hybrid, electric and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, which will bolster the company&rsquo;s product competitiveness.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It aims to expand global sales of BEVs to 1.5 million units in 2026 and 3.5 million units a year by 2030. Toyota&rsquo;s commitment to maximizing shareholders&rsquo; value via dividends and buybacks is also praiseworthy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, labor cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on margins. Rising debt levels, along with high R&amp;D expenses and capex, might pose challenges. Also, Toyota expects sales in Japan to decrease, given the lower shipments of Daihatsu. Thus, the stock warrants a cautious stance now.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(You can <strong>read the full research report on Toyota Motor here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>IBM</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+41.0% vs. +32.2%). The company is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in Software and Consulting. Its growth is expected to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing, and security in the long haul.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investment in growth opportunities will likely drive profitability. The infrastructure segment is benefiting from broad-based demand for hybrid and distributed infrastructure, especially IBM Z. Improved cybersecurity operations will likely bring long-term benefits.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, net sales in the Consulting segment are impacted by a pullback in discretionary spending. Although IBM generates significant cash flow, a high debt level can jeopardize its ability to sustain dividend payout. Fierce competition remains a concern.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(You can <strong>read the full research report on IBM here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stryker</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+28.6% vs. +15.8%). The company exited second-quarter 2024 on a strong note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company witnessed strong performance across its segments in the United States. Strong International sales also buoy optimism.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The momentum is expected to continue in 2024 on the back of ongoing procedural recovery and a strong order book for capital equipment. Stryker&rsquo;s prospects in 2024 seem promising on the back of strong customer demand for its existing products as well as new launches. The company&rsquo;s guidance for earnings and revenues appears encouraging. A solid solvency position is a plus.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, inflationary pressure and supply-chain challenges continue to plague Stryker. Stiff competition in the MedTech space remains a woe. Contraction in both gross and operating margin is a woe.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(You can <strong>read the full research report on Stryker here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>Fossil&rsquo;s</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry over the past six months (+8.6% vs. -0.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $62.17 million have seen gross margin expanded by 340 bps for the 26 weeks ended June 29, 2024, driven by SKU rationalization, pricing adjustments and exiting the lower-margin smartwatch category under the TAG Plan.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further margin expansion is anticipated in the second half of 2024. The company also reduced SG&amp;A expenses by 19.1%, narrowing the adjusted operating loss by 32% year over year, and is on track to achieve $100 million in annualized benefits. Fossil&#39;s liquidity improved to $156 million, aided by a $57 million tax refund and a 38% reduction in inventory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strategic exits from the smartwatch category and store closures have optimized operations, contributing to gross margin gains. Despite these positives, net sales declined 20% due to strategic shifts, with a $100 million negative impact expected for the full year. Pressure on licensed watch brands and high debt levels present ongoing challenges.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">(You can <strong>read the full research report on Fossil here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.0 average gain per year.

<![CDATA[ <h3 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Releases</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; August 28, 2024 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Intel Corp. INTC and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Here are highlights from Wednesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Why Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Is Offering Handsome Returns</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Super Micro Computer Inc. </strong>has benefited on the back of robust demand for servers powered by high-end generative artificial intelligence (AI) chipsets. SMCI designs, develops, manufactures and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">An astonishing rise in demand for high-performance rack servers boosted SMCI&rsquo;s top and bottom lines. The stock price of SMCI has soared more than 98% this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In order to support aggressive workloads, data centers are aggressively demanding high-density rack space and direct-to-chip liquid cooling. Super Micro Computer makes servers for enterprise, cloud, AI, metaverse and 5G telco/edge IT infrastructure. Super Micro Computer is positioned as a leading provider of one-stop-shop, high-performance rack servers capable of powering advanced AI applications.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Robust Clientele of SMCI</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the largest customers of SMCI include <strong>NVIDIA Corp.</strong>, <strong>Intel Corp.</strong> and <strong>Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</strong> The company is a big beneficiary of the booming AI-empowered hardware market. Per Skyquest, the AI-enabled hardware market is well-positioned to surpass $84.9 billion by 2031, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.5% from 2024 to 2031.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SMCI currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Huge Upside Potential for SMCI</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Super Micro Computer recorded its all-time high price at $1,229.0 on March 8. After that, the stock price tumbled more than 50%. Despite the meltdown, the stock price has soared nearly 98.5% year to date. The average price target of brokerage firms for the stock represents an increase of 50.4% from the last closing price of $562.51. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $325-$1,500.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">SMCI&rsquo;s Product Innovation</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">SMCI&rsquo;s solutions include a range of rack mount and blade server systems, as well as components. SMCI&rsquo;s Server Building Block Solutions provides benefits across many environments, including data center deployment, high-performance computing, high-end workstations, storage networks and standalone server installations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the future, Super Micro Computer is expected to generate strong sales supported by its plans to bring a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia online later this year. The growing demand for its DLC servers is another positive. SMCI expects its products to reduce the energy costs of data center operators by as much as 40%, while improving computing performance.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Attractive Valuation of SMCI</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Super Micro Computer is currently trading at an attractive valuation compared to its peers. The stock has a forward price/earnings (P/E) of 18.30X, in line with the industry&rsquo;s P/E but below the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s P/E of 19.46X. It has a price/sale (P/S) of 2.30X, compared with the industry&rsquo;s P/S of 2.49X and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s P/S of 2.90X. SMCI has a price/book (P/B) of 6.27X, lower than the industry&rsquo;s P/B of 10.30X but higher than the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s P/B of 3.68X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, Super Micro Computer has generated profits competently since it has a return on equity (ROE) of 30.57%, compared with the industry&rsquo;s ROE of 15.34% and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s ROE of 16.52%. Any ROE of more than 20% is generally considered very strong.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SMCI has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 87.5% and 51.65%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings remained the same in the last seven days.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.0 average gain per year.

<![CDATA[ <h3 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Releases</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; August 28, 2024 &ndash; Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Texas Instruments Inc.&rsquo;s TXN.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Here are highlights from Wednesday&rsquo;s Analyst Blog:</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold NVIDIA Stock Before Q2 Earnings? </em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">After finishing 2023 on a high note, <strong>NVIDIA Corporation</strong> squashed bubble fears, and its shares soared 155.4% year to date, outperforming the Semiconductor - General industry&rsquo;s gain of 113.8%. However, NVIDIA&rsquo;s stock price faced hiccups in early August on fears that its tech customers may curtail artificial intelligence (AI) spending budgets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But NVIDIA&rsquo;s shares did recover ahead of the much-awaited second-quarter fiscal earnings report that can have rippling effects on the broader tech sector. Therefore, investors are rightly contemplating whether to book profits and move on or hold on to NVIDIA&rsquo;s shares for better returns in the future. Let us, thus, look at how to play NVIDIA&rsquo;s shares as of now.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA&rsquo;s High-Profit Margin &ndash; Unsustainable</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA&rsquo;s high profit margin may lead to its vulnerability soon. For first-quarter fiscal 2025, NVIDIA&rsquo;s gross profit margin increased to 78.9% from 66.8% a year ago. However, sustaining such higher profit margins is difficult as demand-supply disparity will lessen in the semiconductor industry where peers are also manufacturing commendable competing products.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a competitive environment, NVIDIA would be compelled to lower the price of its products, and profit margins could take a beating. Huawei is planning to introduce its Ascend 910C chips as early as October, which can compete with NVIDIA&rsquo;s H100 AI chips. Moreover, any possible trade ban on NVIDIA from selling its H20 AI chips to China may hit its profit margins.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why You Shouldn&rsquo;t Sell NVIDIA Stock</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA benefits from tech behemoths&rsquo; spending on AI-related infrastructure. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to trim interest rates in the September policy meeting, mega-tech capital expenditure (CAPEX) spending is expected to rise, a blessing for NVIDIA.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AI, anyhow, is a growing trend and not a temporary phenomenon. NVIDIA&rsquo;s strong positioning in the AI field should help its shares rise. MarketsandMarkets estimated the AI industry to grow from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion by 2030.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA is also well-poised to make the most of the growing gaming market through its primary gaming graphic processing units (GPU) product line, GeForce. According to research firm Newzoo, the global gaming market will generate $187.7 billion in revenues this year. At the same time, NVIDIA is collaborating with Siemens to build an industrial metaverse, a market that is expected to reach $228.6 billion in 2029 from $28.7 billion in 2024, per MarketsandMarkets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, rumors regarding the production delay of NVIDIA&rsquo;s Blackwell AI chips may have caused a lot of concerns. But NVIDIA recently confirmed that Blackwell sampling has begun, and the next-generation chips will be launched later this year. NVIDIA is the worldwide leader in AI chip design and software, giving the company a competitive edge over its rivals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s more, NVIDIA is yet again expected to post encouraging earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which may help its share prices to climb. NVIDIA is projected to report earnings per share of $0.63 for the fiscal second quarter, more than $0.27 a year ago, indicating a jump of 133.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 18.4%, a tell-tale indication that the stock has a reasonable chance to display earnings growth in the forthcoming earnings release on Wednesday, after the bell.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA Stock is Pricey &ndash; Here&rsquo;s How to Trade it</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the positives, buying the NVIDIA stock may burn a hole in your pocket. This is because the unquenchable demand for AI models and dominance in GPUs has made the NVIDIA stock expensive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By looking at the price/earnings ratio, NVIDIA stock currently trades at 46.9X forward earnings. However, NVIDIA&rsquo;s rivals such as <strong>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.</strong>, <strong>Qualcomm Inc.</strong>, <strong>Broadcom Inc.</strong> and <strong>Texas Instruments Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s forward earnings multiples are 44.6X, 16.9X, 33.8X and 40.7X, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Hence, astute investors should wait to buy on the dips. And those who have already bought NVIDIA&rsquo;s shares should hang on to it. After all, NVIDIA stock is for the long run, as AI is here to stay. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<description>
<![CDATA[ <h3 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; August 28, 2024 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses, Knight-Swift Transportation KNX, Werner Enterprises WERN and Covenant Logistics CVLG.</p><p>Industry: Transportation - Truck</p><p>Link: https://www.zacks.com/<wbr>commentary/2327691/3-truck-<wbr>stocks-to-keep-an-eye-on-from-<wbr>a-challenging-industry</wbr></wbr></wbr></p><p><wbr><wbr><wbr><p>The Zacks&nbsp;Transportation-Truck&nbsp;industry is grappling with persistent supply-chain disruptions, a challenging macroeconomic environment characterized by inflation-induced high interest rates and truck driver shortages.</p><p>Despite macroeconomic challenges causing uncertainty in demand, the industry demonstrates resilience, especially for companies prioritizing growth and operational efficiency. Among the companies in the industry that are likely to survive the challenges are&nbsp;<strong>Knight-Swift Transportation</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Werner Enterprises&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Covenant Logistics</strong>.</p><h3>Industry Description</h3><p>The Zacks Transportation - Truck industry houses truck operators transporting freight to diverse customers across North America. These companies provide full-truckload or less-than-truckload (LTL) services over the short, medium or long haul. The range of trucking services these companies provide includes dry-van, dedicated, refrigerated, flatbed and expedited. Some companies have an extensive fleet of company-owned tractors and trucks and independent contractor trucks.</p><p>Alongside trucking, most entities offer logistics and intermodal services as well as value-added services like container drayage, truckload brokerage, supply-chain consulting and warehousing. A few also offer asset-light services to other third-party logistics companies in the transportation sector.</p><h3>3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Trucking Industry</h3><p><strong><em>Supply-Chain Disruptions &amp; Weak Freight Rates:</em></strong>&nbsp;Although economic activities picked up from the pandemic gloom, supply-chain disruptions continue to dent stocks in the industry. Below-par freight rates are also hurting the industry&rsquo;s prospects. Highlighting the weak freight demand, the Cass Freight Shipments Index declined&nbsp;1.1%&nbsp;year over year in July. This measure has deteriorated year over year in each of the last six months, which confirms the overall declining trend.</p><p><strong><em>Strong Financial Returns for Shareholders: </em></strong>With economic activities gaining pace from the pandemic lows, more companies are allocating their increasing cash pile via dividends and buybacks to pacify long-suffering shareholders. This underlines their financial strength and confidence in the business. Among the players in the Trucking industry, KNX announced an increase in the quarterly dividend this year.</p><p><strong><em>Prolonged Truck-Driver Shortage:</em></strong> The persistent driver crisis in the trucking industry is worsening supply-chain challenges across the United States. Driver scarcity issues limit trucking capacity, making it difficult for trucking companies to meet increased freight demand. American Trucking Associations&rsquo; chief economist, Bob Costello, expects the trucking industry to be short of more than&nbsp;160,000 drivers by 2030.</p><h3>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects</h3><p>The Zacks Transportation - Truck industry is a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation&nbsp;sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #235, which places it in the bottom 6% of 250 plus Zacks industries.</p><p>The group&rsquo;s&nbsp;Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p>The industry&rsquo;s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential. The industry&#39;s earnings estimate for 2024 has decreased 31.4% on a year-over-year basis.</p><p>Before we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to hold on to, let&rsquo;s take a look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock market performance and the valuation picture.</p><h3>Truck Industry Underperforms the S&amp;P 500 &amp; Sector</h3><p>The Zacks Transportation-Truck industry has lagged the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as the Transportation sector over the past year.</p><p>The industry has risen 2.2% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500&#39;s appreciation of 27% and the broader sector&rsquo;s uptick of 2.3%.</p><h3>Industry&#39;s Current Valuation</h3><p>Based on the trailing 12-month EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), a commonly used multiple for valuing trucking stocks, the industry is currently trading at 14.31X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 18.94X. It is also above the sector&rsquo;s EV/EBITDA of 11.03X.</p><p>Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.8X and as low as 7.56X, with the median being 12.07X.</p><h3>3 Transport Truck Stocks to Consider</h3><p><strong>Knight-Swift</strong>: This truckload carrier is based in Phoenix, AZ. Knight-Swift&rsquo;s efforts to reward its investors through dividends and buybacks bode well. In February 2024, the company&#39;s board of directors approved a dividend hike of 14.2% to 16 cents per share.</p><p>Knight-Swift&rsquo;s cash position is worrisome. KNX currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.&nbsp;</p><p>Headquartered in Omaha, NE, <strong>Werner Enterprises</strong>&rsquo; efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases are commendable. The company&rsquo;s liquidity position is good.</p><p>WERN&rsquo;s cost-control efforts are praiseworthy. WERN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has remained stable over the past seven days.</p><p><strong>Covenant Logistics </strong>offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services, including asset-based expedited, dedicated and irregular route truckload capacity, along with asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage capability.</p><p>CVLG&rsquo;s cost-control efforts are appreciated. CVLG currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. The average beat is 3.99%.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+44.9%, +48.4%</strong> and <strong>+55.2%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Media Contact</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">support@zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

<![CDATA[ <h3 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; August 28, 2024 &ndash; Stocks in this week&rsquo;s article are American Guild Holdings Co. GHLD, DoubleDown Interactive Co., Ltd. DDI and Travelzoo TZOO.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Buy 3 Top Stocks on the Verge of a Breakout: GHLD, DDI, TZOO</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">After an early August swoon, major bourses on Wall Street rebounded following encouraging retail sales and initial claims reports that quelled recession fears. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell&rsquo;s latest comments that the time has arrived for interest rate cuts also drove stocks higher. The current Middle East tension may, to some extent, dampen the upward trajectory.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s prudent for astute investors to place bets on breakout stocks that can make the most of the stock market&rsquo;s largely broader uptrend. To pick breakout stocks, investors should zero in on stocks whose prices vary within a narrow band.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the stock price falls below this channel, it could be the best time to sell it off. However, the best time to buy a stock per this strategy is when it is about to break above this trading band. Such stocks offer the prospect of impressive gains.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To that end, <strong>American Guild Holdings Co.</strong> , <strong>DoubleDown Interactive Co., Ltd. </strong>and <strong>Travelzoo</strong> have been selected as the breakout stocks for today.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zeroing-In on Breakout Stocks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">To select the right breakout stock, one has to first calculate its support and resistance level. A support level is the lower bound for stock movements, while a resistance level refers to the maximum price it trades within a considerable period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In other words, the demand for a stock is at its lowest at its support level, which means that most traders are willing to sell it. At the resistance level, most traders are willing to go long on the stock, meaning they would like to add it to their portfolio.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Has a Genuine Breakout Happened?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed. When a stock moves above the resistance level, it should be a highly prized commodity for traders. However, whether such a breakout is genuine is another matter altogether.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For a bona fide breakout, the stock&rsquo;s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level. This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long-term price trends. The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study. Despite the risk of misidentification, correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns, even at a price that may not seem attractive at first glance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These criteria narrow the universe of more than 6,853 stocks to only 23. Here are the top three stocks:</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">American Guild</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">American Guild provides financial services. It originates, sells and services residential mortgage loans principally in the United States. GHLD has an expected earnings growth rate of 96.2% for the current year.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">DoubleDown Interactive</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">DoubleDown Interactive is a developer and publisher of digital social casino games. DDI has an expected earnings growth rate of 15.8% for the current year.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Travelzoo</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Travelzoo is an Internet media company. TZOO has an expected earnings growth rate of 18.8% for the current year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

<![CDATA[ <h3 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; August 28, 2024 &ndash; Stocks in this week&rsquo;s article are H&amp;R Block, Inc. HRB, Nova Ltd. NVMI and Jackson Financial Inc. JXN.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>Buy 3 Momentum Anomaly Stocks as Markets Rise on Rate-Cut Hint</em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The broader U.S. equity markets have witnessed a steady uptrend over the past couple of trading sessions, buoyed by strong signals from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about interest rate cuts happening soon. Despite any definite time frame or the quantum of the proposed rate cuts, markets were quick to respond positively and are currently trading in the vicinity of all-time highs. This followed one of the worst performances at the beginning of the month due to a global market sell-off with the unwinding of the yen &ldquo;carry trade&rdquo; as the yen rose in value versus the U.S. dollar.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With a better-than-expected 2.8% annualized GDP growth in the second quarter and solid labor market conditions, it appeared that the economy was back on the growth track, cooling recessionary fears. Amid the uncertainty, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks like <strong>H&amp;R Block, Inc.</strong>, <strong>Nova Ltd.</strong> and <strong>Jackson Financial Inc.</strong> when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, &ldquo;the trend is your friend.&rdquo; At its core, momentum investing is &ldquo;buying high and selling higher.&rdquo; It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. Momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child&rsquo;s play. Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are three stocks out of the four that made it through this screen:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Headquartered in Kansas City, MO, <strong>H&amp;R Block</strong> is a leading provider of tax preparation services. The company provides assisted income tax return preparation, do-it-yourself tax solutions and other products and services associated with income tax return preparation in the United States, Canada and Australia. The stock has surged 60.1% in the past year but declined 2.3% in the past week. H&amp;R Block has a Momentum Score of B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Headquartered in Rehovot, Israel, <strong>Nova</strong> designs, develops, produces and sells process control systems used in the manufacture of semiconductors in Israel, Taiwan, the United States, China, Korea and internationally. Its product portfolio includes a set of metrology platforms for dimensional, films and materials and chemical metrology measurements for process control for various semiconductor manufacturing process steps, including lithography, chemical mechanical planarization, deposition, electrochemical plating and advanced packaging. The stock has gained 81.1% in the past year but declined 6.6% in the past week. Nova has a Momentum Score of A.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Headquartered in Lansing, MI, <strong>Jackson</strong> offers a wide range of annuities to retail investors in the United States. The company operates through three segments: Retail Annuities, Institutional Products, and Closed Life and Annuity Blocks. The stock has rallied 147.4% in the past year but lost 3.4% in the past week. Jackson has a Momentum Score of B.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your trading.

<![CDATA[ <h3 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; August 28, 2024 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses, Healthpeak Properties, Inc. DOC, Lamar Advertising Co. LAMR and Cousins Properties Inc. CUZ.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Industry: Equity REITs</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2327668/3-equity-reit-stocks-worth-investing-in-as-the-industry-rebounds</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry is likely to benefit from the resilience and strong fundamentals of a number of asset categories. Healthy trends in healthcare real estate, advertising space and selective rebound in the office category poise players like <strong>Healthpeak Properties, Inc.</strong>, <strong>Lamar Advertising Co.</strong> and <strong>Cousins Properties Inc.</strong> well for growth. Moreover, the recent expectations regarding the interest rate cut have renewed enthusiasm in the REITs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, geopolitical unrest and choppiness in the macroeconomic environment remain a concern, and customers are prioritizing cost management and delaying leasing decisions for certain asset categories.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">About the Industry</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other sector comprises a diverse collection of REIT stocks representing various asset categories, including industrial, office, lodging, healthcare, self-storage, data centers, infrastructures and more. Equity REITs lease out space within these properties to tenants, generating income through rental payments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Economic growth assumes a central role within the real estate sector as economic expansion directly correlates with higher demand for real estate, increased occupancy rates and greater bargaining power for landlords to command higher rental rates. Moreover, the performance of Equity REITs hinges on the specific dynamics of their underlying assets and the geographic location of their properties. It is imperative to thoroughly explore the fundamentals of these asset categories before making any investment decisions.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">What&#39;s Shaping the Future of the REIT and Equity Trust - Other Industry?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Resilient Demand Across Various Asset Classes Drives Growth Potential:</em></strong> The demand for several asset categories is expected to stay healthy in the near to mid-term. The projected increase in the senior citizen population, along with a rise in healthcare spending within this age group and restricted supply, suggests a positive outlook for healthcare REITs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further, in today&#39;s digital era, there is a strong demand for data center space as businesses and service providers increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence into their strategies and drive their digital transformation initiatives, boosting growth prospects for data center REITs. For industrial real estate, even though rent growth is slowing, healthy demand is likely to keep this asset type in limelight. Meanwhile, in the office real estate sector, despite the impact of hybrid work arrangements on overall demand, there is a growing tenant preference for premium office spaces with superior amenities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Interest Rate Cut Expectations Boost Attractiveness: </em></strong>The recent indications of a rate cut in the September FOMC meeting are likely to raise the attractiveness of the REITs. Any rate cut, even a slight one, is good news for the rate-sensitive REIT industry because REITs&rsquo; dependence on debt for business keeps investors optimistic about their performances in a rate-cut environment as the companies benefit from lower borrowing costs. Moreover, low interest rates contribute to higher valuations. Also, their dividend yield grabs investors&rsquo; attention more than yields on fixed-income and money market accounts in times like these.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Economic Choppiness to Hamper Near-Term Activity: </em></strong>Despite the positive trends, concerns persist about the impact of slower economic growth on commercial real estate activity. Geopolitical uncertainties add to these challenges. In this environment, customers are focused on cost control and are delaying leasing decisions, showing reduced urgency in making new commitments while waiting for further price discovery.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By asset category, industrial real estate demand is being impacted. For office space, leasing activity is likely to continue to be affected by hybrid work arrangements and uncertainty in the broader business climate. In the self-storage sector, new customer price sensitivity and lower new customer rates are likely to create headwinds for these REITs in the near term. For Tower REITs, demand is expected to soften in the coming quarters due to reduced carrier capital expenditures and the churn effect, which could hurt profitability.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry is housed within the broader Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it in the top 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates robust near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The industry&rsquo;s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the northward revision of funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group&rsquo;s growth potential of late.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before we present a few stocks that you might want to consider for your portfolio, let&rsquo;s take a look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Lags the Stock Market Performance</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The REIT and Equity Trust - Other Industry has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Finance sector in a year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The industry has risen 18.1% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s increase of 27% and the broader Finance sector&rsquo;s 27.9% jump.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Industry&#39;s Current Valuation</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">On the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-FFO ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing REIT - Others, we see that the industry is currently trading at 16.62X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 21.72X. The industry is trading above the Finance sector&rsquo;s forward 12-month P/E of 16.03X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 22.13X and as low as 12.81X, with a median of 17.80X.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">3 REIT and Equity Trust - Other Stocks to Buy</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Healthpeak Properties:</strong> Headquartered in Denver, CO, Healthpeak Properties has a diversified portfolio of high-quality healthcare properties across three core asset classes of outpatient medical, lab and continuing care retirement community real estate. The REIT&rsquo;s top-quality healthcare real estate assets are positioned in the high-barrier-to-entry markets of the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Solid demand for lab assets amid the increasing need for drug innovation and developments is likely to drive its lab portfolio&rsquo;s growth. DOC is also poised to benefit from the rising senior citizens population and their high healthcare spending trends.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Its merger with Physicians Realty also has increased opportunities for internal and external growth. Encouraging capital-recycling moves and a healthy balance sheet bode well for long-term growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DOC currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s 2024 revenues calls for a 23.7% increase year over year. The consensus mark for 2024 FFO per share has also been raised over the past three months to $1.79. The stock has risen 18.9% in the past three months. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lamar Advertising Company:</strong> This REIT is one of the largest owners and operators of outdoor advertising structures in the United States. The impressive footprint of outdoor advertising assets, the unmatched logo sign business, a diversified tenant base across various sectors and a focus on local businesses are tailwinds for Lamar.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Efforts to expand the digital platform and technological advancements in the low-cost, out-of-home advertising platform bode well for long-term growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lamar currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LAMR&rsquo;s 2024 FFO per share has been raised six cents over the past month to $8.09.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 FFO per share has also moved up three cents over the same period. The stock has appreciated 12.7% in the past six months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cousins Properties:</strong> This Atlanta, GA-based office REIT has an unmatched portfolio of Class A office assets concentrated in the high-growth Sun Belt markets. This region is experiencing a population influx. Amid favorable migration trends and a pro-business environment, corporate relocations and expansions in the Sun Belt markets have gained pace, and this is driving the demand for office space.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is seeing a recovery in demand for its high-quality, well-placed office properties, as highlighted by a rebound in new leasing volume. CUZ&rsquo;s impressive tenant roster, opportunistic investments and developments in the best sub-markets and strong balance sheet will aid the growth momentum.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CUZ currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s 2024 FFO per share has been revised north over the past three months and is currently pegged at $2.66. The stock has also risen 23.5% in the past three months.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Note: <em>Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) &mdash; a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of <strong>+44.9%, +48.4%</strong> and <strong>+55.2%</strong> per year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Media Contact</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Investment Research</p><p style="text-align: justify;">800-767-3771 ext. 9339</p><p style="text-align: justify;">support@zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">https://www.zacks.com</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

<![CDATA[ <h3 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash; August 28, 2024 &ndash; Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses, Eaton Corp. plc ETN, Zurn Elkay Water Solutions Corp. ZWS, EnerSys ENS and Powell Industries, Inc. POWL.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Industry: Manufacturing Electronics</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2327695/4-stocks-to-buy-from-the-promising-manufacturing-electronics-industry</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry is poised for growth on the back of steady demand across the electronic services end market, increasing adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies and product innovation efforts. A surge in e-commerce activities is also likely to aid the industry&rsquo;s growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A slowdown in manufacturing activities and the contraction of new orders might continue to dent the performances of the industry players. <strong>Eaton Corp. plc</strong>, <strong>Zurn Elkay Water Solutions Corp.</strong>, <strong>EnerSys </strong>and <strong>Powell Industries, Inc.</strong> are a few industry participants that are expected to capitalize on prevalent opportunities.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Industry Description</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Manufacturing-Electronics industry comprises companies that manufacture electronic products like battery chargers, battery accessories, outdoor cabinet enclosures, power transmission products, electrical motion controls and motive power devices. Some industry players also provide water-treatment products, engineered flow components, process equipment and turn-key systems. These companies offer state-of-the-art customer support and after-market services to end users.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The firms are increasing investments in developing innovative technologies, boosting customer and employee experience, and supply-chain modernization programs. The manufacturing electronic companies sell products and services in various end markets, including robotics, semiconductor, defense, aerospace, medical equipment and satellite communications.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">3 Manufacturing Electronics Industry Trends in Focus</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector</em></strong>: Persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector has been denting the demand in the industry. Per the Institute for Supply Management&rsquo;s (&ldquo;ISM&rdquo;) report, the Manufacturing Purchasing Manager&rsquo;s Index touched 46.8% in July, down from 48.5% in June. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. After breaking a contraction streak of 16 months by growing in March, the manufacturing sector contracted for the fourth consecutive month in July. Also, the New Orders Index remained in the contraction territory for the fourth consecutive month, registering 47.4% in July.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Strength in the Electronics Services Market</em></strong>: Despite a slowdown in manufacturing activities, demand across key end markets has been stable. Electronics manufacturers are steadily benefiting from the higher adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies and processes by original equipment manufacturers. The requirement for integrating advanced electronic components into machinery and electronic devices has been supporting the electronics manufacturing services market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, a few industry players with wide exposure to the booming medical and life science markets are witnessing a positive momentum across their businesses due to sturdy demand for their products and solutions. A surge in the e-commerce business has also been boosting several industry participants&rsquo; prospects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Technological Advancement Benefits</em></strong>: With the gradual development of business models and cutting-edge technologies, a number of industry players have been banking on digitizing their business operations for a while now. With digitization, businesses are gaining a detailed insight into their operational performances, demand cycles, delivery status and supply-chain issues. This, in turn, is helping them bolster their competitiveness in the market with enhanced operational productivity, product quality and lower costs.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Manufacturing &ndash; Electronics industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #15. This rank places it in the top 6% of more than 250 Zacks industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the strong near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few noteworthy stocks for your consideration. But it is worth looking at the industry&rsquo;s shareholder returns and its current valuation first.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Outperforms Sector &amp; Lags the S&amp;P 500</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Manufacturing &ndash; Electronics industry has outperformed the broader sector but lagged the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index in the year-to-date period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over this period, the industry has gained 8.2% compared with the sector&rsquo;s and S&amp;P 500 Index&rsquo;s growth of 7.9% and 18.1%, respectively.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Industry&#39;s Current Valuation</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">On the basis of forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing manufacturing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 22.99X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 21.72X. It is also above the sector&rsquo;s P/E ratio of 19.16X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 28.43X, as low as 14.73X and at the median of 22.26X.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">4 Manufacturing - Electronics Stocks to Buy</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Powell Industries</strong>: Headquartered in Houston, TX, the company is engaged in designing, manufacturing and distributing custom-engineered equipment and systems. The company has been witnessing several favorable trends across its oil, gas and petrochemical end markets that include growth in energy transition projects, such as biofuels, carbon capture and hydrogen. Also, significant project awards, supported by high investments in LNG, related gas processing and petrochemical processes, are likely to drive its performance in the quarters ahead. POWL currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Powell Industries have soared 118.1% in the year-to-date period. The company reported better-than-expected results in the trailing four quarters, the average being 69.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s fiscal 2024 (ending September 2024) earnings has been revised upward by 32.9% in the past 60 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Eaton</strong>: Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, this is a diversified power management company and a global technology leader in electrical components and systems. Eaton is benefiting from improving end market conditions, increasing demand from the new AI data center, solid backlog level, and product development initiatives through investments in research and development.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company&rsquo;s shares have rallied 23.3% in a year-to-date-period. The company reported better-than-expected results in each of the last four quarters, the average being 4.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 1.5% in the past 60 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Zurn Elkay Water Solutions</strong>: Based in Milwaukee, WI, the company is a designer, manufacturer and marketer of water management solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. ZWS is poised to gain from the growing awareness of the need for clean, filtered drinking water, solid demand for its products and solutions, and its focus on operational execution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date, shares of Zurn Elkay Water Solutions have gained 9.1%. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 8.8%, on average, beating estimates in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #2 company&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 2.5% in the past 60 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EnerSys</strong>: Headquartered in Pennsylvania, the company is a leading provider of stored energy solutions for industrial applications throughout the world. ENS is set to benefit from solid product offerings, a firm focus on product innovation and strength in the electric industrial forklift trucks market. Global megatrends, including 5G expansion, electrification, automation and decarbonization, are aiding the company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although shares of Zacks Rank #2 company have declined 2% year to date, it has rebounded 9.5% in the past six months. EnerSys delivered an earnings surprise of 1.5%, on average, beating estimates in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ENS&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 (ending March 2025) earnings has been revised upward by 2.6% in the past 60 days.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.0 average gain per year.

The sharp selloff comes as the multinational e-commerce firm reiterated that a decline in its profitability is inevitable and expects the trend to start during Q3.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Stiffer competition and broader economic concerns in China are anticipated despite PDD&rsquo;s discounted merchandise allowing the company to take market share from other e-commerce titans such as Alibaba BABA</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp;and JD.com JD</span></span><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c9/75634.jpg?v=69330896" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">PDD&rsquo;s Q2 Results</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">PDD posted Q2 sales of $13.35 billion which missed estimates by 2% although this was an 85% spike from $7.2 billion in the comparative quarter. On the bottom line, Q2 EPS of $3.20 came in 10% better than expected and soared 122% from $1.44 per share a year ago.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Notably, PDD has exceeded the Zacks EPS Consensus for 14 consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 41.14% in its last four quarterly reports.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/29/75635.jpg?v=2113685489" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">PDD&rsquo;s Growth Trajectory</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Based on Zacks estimates, PDD&#39;s total sales are currently forecasted to climb 62% in fiscal 2024 to $56.27 billion versus $34.64 billion last year. PDD&rsquo;s top line is projected to expand another 27% in FY25 to $71.59 billion.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Annual earnings are expected to soar 87% this year to $12.32 per share compared to EPS of $6.56 in 2023. Plus, FY25 EPS is projected to increase another 21%. However, its noteworthy that earnings estimate revisions for FY24 and FY25 could start to decline following the reiteration of PDD&rsquo;s lower profitability warning.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/28/75636.jpg?v=1887915668" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Valuation Comparison</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Trading at $95, PDD&rsquo;s stock is at an 8.1X forward earnings multiple which is a significant discount to the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 23.7X. Furthermore, after the recent pullback, PDD now trades near Alibaba&rsquo;s 9.4X but above JD.com&rsquo;s 6.5X.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/73/75637.jpg?v=645253308" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Bottom Line</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Following its Q2 report PDD Holdings stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While it may be tempting to buy the post-earnings drop in PDD&rsquo;s stock the company is starting to share the same fate as many other Chinese e-commerce firms that appear to be undervalued but have been submerged in volatility due to broader economic fears.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">PDD is certainly a viable long-term investment considering its expansive growth trajectory but there could still be better buying opportunities ahead.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327964/will-pdd-holdings-pdd-stock-rebound-after-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-stocks_in_the_news-2327964">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The construction sector may be of interest to investors with the Fed likely to implement a rate cut of 25 basis points in September.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Of course, lower interest/mortgage rates benefit homebuilders among other building product companies as demand is likely to rise for their services.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Keeping this in mind, here are three highly-ranked building products stocks that were added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list this week.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>LSI Industries </strong>LYTS</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We&rsquo;ll start with LSI Industries, with it noteworthy that its Zacks Building Products-Lighting Industry is in the top 1% of over 250 Zacks industries. LSI Industries is benefiting from its strong business environment as an image solutions company that supplies high-quality lighting fixtures for applications in the retail, specialty niche, and commercial markets.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">With its stock trading at $15, LSI Industries&#39; valuation supports its affordable price tag.

More intriguing is that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">LSI Industries&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">stock trades below the optimum level of less than 1X sales with its top line slated to increase 14% in FY25 and projected to rise another 7% in FY26 to $577.31 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In addition to its strong buy rating,&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">LSI Industries&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">has an overall &ldquo;A&rdquo; VGM Zacks Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.</span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a6/75617.jpg?v=975642214" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">MI Homes </strong>MHO</p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Among homebuilders, MI Homes stands out as one the leading builders of single-family homes in the United States. Notably, the Zacks Building Products-Home Builders Industry is in the top 6% of all Zacks industries.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">MI Homes&rsquo; earnings potential is very lucrative with its robust bottom line expected to expand 21% this year to $19.58 per share versus EPS of $16.21 in 2023. Even better, MI Homes trades at just 8.4X forward earnings with FY25 EPS projected to rise another 7%.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Investors may also be drawn to MI Homes&rsquo; balance sheet as its cash and equivalents have skyrocketed from $6 million in 2019 to $837 million at the end of Q2 2024. Furthermore, MI Homes has $4.34 billion in total assets which is nicely above its $1.59 billion in total liabilities.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/97/75621.jpg?v=1350156065" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Century Communities </strong>CCS</p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Also belonging to the top-rated Zacks Building Products-Homebuilders Industry is Century Communities.

Trading at 9.5X forward earnings, Century Communities FY25 EPS is expected to increase another 15% to $12.24 per share.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/66/75622.jpg?v=899660180" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><strong style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Bottom Line</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In correlation with their strong business industries, earnings estimate revisions have gone up for these highly-ranked building products stocks.

<![CDATA[ Is Dodge & Cox Stock Fund (DODGX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 22:21:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Having trouble finding a Large Cap Value fund? Dodge &amp; Cox Stock Fund (DODGX) is a potential starting point. DODGX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Objective</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Large Cap Value mutual funds invest in stocks with a market capitalization of $10 billion or more, but whose share prices do not reflect their intrinsic value; this value investing strategy often leads to low P/E ratios and high dividend yields, though growth levels are often curtailed. The high-growth opportunity of these funds are slowed even further, as large-cap securities are generally in stable industries with low to moderate growth prospects. Therefore, Large Cap Value funds are usually more appealing to investors who are interested in a stable income stream.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>History of Fund/Manager</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dodge &amp; Cox is responsible for DODGX, and the company is based out of San Francisco, CA. Dodge &amp; Cox Stock Fund debuted in December of 1964. Since then, DODGX has accumulated assets of about $63.66 billion, according to the most recently available information. The fund is currently managed by a team of investment professionals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Investors naturally seek funds with strong performance. DODGX has a 5-year annualized total return of 13.48% and is in the top third among its category peers. If you&#39;re interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund&#39;s 3 -year annualized total return of 9.08%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.</p><p>It is important to note that the product&#39;s returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund&#39;s [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.</p><p>When looking at a fund&#39;s performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of DODGX over the past three years is 17.25% compared to the category average of 0%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 20.86% compared to the category average of 24%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Risk Factors</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Investors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.03, which means it is hypothetically as volatile as the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio&#39;s performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&amp;P 500. With a negative alpha of -1.17, managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Expenses</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, DODGX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.51% compared to the category average of 98%. So, DODGX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.</p><p>Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $2,500 and that each subsequent investment needs to be at $100</p><p>Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Dodge &amp; Cox Stock Fund ( DODGX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively strong performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, Dodge &amp; Cox Stock Fund ( DODGX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.</p><p>This could just be the start of your research on DODGXin the Large Cap Value category.

</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 22:00:05 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>United Airlines (UAL) closed the most recent trading day at $42.14, moving -1.5% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.16%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.02%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.16%.</p><p>Prior to today's trading, shares of the airline had lost 8.51% over the past month. This has lagged the Transportation sector's gain of 0.38% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.97% in that time.</p><p>Investors will be eagerly watching for the performance of United Airlines in its upcoming earnings disclosure. In that report, analysts expect United Airlines to post earnings of $3.02 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 17.26%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $14.97 billion, indicating a 3.39% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.</p><p>Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.63 per share and revenue of $56.82 billion. These totals would mark changes of -4.18% and +5.77%, respectively, from last year.</p><p>Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for United Airlines. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.</p><p>Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.</p><p>Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.14% higher. Right now, United Airlines possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).</p><p>In terms of valuation, United Airlines is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 4.44. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 10.13 of its industry.</p><p>We can also see that UAL currently has a PEG ratio of 0.69. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Transportation - Airline industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.89 as trading concluded yesterday.</p><p>The Transportation - Airline industry is part of the Transportation sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 226, this industry ranks in the bottom 11% of all industries, numbering over 250.</p><p>The strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.</p><p>Be sure to use Zacks.com to monitor all these stock-influencing metrics, and more, throughout the forthcoming trading sessions.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327954/united-airlines-ual-stock-declines-while-market-improves-some-information-for-investors?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_6v2-2327954">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Boring Regular Trading, Big After-Market on Q2 Beats: JWN, AMBA, BOX ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Tuesday, August 27th, 2024</strong><br /><br />Three out of the four major stock market indexes closed Tuesday&rsquo;s session flat as a pancake. Such is trading life in the last week of August, typically. The Dow set a new record closing high, a mere 18 points above where it closed yesterday, +0.05%. Both the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 finished the day up +0.17%. Only the small-cap Russell 2000 came in -0.66% lower on the session.<br /><br />What&rsquo;s notably more exciting are the earnings reports after the bell. We&rsquo;re still a day away from what might be a record-breaking quarter from <strong>NVIDIA</strong> NVDA tomorrow after the close, but that&rsquo;s not stopping those July-quarter Q2 closers in Retail and Tech from putting up big numbers in late trading.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>Nordstrom Shares Up on Q2 Earnings Beat</h2><br /><p>Luxury department store <strong>Nordstrom</strong> JWN surprised to the upside after Tuesday&rsquo;s close, with Q2 earnings of 96 cents per share shooting past the 74 cents in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues of $3.89 billion were ahead of the $3.85 billion anticipated, with same-store sales coming in +1.9% year over year, led by +4% growth from Nordstrom Rack.<br /><br />Nordstrom shares were trading as high as +12% on the news, but have settled back to +9% &mdash; still a solid performance. This adds to the +15% stock gains year to date. It&rsquo;s also a nice bounce-back from the previous quarter, which posted a negative earnings surprise of -200%.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>PVH Beats on Bottom Line, Shares Lower</h2><br /><p><strong>PVH Corp.</strong> PVH &mdash; formerly known as Phillips-Van Heusen, the &ldquo;preppy&rdquo; apparel company big in the &rsquo;80s with its &ldquo;alligator&rdquo; Izod polo shirts, also posted a big beat on its Q2 earnings per share today. The company reported $3.01 per share, ahead of the $2.27 per share analysts had been looking for. Revenues in quarter matched the $2.07 billion estimate.<br /><br />Earnings guidance was raised, though not fully to cover today&rsquo;s 74-cent earnings beat. This, plus a -4% slide in Tommy Hilfiger for the quarter and -1% for Calvin Klein, has led PVH stock to drop -4% in the late session. Shares were already down -14% year to date.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>Box Beats and Raises for Q2 and Full-Year</h2><br /><p><strong>Box </strong>BOX outperformed on both top and bottom lines in its Q2 report this afternoon: earnings of 44 cents per share on $270 million in quarterly sales outpaced the estimates of 40 cents per share and $269.2 million, respectively. This marks the third-straight earnings beat for the cloud-based content management firm.<br /><br />Guidance was also strong. Next-quarter revenues are now expected to bring in between $274-276 million, beating the Zacks consensus $271 million. Full-year earnings are now anticipated to be between $1.64-1.66 per share, nicely ahead of the $1.57 projected. Shares for BOX are +5% in late trading.<br />&nbsp;</p><h2>Ambarella Shares Up +18% on Big Q2 Beats</h2><br /><p>Silicon Valley-based semiconductor developer for image processing, <strong>Ambarella </strong>AMBA, posted a slimmer-than-expected bottom-line loss of -13 cents per share, compare with the -19 cents analysts had been expecting. Revenues of $63.7 million in the quarter ahead were nicely ahead of the $62.2 million forecast.<br /><br />But a big revenue guidance upgrade for next quarter is the big news here: Ambarella now expects between $77-81 million for Q3, way past the $69.8 million in the Zacks consensus. Record revenue in its Edge AI offering is driving the stock up +18% in the after-market.<br /><br />Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 21:50:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Lockheed Martin (LMT) closed at $560.41 in the latest trading session, marking a +0.41% move from the prior day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.16%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.02%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.16%.</p><p>The aerospace and defense company's stock has climbed by 5.77% in the past month, exceeding the Aerospace sector's gain of 2.37% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.97%.</p><p>Analysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Lockheed Martin in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $6.40, indicating a 5.47% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $17.45 billion, indicating a 3.37% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.</p><p>For the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $26.49 per share and a revenue of $71.14 billion, representing changes of -4.78% and +5.28%, respectively, from the prior year.</p><p>Furthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Lockheed Martin. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.</p><p>Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.</p><p>The Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.31% lower within the past month. Lockheed Martin is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.</p><p>Digging into valuation, Lockheed Martin currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 21.07. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 20.4, which means Lockheed Martin is trading at a premium to the group.</p><p>It's also important to note that LMT currently trades at a PEG ratio of 4.51. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. The Aerospace - Defense industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.87 as trading concluded yesterday.</p><p>The Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 52, finds itself in the top 21% echelons of all 250+ industries.</p><p>The strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.</p><p>Keep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327950/lockheed-martin-lmt-surpasses-market-returns-some-facts-worth-knowing?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_6v1-2327950">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.</p><p>Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.</p><p>The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

<![CDATA[ Time to Buy Financial & Bank ETFs? ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Financial exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have rebounded this year after a prolonged period of volatility. A flattening yield curve was a major concern over the past few years. However, decent global growth, cooling U.S. inflation and hopes of a Fed rate cut have now made the space a winner.</p><p>Shares of <strong>Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund</strong> XLF are up 17.7% this year versus an 18.9% gain for the S&amp;P 500. We expect the space to have more room to run. Let&rsquo;s find out what&rsquo;s working in favor of financial ETFs now.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Gradually Steepening Yield Curve</strong></span></h2><p>Since banks borrow money at short-term rates and lend capital at long-term rates, the steepening of the yield curve is always a plus for bank ETFs. On Friday, the spread between the 10-year and two-year treasury yield stood at negative 0.09 percentage points versus negative 0.17 percentage points recorded at the start of the month, benefiting bank stocks and ETFs.</p><p>Notably, the movement of short-term bonds is more dependent on Fed behavior than long-term bonds. With the Fed likely to enact its first rate cut in four years in September, short-term rates are likely to fall ahead. This would boost risk-on trade sentiments and increase long-term rates, which is why a steepening yield curve is likely.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Focus on Value in Financial Sector</strong></span></h2><p>Financial stocks are undervalued at the current level. The financial sector&rsquo;s Major Regional Bank segment currently has a forward P/E of 12.14X. This is lower than the P/E of 19.46X boasted by the <strong>S&amp;P 500 ETF iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF </strong>IVV. The dividend yield of the Major Regional Bank segment is 3.32% versus 1.55% possessed by the S&amp;P 500.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Favorable Earnings Picture for Banking Giants</strong></span></h2><p>Leading banks such as <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> GS and <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> JPM reported robust increases in investment-banking revenues in the second quarter of 2024.</p><p>The revival was backed by improved economic conditions that prompted corporate clients to engage in deal advisory and debt offerings. Executives are cautiously optimistic, viewing these developments as early signs of recovery in capital markets and mergers and acquisitions, according to the Wall Street Journal (read: What You Need to Know About Bank ETFs In Light of Q2 Earnings).</p><p>The earnings report also indicated challenges in consumer banking segments. Higher inflation and interest rates exerted pressure on lower-income consumers. If rate cuts continue to be implemented, this segment should fare better.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Financials ETFs in Focus </strong></span></h2><p>Against this backdrop, we highlight a few financial ETFs that are poised for further rally.</p><p><strong>US Financials iShares ETF</strong> IYF &ndash; Shares up 19.6% this year.</p><p><strong>Financial Alphadex ETF First Trust</strong> FXO &ndash; Shares up&nbsp;16.6% this year.</p><p><strong>U.S. Regional Banks iShares ETF</strong> IAT &ndash; Shares up&nbsp;13.2% this year.</p><p><strong>S&amp;P 500 Financials Sector SPDR</strong> XLF &ndash; Shares up 17.7% this year.</p><p><strong>Invesco KBW Bank ETF </strong>KBWB &ndash; Shares up 17.7% this year.</p><h2><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Is There Any Wall of Worry?</strong></span></h2><p>Although things are improving for the U.S. financial sector, investors should not forget the U.S. regional banking crisis in March 2023. Some pressure may still be felt in the regional banking space. <strong>SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF</strong> KRE has gone up 9.8% this year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327922/time-to-buy-financial-bank-etfs?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2327922">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">After finishing 2023 on a high note, <strong>NVIDIA Corporation</strong> NVDA squashed bubble fears, and its shares soared 155.4% year to date, outperforming the Semiconductor - General industry&rsquo;s gain of 113.8%. However, NVIDIA&rsquo;s stock price faced hiccups in early August on fears that its tech customers may curtail artificial intelligence (AI) spending budgets.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b8/75510.jpg?v=804625626" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>But NVIDIA&rsquo;s shares did recover ahead of the much-awaited second-quarter fiscal earnings report that can have rippling effects on the broader tech sector. Therefore, investors are rightly contemplating whether to book profits and move on or hold on to NVIDIA&rsquo;s shares for better returns in the future. Let us, thus, look at how to play NVIDIA&rsquo;s shares as of now.&nbsp;</p><h2>NVIDIA&rsquo;s High-Profit Margin &ndash; Unsustainable</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA&rsquo;s high-profit margin may lead to its vulnerability soon. For first-quarter fiscal 2025, NVIDIA&rsquo;s gross profit margin increased to 78.9% from 66.8% a year ago. However, sustaining such higher profit margins is difficult as demand-supply disparity will lessen in the semiconductor industry where peers are also manufacturing commendable competing products.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a competitive environment, NVIDIA would be compelled to lower the price of its products, and profit margins could take a beating. Huawei is planning to introduce its Ascend 910C chips as early as October, which can compete with NVIDIA&rsquo;s H100 AI chips. Moreover, any possible trade ban on NVIDIA from selling its H20 AI chips to China may hit its profit margins.</p><h2>Why You Shouldn&rsquo;t Sell NVIDIA Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA benefits from tech behemoths&rsquo; spending on AI-related infrastructure. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to trim interest rates in the September policy meeting, mega-tech capital expenditure (CAPEX) spending is expected to rise, a blessing for NVIDIA.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AI, anyhow, is a growing trend and not a temporary phenomenon. NVIDIA&rsquo;s strong positioning in the AI field should help its shares rise. MarketsandMarkets estimated the AI industry to grow from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion by 2030.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA is also well-poised to make the most of the growing gaming market through its primary gaming graphic processing units (GPU) product line, GeForce. According to research firm Newzoo, the global gaming market will generate $187.7 billion in revenues this year. At the same time, NVIDIA is collaborating with Siemens to build an industrial metaverse, a market that is expected to reach $228.6 billion in 2029 from $28.7 billion in 2024, per MarketsandMarkets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, rumors regarding the production delay of NVIDIA&rsquo;s Blackwell AI chips may have caused a lot of concerns. But NVIDIA recently confirmed that Blackwell sampling has begun, and the next-generation chips will be launched later this year. NVIDIA is the worldwide leader in AI chip design and software, giving the company a competitive edge over its rivals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s more, NVIDIA is yet again expected to post encouraging earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, which may help its share prices to climb. NVIDIA is projected to report earnings per share of $0.63 for the fiscal second quarter, more than $0.27 a year ago, indicating a jump of 133.3%.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 18.4%, a tell-tale indication that the stock has a reasonable chance to display earnings growth in the forthcoming earnings release on Wednesday, after the bell.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a6/75511.jpg?v=997552404" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>NVIDIA Stock is Pricey &ndash; Here&rsquo;s How to Trade it</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the positives, buying the NVIDIA stock may burn a hole in your pocket. This is because the unquenchable demand for AI models and dominance in GPUs has made the NVIDIA stock expensive.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By looking at the price/earnings ratio, NVIDIA stock currently trades at 46.9X forward earnings. However, NVIDIA&rsquo;s rivals such as <strong>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.</strong> AMD, <strong>QUALCOMM Incorporated</strong> QCOM, <strong>Broadcom Inc.</strong> AVGO and <strong>Texas Instruments Incorporated</strong>&rsquo;s TXN forward earnings multiples are 44.6X, 16.9X, 33.8X and 40.7X, respectively.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/af/75512.jpg?v=707145868" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Hence, astute investors should wait to buy on the dips. And those who have already bought NVIDIA&rsquo;s shares should hang on to it. After all, NVIDIA stock is for the long run, as AI is here to stay. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327917/should-you-buy-sell-or-hold-nvidia-stock-before-q2-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|investment_ideas-2327917">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The cruise industry is benefiting from strong demand and increased booking volumes. Solid bookings concerning North American and European sailings are driving the space. Also, strong pricing (on closer-in-demand) and solid onboard spending bode well for the industry.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in cruise line operators with a favorable Zacks Rank. A few such operators have strong upside left. Three among them are <strong>Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. </strong>RCL, <strong>Carnival Corp. &amp; plc</strong> CCL and <strong>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.</strong> NCLH.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strong Demand for Cruise Liners</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the number of passengers embarking on cruises is projected to reach 35.7 million in 2024, suggesting an increase from 31.5 million in 2023. The projection calls for a 6% rise from the 2019 figures, reflecting the cruising industry&rsquo;s upside.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Cruise operators are investing in new hardware, including mega-ships and private destinations, to acquire new customers. J.P. Morgan JPM Research estimates the cruise industry to capture approximately 3.8% of the $1.9 trillion global vacation market by 2028.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">3 Top Cruise Line Stock Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">We have narrowed our search to three big cruise liners that have strong potential for the rest of 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks currently carries a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The chart below shows the share price performance of our five picks in the past three months.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7a/75503.jpg?v=258922203" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Solid Earnings Estimate Revisions for RCL Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. posted impressive second-quarter 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. RCL has been benefiting from strong cruising demand from new and loyal guests and robust booking trends. Also, strength in consumer spending onboard and pre-cruise purchases bodes well.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">RCL emphasized investing in a modern digital travel platform to streamline the vacation booking process for customers and expand wallet share. Moreover, RCL emphasized new innovative ships and onboard experiences to boost its offering and deliver superior yields and margins.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank #1 Royal Caribbean Cruises has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 18.1% and 69.9%, respectively, for the current year. The stock has seen positive earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter, current year and next year in the last 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/31/75504.jpg?v=248668614" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Strong Price Upside for RCL Shares</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past three months, RCL shares provided a return of 9.2%. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 14.2% from the last closing price of $162.05. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $154-$210.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">CCL Shares See Solid Earnings Estimate Revisions&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Carnival Corp. &amp; plc&nbsp;reported impressive second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This was driven by sustained demand strength and increased booking volumes at significantly higher prices. CCL reported strong booking momentum for 2025, with record volumes surpassing the 2024 levels in price and occupancy.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CCL&rsquo;s focus on marketing campaigns and fleet-optimization efforts, along with fleet expansion initiatives is encouraging. Given the uptrend, CCL raised its fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS expectations to $1.18 from the previous expectation of $0.98.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank #2 Carnival has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending November 2024).

NCLH is benefiting from strong demand, high pricing and increased booking volumes, leading to record advance ticket sales.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">NCLH&rsquo;s focus on fleet expansion efforts and digital initiatives bodes well. These factors showcase that the company&rsquo;s strategy is well-aligned with its growth goals and 2026 financial and sustainability targets. Given the substantial progress made so far and current demand expectations, NCLH raised its 2024 full-year guidance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank #1 Norwegian Cruise Line has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.8% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year. The stock has seen positive earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter, next quarter, current year and next year in the last 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/28/75506.jpg?v=91462299" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past three months, NCLH stock provided a return of 9.1%.

<![CDATA[ 5 Restaurant Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio as July Sales Rebound ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The U.S. restaurant industry grew at a solid pace over the past two years, amid price pressures and higher wages and food costs. The growth has somewhat slowed this year but the industry has still made a solid effort to hold its ground.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Restaurant sales have climbed over the past few months, benefiting a large number of restaurant brands such as <strong>El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc.</strong> LOCO,<strong>Meritage Hospitality Group Inc. </strong>MHGU, <strong>Potbelly Corporation</strong> PBPB, <strong>Texas Roadhouse, Inc.</strong> TXRH and <strong>Wingstop</strong> WING, which have seen positive earnings estimate revisions along with a favorable Zacks Rank.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Restaurant Sales Grow on Ebbing Price Pressures</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Commerce Department reported earlier this month that sales at U.S. bars and restaurants totaled $97.01 billion in July, up 0.4% from June&rsquo;s total of $96.6 billion. Year over year, restaurant sales grew 3.4% in July.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Inflation has declined sharply and price pressures have eased over the past quarter. Consumers have lately been spending more freely as a result. This has seen sales rebounding over the past few months after a brief slowdown.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the industry still faces several challenges. The restaurant industry grew 3.3% in 2023, while it has grown 1.1% year to date. The broader market index, the S&amp;P 500, has instead jumped 29.3% and 18.8%, respectively, over the same period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Higher menu prices have been one of the major challenges to sales growth. Also, rising costs are hurting profit margins. Increased pre-opening expenses, higher marketing costs and expenditures related to sales-boosting efforts are putting pressure on restaurants&rsquo; margins.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, restaurant owners are trying to overcome the hurdles by emphasizing digital innovation, sales-boosting strategies, and cost-saving measures. They frequently collaborate with delivery services and digital platforms to increase their sales.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The restaurant industry is likely to get a boost once the Fed starts its rate cuts, which will ease borrowing costs. This is likely to ease operating costs and widen profit margins.</p><h2>5 Top Restaurant Stocks Promising Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">We have narrowed our search to five restaurant stocks that have solid growth potential for the rest of 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days.

<![CDATA[ Enterprise Products to Buy Pinon Midstream: Time to Bet on the Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Last Wednesday, <strong>Enterprise Products Partners LP</strong> EPD announced an agreement to acquire Pi&ntilde;on Midstream for $950 million in an all-cash transaction. Pi&ntilde;on, a key player in gas gathering, compression and treating, operates in the Delaware Basin, a sub-basin of the Permian.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The acquisition is expected to be accretive to the partnership&rsquo;s earnings. The key question for investors now is how to strategically position themselves in light of this acquisition. First, let&rsquo;s check some fundamental aspects of the fully integrated midstream energy player.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">EPD to Buy Delaware Midstream Player: Fee-Based Earnings?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Once the acquisition of all the equity interests in Pi&ntilde;on is completed, likely in the fourth quarter of this year, Enterprise Products will secure additional fee-based earnings. This is because Pi&ntilde;on&rsquo;s assets, comprising 50 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines, compressor stations and treating facilities with plans for significant capacity expansion, are backed by long-term fee-based contracts, minimizing exposure to commodity price fluctuations and reducing volume risks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Pi&ntilde;on operates a premier sour gas treatment system in the Delaware Basin, an area with significant untapped potential. With the acquisition, EPD will be able to establish a significant presence in the basin much faster. Read our blog: Enterprise Products Signs Deal to Acquire Pinon Midstream.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">EPD&rsquo;s Diversified Asset Base &amp; Attractive Distribution Yield</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Enterprise Products, a top-tier North American midstream service provider, boasts a vast and diversified asset portfolio. This includes more than 50,000 miles of pipelines and a storage capacity of 300 million barrels. These assets are utilized by shippers on long-term contracts to transport and store natural gas liquids, crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals. The partnership also has 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity, securing stable fee-based revenues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, EPD is set to generate additional fee-based earnings with $6.7 billion worth of major capital projects either currently in service or under construction. These project backlogs will not only secure stable cashflows but will also generate handsome unit-holder returns.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Enterprise Products Partners LP" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/42/75535.jpg?v=311493314" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Enterprise Products Partners LP</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Supported by its stable and resilient business model, Enterprise Products has achieved 26 consecutive years of distribution hikes. The current distribution yield of the partnership stands at 7.2%, higher than 3.7% of the composite stocks belonging to the oil-energy sector.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/4b/75534.jpg?v=586706954" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">How Should Investors Play EPD Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">All these positive developments are reflected in Enterprise Products&rsquo; one-year stock price chart. Over the period, the units of the partnership have gained 19.2%, outperforming the 8.7% growth of the composite stocks belonging to the oil-energy sector. <strong>Kinder Morgan Inc</strong> KMI stock and <strong>Enbridge Inc.</strong> ENB stock, two other leading midstream energy players, have gained 31.3% and 23.9%, respectively, over the same period.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>One-Year Stock Price Chart</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/02/75530.jpg?v=1237705691" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, investors should be aware of certain concerns. The planned expansion of Pi&ntilde;on&#39;s facilities, including the addition of a third acid gas injection well, will require substantial capital investment. EPD must ensure that these investments are effectively managed to realize the anticipated returns. Furthermore, integrating Pi&ntilde;on&#39;s operations into EPD&#39;s existing structure could present logistical and operational challenges.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also, as a midstream company heavily involved in fossil fuels, EPD faces potential risks from shifts in energy policies and the global transition to renewable energy. These long-term risks could affect the demand for EPD&#39;s services and hurt its growth prospects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite these negatives, the partnership&rsquo;s long-term outlook looks promising, backed by stable fee-based cash flows and attractive distribution yields. However, investors are advised to be cautious. Instead of rushing to add the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to their portfolios, it may be prudent to wait for a more opportune entry point. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This is because, at this moment, units are somewhat expensive on a relative basis, with the current 9.84X trailing 12-month enterprise value/earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization staying above the 9.53X five-year median. Also, the partnership is trading at a premium to the broader sector average of 3.19X.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ce/75531.jpg?v=1755499831" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327920/enterprise-products-to-buy-pinon-midstream-time-to-bet-on-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2327920">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ CrowdStrike's Q2 Earnings Growth to be Hit by Sluggish Sales ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.</strong> CRWD is set to announce second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug. 28. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents for the company&rsquo;s second-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) indicates a 32.4% year-over-year increase.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While the bottom-line projection might appear to be a positive indicator, the reality is more nuanced when compared to (more than) 50% growth that CrowdStrike has consistently delivered in the past 13 quarters.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>CrowdStrike Price and EPS Surprise</h3><h2> <img alt="CrowdStrike Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/ca/1724753962.png" style="width: 610px; height: 295px;" title="" /> </h2><p>CrowdStrike price-eps-surprise | CrowdStrike Quote</p></div><h2>CRWD&rsquo;s Slowing Sales Growth: A Critical Issue</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Although CrowdStrike has experienced impressive growth since its IPO, recent quarterly reports have shown a deceleration in its growth rate. The company&#39;s revenue growth, while still robust, is not as explosive as in previous years.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CrowdStrike had enjoyed more than 50% year-over-year top-line growth till fiscal 2023. However, the growth rate decelerated in fiscal 2024 to 36%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2025 suggests that top-line growth will further decelerate to 31%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This slowdown is partly due to the law of large numbers &mdash; as companies grow larger, maintaining high percentage growth rates becomes increasingly difficult. Also, CrowdStrike&rsquo;s second-quarter performance is likely to have been hurt by softening IT spending. The still-high interest rates and protracted inflationary conditions have impacted consumer spending. Meanwhile, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the cybersecurity players have already pointed out that organizations are delaying or taking more time in finalizing deals or even rightsizing deals in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment. This scenario may create a negative impact on CrowdStrike&rsquo;s sales growth in the to-be-reported quarter.</p><h2>Rising Expenses: A Drag on CRWD&rsquo;s Profitability</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As CrowdStrike battles slowing sales growth, its profitability is also under pressure due to rising expenses. The company has been aggressively investing in sales and marketing (S&amp;M) and research and development (R&amp;D) to maintain its competitive edge in the crowded cybersecurity market. While these investments are crucial for long-term growth, they are straining the company&#39;s bottom-line growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CrowdStrike&#39;s S&amp;M expenses have ballooned from $173 million in fiscal 2019 to a staggering $1.14 billion in fiscal 2024. This sharp increase reflects the company&#39;s commitment to expanding its sales force and boosting its market presence. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025 alone, S&amp;M expenses rose by approximately 25% year over year, a trend that is expected to continue in the second quarter.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">R&amp;D spending has also surged, with CrowdStrike increasing its investment nine-fold over the past six years. These expenses are vital for enhancing the company&#39;s cloud platform and staying ahead of competitors, but they are also eroding profitability. In the last reported quarter, R&amp;D expenses jumped by over 31% and similar levels of spending are expected for the second quarter.</p><h2>Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, CrowdStrike carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are <strong>PayPal</strong> PYPL, <strong>AudioEye</strong> AEYE and <strong>Aspen Technology</strong> AZPN, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&#39;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PayPal&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has been revised 19 cents upward to $4.42 per share in the past 30 days, which suggests a year-over-year decline of 13.3%. The company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 15.9%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AudioEye&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 10 cents to 47 cents per share in the past 30 days, which calls for an increase of 327.3% on a year-over-year basis. The company has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 25%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus mark for Aspen Technology&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 10.4% to $7.43 per share over the past 30 days, which indicates a 12.8% increase from 2023. The company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 13.1%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327924/crowdstrike-s-q2-earnings-growth-to-be-hit-by-sluggish-sales?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2327924">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

OUNZ</li><li>Podcast@Zacks.com</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode of ETF Spotlight, I speak with Imaru Casanova, Portfolio Manager for Gold and Precious Metals at VanEck, about the record-setting rally in gold and miners.</p><p>The price of gold has recently surged to an all-time high, surpassing $2,500 per troy ounce. Optimism around interest rate cuts and record purchases by central banks continue to boost gold.</p><p>Rising geopolitical tensions have also supported gold, which is seen as a safe haven in times of volatility and geopolitical stress. The precious metal is now up 22% year-to-date and has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 ETF SPY, which is up 19%.</p><p>Gold purchases by central banks have soared in recent years, particularly following Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. Central banks made net purchases of 1,037 tons last year, according to the World Gold Council, and continue to accumulate gold this year.</p><p>Rapidly rising debt and fiscal deterioration in the U.S. are among the reasons why central banks are diversifying away from the U.S. dollar.</p><p>In general, gold has historically performed better during periods of monetary easing. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of owning gold, thereby boosting its appeal, as the precious metal does not yield any income.</p><p>I believe gold deserves a small allocation in a portfolio mainly due to its diversification benefits. According to a Financial Times analysis, over the past 20 years or so, gold has provided better diversification benefits than bonds for an equity portfolio.</p><p>Gold equities, which had lagged behind the performance of the metal earlier this year, have been rising lately. Miners are generally high-beta plays on the price of gold.</p><p>The VanEck International Investors Gold Fund INIVX, which started back in 1968, is co-managed by Imaru. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF GDX is the largest gold mining ETF.</p><p>The SPDR Gold Trust GLD is the largest and most liquid gold ETF, with about $69 billion in AUM. For long-term focused investors, the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust GLDM and the iShares Gold Trust Micro IAUM are more suitable due to their ultra-low expense ratios.</p><p>Tune in to the podcast to learn more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327916/why-gold-prices-are-set-to-soar?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_spotlight-2327916">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lnrCHuJYvxM?rel=0" width="560"></iframe><p>It sure feels like there are only two phases for <strong>Tesla (</strong>TSLA<strong>)</strong> stock. It&rsquo;s either rocketing higher, going nearly parabolic like it did in the Spring of 2023 and mid-Summer this year, or it&rsquo;s slowly chopping its way lower with a series of descending highs and deeper lows. After pushing up from under $140 to over $270 in just three months, shares have started their descent.</p><p>On a day where Canada announced a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, matching US levels from May, Tesla gave up 3.2%. It failed to push through its 50-day moving average, and is now threatening to head even lower. While the move from $140 to $270 was swift, the move down to the $180s took less than a month. This lates move higher has now stalled and lows appear to be on the horizon.</p><p>In his video, Bartosiak employs technical analysis techniques to break down Tesla&rsquo;s recent price movements. Here&#39;s a glimpse of how he dissects the chart:</p><p><strong>Moving Averages</strong>: Bartosiak starts by examining the stock&#39;s moving averages, such as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. He points out the significance of crossovers and divergences between these averages, which can indicate potential trend changes.</p><p><strong>Support and Resistance Levels</strong>: Bartosiak identifies key support and resistance levels on the chart. These levels act as barriers that the stock price must breach or hold above, providing traders with critical decision points.</p><p><strong>Chart Patterns</strong>: He discusses chart patterns like head and shoulders, cup and handle, or flags, and their relevance in predicting future price movements. These patterns can offer valuable insights into potential bullish or bearish trends.</p><p><strong>Volume Analysis</strong>: He emphasizes the importance of volume analysis in confirming price trends. An increase in trading volume during a breakout or breakdown can validate the significance of a price move.</p><p>Dave Bartosiak&#39;s technical analysis approach adds depth to our understanding of Super Micro Computer&rsquo;s stock chart. By paying attention to moving averages, support and resistance levels, chart patterns, technical indicators, and volume, he equips investors with a comprehensive toolkit for making well-informed decisions in the stock market. Remember, while technical analysis is a valuable tool, it&#39;s important to consider other factors like fundamental analysis and market sentiment before making investment choices.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327911/dave-s-daily-chart-on-tesla?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-video_blog-2327911">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The bulls are in control as they look ahead to interest rate cuts and impressive technology-driven earnings growth. Wall Street blocks out nearly everything else since interest rates and earnings are the two largest factors that drive stock prices over the long haul.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Jay Powell and the Fed committed to start cutting interest rates next month with the S&amp;P 500 trading just below its all-time highs. </span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">There could be more selling and volatility in the near term with Wall Street possibly ready to take profits before or after the release of some key earnings reports and economic data later this week.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The uncertainty of the U.S. presidential election cycle might also lead to near-term choppiness. Still, the market-timing game is extremely difficult to navigate, making it imperative to stay constantly exposed to the stock market.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Today we explore how investors can use a Zacks screen to help find some of the best Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks to buy heading into September and the final months of 2024. &nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)&nbsp;</strong>stocks outperform the market in both good and bad times. However, there are over 200 stocks that earn a Zacks Rank #1 at any given time.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Therefore, it&rsquo;s helpful to understand how to apply filters to the Zacks Rank in order to narrow the list down to a more manageable and tradable set of stocks.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Parameters</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Clearly, there are only three items on this screen. But together, these three filters can result in some impressive returns.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>&bull; Zacks Rank equal to 1</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Starting with a Zacks Rank #1 is often a strong jumping off point because it boasts an average annual return of roughly 24.4% per year since 1988.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>&bull; % Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Positive current quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>&bull; % Broker Rating Change over 4 Week equal to Top # 5</strong></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Top 5 stocks with the best average broker rating changes over the last four weeks.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><em>This strategy comes loaded with the Research Wizard and is called bt_sow_filtered zacks rank5.

Robinhood transformed into a widely popular trading platform during the initial Covid market rebound and subsequent bull run. Since then, Robinhood has rolled out retirement accounts, a credit card, and more to add to its trading platform, which includes crypto.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c3/75610.jpg?v=825328211" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Robinhood grew its average revenue per user by 35% year-over-year to $113 in the second quarter, with its Gold Subscribers soaring 61% to 2.0 million. Robinhood crushed our adjusted second-quarter earnings estimate on August 7 by 40% and raised its outlook. HOOD&rsquo;s consensus earnings estimates for FY24 and FY25 surged by 36% and 31%, respectively since its Q2 release.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">HOOD is projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$0.61 a share last year to +$0.76 a share in 2024. Meanwhile, its revenue is expected to pop 43% in FY24 and 9% higher in FY25 to hit $2.90 billion vs. $1.9 billion in 2023.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f4/75615.jpg?v=971277753" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Robinhood shares have climbed 100% in the past year.

<![CDATA[ Regency Starts Safeway-Anchored Oakley Shops' Development ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Regency Centers</strong> REG recently announced the opening of Oakley Shops at Laurel Fields, a new ground-up development anchored by Safeway in Oakley, CA.</p><p>Oakley Shops represents Regency&#39;s first development in the Northern California submarket and will encompass around 79,000 square feet of retail space. This development will be located at the signalized intersection of Laurel Road and O&rsquo;Hara Avenue, aiming to fill the gap of insufficient high-quality retail and grocery options in the surrounding area.</p><p>Safeway is set to occupy around 56,000 square feet at Oakley Shops, with an additional 23,000 square feet dedicated to quality retail, restaurant and essential services. Several prospective merchants are presently engaged in different stages of lease negotiations and discussions, with further announcements expected in the near future.</p><p>Regency is well-poised to benefit from its strategically located portfolio of premium shopping centers, concentrated in affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas where consumers have high spending power. Over the years, the company has made several developments in the key markets of the United States to bolster growth.</p><p>In the second quarter, REG started approximately $40 million of new development and redevelopment projects, bringing total project starts to $120 million since the beginning of the year through Aug. 1, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, Regency Centers&rsquo; in-process development and redevelopment projects had estimated net project costs of $578 million. Given the company&rsquo;s prudent financial management, it is well-poised to capitalize on such opportunities.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Given the prime location of the property and its popularity, it is likely to draw in substantial consumer footfall and drive sales, making the move strategic for Regency.</p><p>Over the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 20.2% compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 14.4%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/37/75606.jpg?v=67651740" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Other Stocks to Consider</h2><p>Some other top-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are <strong>Simon Property Trust</strong> SPG and <strong>Tanger.

<![CDATA[ EastGroup Announces a 10.2% Dividend Hike: Is This Hike Sustainable? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 17:29:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>EastGroup Properties</strong> EGP announced a hike of 10.2% in its quarterly dividend, raising it to $1.40 per share from $1.27 paid earlier. The increased dividend will be paid out on Oct. 15 to shareholders on record as of Sep. 30, 2024.</p><p>Based on the increase, the annual dividend rate now comes to $5.60 a share, resulting in an annualized yield of 2.99%, considering EastGroup&rsquo;s closing price of $187 on Aug. 26.</p><p>Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest enticements for REIT investors, and EastGroup Properties is committed to boosting shareholder wealth. The company has hiked its dividend in each of the last 13 years. The recent dividend hike marks its 179th consecutive quarterly distribution to shareholders. Further, EGP increased or maintained its dividend for 32 consecutive years and hiked it for 29 years during this period.</p><p>In the last five years, EastGroup has increased its dividend seven times, and the annualized dividend growth rate for this period is 15.88%. This is attractive to income investors and represents a steady income stream. Check EastGroup Properties&rsquo; dividend history here.</p><h2>EGP&rsquo;s Stock Fundamentals &amp; Financial Performance</h2><p>This industrial REIT focuses on the development, acquisition and operation of industrial properties in major Sunbelt markets throughout the United States. With its focus on the ownership of premier distribution facilities usually clustered near major transportation features in supply-constrained submarkets, EastGroup has a well-leased industrial portfolio.</p><p>The company&rsquo;s operating portfolio was 97.4% leased and 97.1% occupied as of June 30, 2024. Also, the average occupancy of the operating portfolio was 97.0% for the second quarter of 2024.</p><p>EastGroup has a decent earnings performance. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, matched on one occasion and missed on the remaining quarter on funds from operations (FFO) per share basis, the average surprise being 0.14%. Over the next five years, the company&rsquo;s FFO per share is projected to grow at a rate of 8.0%.</p><p>This industrial REIT churns a cash flow of $8.02 per share compared with the industry&rsquo;s average of $1.69. Moreover, EastGroup Properties&rsquo; return on equity (&ldquo;ROE&rdquo;) is 8.69%, significantly higher than the industry&rsquo;s ROE of 3.26%.</p><h2>Industrial REIT Outlook</h2><p>Amid an e-commerce boom, companies are making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, propelling demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks. This is aiding the industrial real estate market to prosper.</p><p>Apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, industrial real estate space is anticipated to gain traction over the long run from a likely rise in the inventory levels. Given EGP&rsquo;s solid capacity to offer modern logistics facilities, it is well-poised to bank on this trend.</p><h2>EGP&rsquo;s Conclusion</h2><p>Particularly for EastGroup, we believe such distribution activity highlights the company&rsquo;s operational strength and commitment to rewarding its shareholders handsomely.</p><p>The latest hike reflects EastGroup&rsquo;s high-quality portfolio and its ability to generate solid cash flow growth through its operating platform.</p><p>Investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments to put their money on. Such moves will boost investors&rsquo; confidence in the stock.</p><p>Over the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 17.3% compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 19.2%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/eb/75601.jpg?v=55315687" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Stocks to Consider</h2><p>Some better-ranked stocks from the broader REIT sector are <strong>Cousins Properties</strong> CUZ and <strong>Lamar Advertising</strong> LAMR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cousins Properties&rsquo; 2024 FFO per share has moved marginally northward over the past month to $2.66.</p><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lamar Advertising&rsquo;s current-year FFO per share has been marginally raised over the past month to $8.09.</p><p>Note: <em>Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327882/eastgroup-announces-a-10-2-dividend-hike-is-this-hike-sustainable?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_finance_sector-2327882">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

Its earnings are expected to register growth of 12% in 2024 and 15.5% in 2025.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Corpay, Inc.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>MercadoLibre </strong>MELI has shown impressive resilience and growth, with its share price increasing 25.7% in the past month. This stellar performance underscores investor confidence in the company&#39;s strong fundamentals despite broader economic uncertainties.<br /><br />MELI&rsquo;s gain not only compared favorably with the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry&rsquo;s decline of 1.6% over the same period but also outpaced the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s returns of 2.6% and 2.7%, respectively.<br /><br />The outperformance can be attributed to MercadoLibre&rsquo;s robust second-quarter 2024 results that primarily benefited from strong e-commerce and fintech businesses, and growing advertising revenues. It also reflects MELI&#39;s continued success in the execution of business strategies and maintaining its leading position in the Latin America (LATAM) e-commerce space.<br /><br />In the second quarter, total revenues were driven by accelerating commerce and fintech revenues, which grew 53.4% and 27.5% year over year, respectively. Revenues from MELI&rsquo;s advertising services grew 51% on a year-over-year basis.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">One-Month Price Performance</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6d/75613.jpg?v=671453651" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given such impressive results amid macroeconomic headwinds, the question arises of how investors should play the MELI stock at present.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Expanding Logistic Operations Act as Key Catalyst for MELI</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">MercadoLibre&rsquo;s expanding logistic operations are shaping up the growth trajectory of its e-commerce business. Its logistics network plays a vital role in enabling e-commerce across LATAM.&nbsp;<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s strong efforts to expand outside of LATAM, especially in the United States, are noteworthy. In the quarter ending in June, MELI launched a fulfillment center in Texas to bring U.S. sellers into its ecosystem in order to boost the assortment of products for customers in Mexico.<br /><br />On the back of this move, customers in north Mexico are receiving their orders from the United States within a couple of days for free.<br /><br />In June 2024, MercadoLibre introduced robotics in its distribution center in Cajamar. It intends to deploy more than 300 robots by the end of this year. These robots will manage tasks like transporting shelves containing products from storage areas, which will optimize processing time by 20% and increase total storage capacity by up to 15% per square meter. These robots are capable of handling up to 20,000 items and 2,500 shelves per day, helping automate repetitive tasks like product sorting.<br /><br />MercadoLibre introduced a concept called slower shipment service with its SLOW in order to bring flexibility to its logistic operations. SLOW offers shipping options for buyers who opt for slower shipping options. With SLOW shipments, the shipping window becomes larger and more flexible for MELI.<br /><br />The company came up with another innovation called MELI Delivery Day in order to reduce its last-mile delivery costs. With the option of MELI Delivery Day, several deliveries at a single address can be made on a single drop.<br /><br />MercadoLibre&rsquo;s growing investment in technology and innovation reflects its commitment to building an efficient logistic network to deliver enhanced shopping experiences to customers.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fintech Business Strength Drives MELI&rsquo;s Growth</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Solid momentum in its Mercado Pago fintech platform, which allows users to send and receive payments seamlessly, is a major positive. Its solid credit business is contributing well to the company&rsquo;s fintech growth.<br /><br />MercadoLibre&rsquo;s strong efforts to deliver an enhanced experience to Mercado Pago users are positive. Strength in assets under management and the Mercado Pago credit card is crucial for boosting user engagement of Mercado Pago. In second-quarter 2024, fintech monthly active users totaled 52 million, up 37.3% year over year.<br /><br />The company is leveraging its rich data to cross-sell in the LATAM region and bolster its fintech business. The data also enables MELI to have a better view of credit risks and operate a business that matches the lowest cost-to-serve in the region.<br /><br />A strengthening fintech business is vital for MELI&rsquo;s TPV growth. In the same quarter, TPV surged 86.2% year over year on a FX-neutral basis to $46.33 billion.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rising Estimates Act as a Positive for MercadoLibre</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">MercadoLibre&rsquo;s long-term prospects are expected to benefit from strengthening commerce and fintech businesses.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 is pegged at $20.21 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 39.7%. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings stands at $34.70 per share, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 78.3%. Earnings estimates have moved north by 4% over the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c5/75614.jpg?v=130633628" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Lofty Valuation Concerns MELI</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite MercadoLibre&#39;s strong fundamentals, its valuation is worrisome. The stock&#39;s current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is significantly higher than the industry average, indicating a stretched valuation. This leaves little room for error and makes the stock particularly vulnerable to any negative developments or earnings misses.<br /><br />The MELI stock is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 4.37X compared with the industry&rsquo;s 1.73X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/77/75612.jpg?v=819079429" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">MELI Faces Headwinds</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Market uncertainties, high inflation, recessionary fears and weakening macro conditions are headwinds for MercadoLibre.<br /><br />Margins are currently under pressure due to increased investments in free shipping, loyalty programs, and improvement in customer services, marketing and chargebacks, as well as higher maintenance, hosting and fraud prevention.<br /><br />Although MELI has a strong foothold in the online retail market of LATAM, rising competitive pressure from the e-commerce giant <strong>Amazon </strong>AMZN, which is making strong efforts to expand its presence in LATAM, is concerning. MELI also faces intense competition from the retail behemoth <strong>Walmart </strong>WMT, which is making good progress in the region, especially in Mexico.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">MercadoLibre&rsquo;s e-commerce strength, on the back of its expanding logistics network, is hard to ignore. Its well-performing fintech business is another positive.&nbsp;<br /><br />However, challenging macroeconomic conditions, persistent inflation and intensifying competition are concerning. The company&rsquo;s lofty valuation makes its near-term prospects foggy.<br /><br />MaercadoLibre currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GMS Inc. </strong>GMS is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug. 29, before market open.<br /><br />In the last reported quarter, the company&rsquo;s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.4% and declined 8.5% year over year. Net sales missed the consensus mark by 0.4% but increased 8.4% year over year.<br /><br />GMS&rsquo; earnings topped the consensus mark in two of the last four quarters and missed on two occasions, delivering an average negative surprise of 0.8%.</p><h2>The Trend in Estimate Revision</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS) has remained stable at $2.11 in the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 12.1% drop from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s level of $2.40.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>GMS Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3> <img alt="GMS Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="263" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/35/1724771682.png" title="" width="537" /> <p>GMS Inc. price-eps-surprise | GMS Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">The consensus mark for net sales is pegged at $1.49 billion, indicating a 5.6% rise from the year-ago period.</p><h2>Key Factors to Note</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The top-line performance of GMS is expected to have gained year over year on the back of improving single-family demand patterns. Also, the growing contributions from the acquired businesses are likely to have been encouraging for the uptrend. However, declining multi-family and commercial demand patterns might have reflected in the company&rsquo;s diverse product categories&rsquo; fiscal first-quarter sales performance.<br /><br />Product category-wise, the company expects Wallboard volume to be up in low-to-mid single digits and pricing to be flat year over year. Ceilings volume is likely to be up in the low-to-mid teens while pricing is anticipated to be up in the low-to-mid single digits. Steel Framing is expected to be in the low-to-mid single digits while pricing is anticipated to be in the low teens. Complementary Product&rsquo;s sales growth is anticipated to be in the mid-single digits, including the benefits of recent acquisitions.<br /><br />Overall, GMS expects sales growth to be in the mid-single digits.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate of net sales for Wallboard, Ceilings, Steel Framing and Complementary Product is pegged at $605.5 million, $206.7 million, $224.8 million and $455.9 million, respectively. In the year-ago period, these segments reported net sales of $571.4 million, $175.2 million, $236.76 million and $426.2 million, respectively.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the bottom line is likely to have declined year over year, primarily due to increased labor expenses and inflationary pressure on wages and benefits. Also, the company anticipates some near-term headwinds, particularly in Wallboard and Steel margins.<br /><br />For the fiscal first quarter, GMS expects a gross margin of nearly 31.5%, net income of $77-$79 million and adjusted EBITDA of $160-$165 million. In the year-ago period, the company reported a gross margin of 32%, net income of $89.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of $173.3 million.<br /><br />GMS&rsquo; strategic initiatives, diverse product portfolio and continuous search for accretive inorganic opportunities are likely to have benefited its performance.</p><h2>What the Zacks Model Unveils</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model doesn&rsquo;t conclusively predict an earnings beat for GMS this time around. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as elaborated below.<br /><br /><strong>Earnings ESP</strong>: The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.84%. You can uncover the best stocks before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank</strong>: GMS currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p><h3>Recent Releases</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Williams-Sonoma Inc.</strong> WSM reported mixed results for second-quarter fiscal 2024 (ended July 30, 2024).<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but net revenues missed the same. On a year-over-year basis, the top line declined but the bottom line increased on the back of the two-for-one stock split completed in July.<br /><br /><strong>Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.</strong> RRGB posted mixed second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues beating the same.<br /><br />The top line increased year over year while the bottom line fell from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s level.<br /><br /><strong>Brinker International, Inc.</strong> EAT reported mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues beating the same.<br /><br />In fiscal 2025, management anticipates total revenues to be in the range of $4.55-$4.62 billion. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the $195-$215 million band. EAT projects fiscal 2025 EPS to be in the range of $3.8-$4, down from the prior estimate of $4.35-$4.75.<br /><br />Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327912/gms-gears-up-to-report-q1-earnings-factors-to-consider?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2327912">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Corporation</strong> GLDD announced multiple dredging contracts, worth $256.2 million. Such capital, coastal protection and maintenance work allow the company to improve the country&rsquo;s environment, coastlines and infrastructure.<br /><br />The first contract is the Mobile Harbor, AL Deepening and Widening Dredging Project 2A, received from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District. The scope of the work includes deepening the channel by six feet to improve channel navigation, which will allow deeper draft vessels to use the port and reuse material in the Sand Island Beneficial Use Area. It is expected to begin in the fourth quarter and close in the spring of 2025.<br /><br />The second contract is the Port Everglades Sand Bypass Project to renourish beach in Broward County, FL, with a renewable local source of sand. The work involves the construction of a sand trap on the north side of the Port inlet to collect sand that would otherwise be lost through erosion and offshore transport. Accumulated sand can be then harvested for future beach placement. The project is expected to start in the second half of 2025 with estimated completion in 2026. The contract value was included in the second-quarter backlog.<br /><br />The third contract, which was given by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District, is the Barnegat Inlet to Little Egg Inlet, Long Beach Island Beach Renourishment Project. The work entails placing beach fill to repair the dune and berm system along the Atlantic Ocean coastline of Long Beach Island, NJ. This project has potential options pending of approximately $63.8 million. Work will likely start in the fourth quarter and is expected to finish in third-quarter 2025. The deal was in low bids pending at the end of the second quarter.<br /><br />The Fire Island Inlet Dredging Project is the fourth contract and is provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District. The work includes emergency beach fill and shore protection to multiple communities along Fire Island, NY. Work is expected to start in the fourth quarter and is estimated to be completed in the first half of 2025.<br /><br />The fifth contract, the North Wildwood, NJ&rsquo;s Emergency Beach Renourishment Project, was given by the Department of Transportation and was awarded, performed and completed in the second quarter of 2024. It aimed to provide sand on the North Wildwood beaches to protect shore properties and ensure a safer shoreline for residents and visitors.<br /><br />Lastly, the St. Lucie Inlet Maintenance Dredging Project contract, which was included in the first-quarter backlog, aims to maintain the dredging of the entrance channel and impoundment basin. This was provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District. Work on this project started in July and is estimated to be completed in the third quarter of 2024.<br /><br />Along with these contracts, Great Lakes has approximately $318 million in low bids and options pending award, which brings the potential total pipeline of work to more than $1.2 billion.<br /><br />On Aug. 26, its shares jumped 8.5% in the day trading session.</p><h2>Price Performance of GLDD Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Great Lakes has outperformed the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry in the past three months.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/16/75588.jpg?v=1926603430" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Great Lakes is the largest provider of dredging services in the United States. The company mainly banks on strong domestic dredging operations, high equipment utilization, solid project execution and savings from restructuring.<br /><br />GLDD continued to bid on projects and build a solid backlog for the second quarter. Great Lakes ended the second quarter with $807.9 million in dredging backlog compared with $1.04 billion at 2023-end. Of the reported backlog, capital projects comprised 71.2%.<br /><br />It expects the dredging bid market to remain robust for the remainder of 2024. We believe the company&rsquo;s strong bidding ability and project execution, along with improved market conditions, fleet adjustment and cost reduction initiatives, will boost its performance in 2024 and beyond.</p><h2>GLDD&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">GLDD currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.<br /><br />Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space are <strong>EMCOR Group Inc. </strong>EME, <strong>MasTec, Inc.</strong> MTZ and <strong>Granite Construction Incorporated</strong> GVA.&nbsp;<br /><br />EMCOR, which currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1, has surged 69.7% over the past year. Also, 2024 earnings per share (EPS) estimates have increased to $18.00 from $16.30 over the past 60 days. EPS for 2024 is expected to grow 34.9%. EME&#39;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 36.5%. It carries an impressive VGM Score of B. VGM Score helps to identify stocks with the most attractive value, growth and momentum.<br /><br />MasTec, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 2, has gained 12.3% over the past year. EPS estimates for 2024 have increased to $3.02 from $2.95 over the past 30 days.&nbsp; EPS for 2024 is expected to grow 53.3%. MTZ beat on earnings in three of the trailing four quarters but missed on one occasion, the average surprise being 19.4%. It carries an impressive VGM Score of A.<br /><br />GVA, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 2, has gained 79.9% over the past year. Its 2024 EPS estimates have increased to $5.24 from $4.76 over the past 30 days. EPS for 2024 is expected to grow 66.9%.

<![CDATA[ Top Stock Reports for Toyota Motor, IBM & Stryker ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 17:03:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Tuesday, August 27, 2024</strong><br /><br />The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today&#39;s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Toyota Motor Corporation (TM), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and Stryker Corporation (SYK), as well a micro-cap stock Fossil Group, Inc. (FOSL). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.<br /><br />These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.<br /><br />You can <strong>see all of today&rsquo;s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong><br /><br /><strong>Toyota Motor</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry over the past year (+8.0% vs. -9.1%). The company&rsquo;s robust lineup of trucks and sport utility vehicles is set to fuel sales. To capitalize on the global shift to environment-friendly vehicles, the auto giant is deepening its focus on manufacturing hybrid, electric and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, which will bolster the company&rsquo;s product competitiveness.<br /><br />It aims to expand global sales of BEVs to 1.5 million units in 2026 and 3.5 million units a year by 2030. Toyota&rsquo;s commitment to maximizing shareholders&rsquo; value via dividends and buybacks is also praiseworthy.<br /><br />However, labor cost inflation is expected to continue to weigh on margins. Rising debt levels, along with high R&amp;D expenses and capex, might pose challenges. Also, Toyota expects sales in Japan to decrease, given the lower shipments of Daihatsu. Thus, the stock warrants a cautious stance now.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Toyota Motor here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br />Shares of <strong>IBM</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry over the past year (+41.0% vs. +32.2%). The company is poised to benefit from strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in Software and Consulting. Its growth is expected to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing, and security in the long haul.<br /><br />A combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investment in growth opportunities will likely drive profitability. The infrastructure segment is benefiting from broad-based demand for hybrid and distributed infrastructure, especially IBM Z. Improved cybersecurity operations will likely bring long-term benefits.<br /><br />However, net sales in the Consulting segment are impacted by a pullback in discretionary spending. Although IBM generates significant cash flow, a high debt level can jeopardize its ability to sustain dividend payout. Fierce competition remains a concern.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on IBM here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br /><strong>Stryker</strong> shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Products industry over the past year (+28.6% vs. +15.8%). The company exited second-quarter 2024 on a strong note with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company witnessed strong performance across its segments in the United States. Strong International sales also buoy optimism.<br /><br />The momentum is expected to continue in 2024 on the back of ongoing procedural recovery and a strong order book for capital equipment. Stryker&rsquo;s prospects in 2024 seem promising on the back of strong customer demand for its existing products as well as new launches. The company&rsquo;s guidance for earnings and revenues appears encouraging. A solid solvency position is a plus.<br /><br />However, inflationary pressure and supply-chain challenges continue to plague Stryker. Stiff competition in the MedTech space remains a woe. Contraction in both gross and operating margin is a woe.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Stryker here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br />Shares of <strong>Fossil&rsquo;s</strong> have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry over the past six months (+8.6% vs. -0.1%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $62.17 million have seen gross margin expanded by 340 bps for the 26 weeks ended June 29, 2024, driven by SKU rationalization, pricing adjustments and exiting the lower-margin smartwatch category under the TAG Plan.<br /><br />Further margin expansion is anticipated in the second half of 2024. The company also reduced SG&amp;A expenses by 19.1%, narrowing the adjusted operating loss by 32% year over year, and is on track to achieve $100 million in annualized benefits. Fossil&#39;s liquidity improved to $156 million, aided by a $57 million tax refund and a 38% reduction in inventory.<br /><br />Strategic exits from the smartwatch category and store closures have optimized operations, contributing to gross margin gains. Despite these positives, net sales declined 20% due to strategic shifts, with a $100 million negative impact expected for the full year. Pressure on licensed watch brands and high debt levels present ongoing challenges.<br /><br />(You can <strong>read the full research report on Fossil here &gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>)<br /><br />Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include ConocoPhillips (COP), Altria Group, Inc. (MO) and Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS).<br /><br />Director of Research<br /><br />Sheraz Mian<br /><br /><em>Note: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings. He is frequently quoted in the print and electronic media and publishes the weekly <strong>Earnings Trends</strong> and <strong>Earnings Preview</strong> reports.

Yet significant reliance on crude and rising operational costs pose a concern.</p><p>Altria Group (MO) Gains From Solid Pricing Amid Low Volumes<br>Per the Zacks analyst, Altria Group has been benefiting from its solid pricing power. In second quarter, higher pricing offered respite to revenues, which was otherwise hurt by low cigarette volumes.</p><p>Synopsys (SNPS) Banks on Strong Product Menu, Contract Wins<br>Per the Zacks analyst, Synopsys' focus on strengthening its product portfolio is helping it cater to the growing demand in the EDA market. Deal wins at leading semiconductor companies is a tailwind.</p><p>FDA Nod to Sarepta's (SRPT) DMD Gene Therapy Fuels Growth<br>The Zacks Analyst is encouraged by the FDA's recent label expansion to Sarepta's Elevidys, the first gene therapy for DMD. The therapy is now approved to treat all DMD patients aged four and older.</p><p>Strong Macau Business Aid Wynn Resorts (WYNN), High Cost Ail<br>Per the Zacks analyst, Wynn Resorts is benefiting from an uptick in visitation and demand particularly in the Macau region. However, rise in operating expenses is a concern for the company.</p><p>Focus on R&D Aids Merit Medical (MMSI) Amid Forex Volatility<br>The Zacks analyst is upbeat about Merit Medical's continued focus on research and development (R&D) in recent times despite its business being exposed to foreign exchange volatility.</p><p>Reliable Assets, Customer Increase Aid Southwest Gas (SWX)<br>Per the Zacks analyst, Southwest Gas' investment in infrastructure is making its assets more reliable.

Solid capital position supports capital deployment.</p><p>Loan Demand, Fee Income, High Rates Aid BankUnited (BKU)<br>Per the Zacks analyst, decent loan demand, high rates and focus on fee income will keep aiding BankUnited's top line. A solid balance sheet and liquidity position will support capital distributions.</p><p><b>New Downgrades</b></p><p>Ryanair's (RYAAY) Prospects Hurt by High Operating Costs<br>The Zacks analyst is worried about the fact that high operating costs are hurting Ryanair's bottom line. Escalated labor and fuel costs are pushing up total expenses. </p><p> Lower Global Vehicle Production & High R&D to Ail Lear (LEA)<br>Per the Zacks analyst, an expected decline in global vehicle production is likely to hit Lear's sales and core operating earnings in 2024. Rising engineering and launch costs are also concerning.</p><p>Slowdown in Sensing Solutions, High Debt Ails Sensata (ST)<br>Per the Zacks analyst, Sensata's performance is affected by a slowdown in the Sensing solutions segment due to forex issues. High-debt burden is an added concern.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2327718/top-stock-reports-for-toyota-motor-ibm-stryker?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-research_daily-2327718">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aflac Incorporated</strong> AFL is aided by a strong U.S. business, product launches and upgrades coupled with expanding cash reserves.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AFL&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AFL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock has gained 44.2% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s 37.1% growth. The Finance sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite index have risen 27.9% and 26.7%, respectively, in the same time frame.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/12/75611.jpg?v=68185690" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Robust Growth Prospects for Aflac Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AFL&rsquo;s 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.73 per share, indicating growth of 8% from the prior-year figure. The consensus mark for 2025 earnings is pegged at $7.06 per share, indicating growth of 4.8% from the 2024 estimate.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Northbound Estimate Revision of AFL</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised 4.5% upward in the past 30 days.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Decent Earnings Surprise History for AFL Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AFL&rsquo;s bottom line outpaced estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, the average surprise being 8.24%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Solid Return on Equity of AFL</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Return on equity in the trailing 12 months is 16.2% for Aflac, higher than the industry&rsquo;s average of 16.1%. This substantiates the company&rsquo;s efficiency in utilizing shareholders&rsquo; funds.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Key Business Tailwinds for Aflac</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Aflac&#39;s revenues are bolstered by strong sales in its U.S. segment, driven by strategic growth investments, robust persistency rates and enhanced productivity. Through its Japan and U.S. segments, the company designs and markets supplemental insurance products across both countries. Increased sales of these products are likely to boost its premiums in the days ahead, which are a key contributor to an insurer&rsquo;s revenue growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Aflac introduces new products and upgrades existing ones to address the changing needs of its customers. In July 2024, it partnered with SKYGEN to enhance the management of dental and vision benefits, leveraging advanced technology and streamlined processes to boost customer satisfaction and product sales. A month before, Aflac collaborated with Empathy to provide grief and administrative support services to clients of Aflac Group Life, Absence and Disability Solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company also integrates digital solutions into its offerings to align with the ongoing trend of digitization. Aflac&rsquo;s significant investments in digital transformation have improved operational efficiencies and facilitated a shift to digital sales channels, which could continue to support strong profit margins in the days ahead.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Aflac&rsquo;s solid financial position, supported by a strong cash balance and substantial cash flow, is a key strength. As of June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents surged 40.7% from the 2023-end level. In the first half of 2024, Aflac generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flows. This financial stability enables the company to pursue growth initiatives and engage in prudent capital deployment through share repurchases and dividend payments.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Gogo Business Aviation, the aviation operations of <strong>Gogo Inc.</strong> GOGO, recently announced that it has inked a definitive partnership with Skyservice Business Aviation to receive Supplemental Type Certificates (&ldquo;STCs&rdquo;) from Transport Canada Civil Aviation (&ldquo;TCCA&rdquo;) and the Federal Aviation Administration (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;) for the deployment of cutting-edge Gogo 5G technology across six aircraft models.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This collaborative effort is aimed at enhancing air-to-ground (ATG) inflight entertainment and connectivity (IFEC) service across North America, thereby showcasing the companies&rsquo; commitment to technological advancement.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">GOGO-Skyservice Collaboration Payouts</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The STCs will likely allow operators to install an AVANCE L5 system and two MB13 phased-array antennas on their aircraft, with provisions for an easy upgrade to the forthcoming AVANCE LX5 in the second quarter of 2025. Per the terms of the partnership, the North American business aviation company, Skyservice has successfully obtained TCCA STCs for the Gulfstream G280 and Embraer Legacy 450/500 aircrafts, with FAA validations pending. STCs for additional aircraft models, including the Cessna Citation CJ3/3+, Bombardier Challenger 300/350, Bombardier Challenger 604/605 and Cessna Citation X, are in various stages of development.<br /><br />In today&rsquo;s digital era, the demand for inflight connectivity is rapidly growing as passengers expect reliable connections for activities such as streaming, web browsing and more. Gogo&#39;s advanced 5G network, supported by more than 159 sites, including nine in Canada, promises to deliver superior IFEC services. The company is currently accepting orders for 5G upgrades and offering substantial incentives for operators looking to upgrade to the AVANCE system.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Will GOGO Stock Benefit From the Collaboration?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">This partnership between Gogo and Skyservice marks a major leap forward in inflight connectivity. By securing STCs for Gogo 5G across a diverse range of aircraft models, the collaboration is set to deliver cutting-edge, high-speed connectivity to North American operators. Further, the expansion of Gogo&rsquo;s 5G network and the upcoming transition to LTE technology also underscore the company&rsquo;s commitment to delivering cutting-edge communication solutions. This, in turn, will likely generate incremental revenues for the company and augment its market position in the region.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">GOGO Stock Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Gogo have lost 29.1% over the past year against the industry&rsquo;s growth of 35.1%. Earnings estimates for Gogo have declined from 39 cents per share to 33 cents per share for 2024 and from 62 cents per share to 51 cents per share for 2025 over the past 60 days.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c3/75581.jpg?v=472158662" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">GOGO&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Gogo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).&nbsp;<br /><br />Some better-ranked stocks in the broader industry have been discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Arista Networks, Inc.</strong> ANET, holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, supplies products to a prestigious set of customers, including Fortune 500 global companies in markets such as cloud titans, enterprises, financials and specialty cloud service providers.

<![CDATA[ AXIS Capital Rallies 38% YTD: Can the Stock Retain the Momentum? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <strong>AXIS Capital Holdings </strong>AXS have rallied 38.4% year to date, compared with the industry&rsquo;s increase of 26.2%, the Finance sector&rsquo;s rise of 13.4% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite&rsquo;s rise of 18.2%. With a market capitalization of $2.8 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.5 million.<br /><br />A compelling and diversified product portfolio, underwriting excellence, digital capabilities and solid capital position continue to drive the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) specialty and global reinsurer. It has a VGM Score of A.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">AXS Outperforms Industry, Sector, S&amp;P 500</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/95/75599.jpg?v=402548139" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>AXS Witnessing Northbound Estimate Revision</h2><p>All four analysts covering the stock raised estimates for the current and next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Axis Capital&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings has moved 6.9% and 5.1% north, respectively, in the past 30 days, reflecting analyst optimism.&nbsp;</p><h2>Factors Acting in Favor of AXS</h2><p>AXIS Capital envisions being a leading specialty underwriter and thus focuses on growth areas, including wholesale insurance and lower middle markets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Its exit from the volatile catastrophe and property reinsurance space and reducing risk exposure while concentrating on accident and health, excess and supply property, casualty, credit and surety, and specialty reinsurance lines bodes well for growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Insurance segment is poised to benefit from a diversified portfolio of global specialty businesses, leadership positions and growth opportunities across major business lines. This segment has been doing well over the last several years. Net premiums written (NPW) have been growing and we expect the 2026 NPW to increase at a three-year CAGR of 7.6%.<br /><br />The Reinsurance business should benefit from strong cycle management, focusing on improving the business mix. We expect the 2026 NPW to increase at a three-year CAGR of 9.1%.<br /><br />AXIS Capital is also working with its distribution partners to use expanding digital capabilities to create new business growth in desirable smaller accounts. This, coupled with simplifying operating structure, delivering efficiencies and capitalizing on productivity gains, should help it achieve a general and administrative ratio of less than 11% by 2026.<br /><br />Strategic initiatives have been driving improvement in its operating earnings over the past few years.&nbsp;</p><h2>Optimistic Growth Projection for AXS</h2><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $10.70, indicating an increase of 8.6% on 7% higher revenues of $6.1 billion. The consensus estimate for 2025 earnings is pegged at $11.59, indicating an increase of 8.4% on 10% higher revenues of $6.7 billion. &nbsp;<br /><br />The expected long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 27.8%, better than the industry average of 11%. We expect 2026 EPS to witness a three-year CAGR of 9.4%.</p><h2>Axis Capital&rsquo;s Impressive Dividend History</h2><p>Axis Capital&#39;s dividend track is impressive. It hiked its dividend for 18 straight years and currently yields 2.3%, way above the industry average of 0.3%. The insurer boasts one of the highest dividend yields among its peers.&nbsp;</p><h2>AXS&rsquo; Return on Capital</h2><p>AXS&rsquo; trailing 12-month return on equity is 19.7%, ahead of the industry average of 8%. Return on equity, a profitability measure, reflects how effectively a company is utilizing its shareholders.&nbsp;<br /><br />Also, the return on invested capital (ROIC) in the trailing 12 months was 11.1%, better than the industry average of 5.9%. Its ROIC has been increasing over the last few quarters amid capital investment made over the same time frame. This reflects the company&rsquo;s efficiency in utilizing funds to generate income.&nbsp;</p><h2>Axis Capital Shares Are Undervalued&nbsp;</h2><p>AXS shares are trading at a price-to-book multiple of 1.3, lower than the industry average of 1.6.<br /><br />Its pricing at a discount to the industry average gives a better entry point to investors. Also, it has a Value Score of A.&nbsp;</p><h2>Other Stocks to Consider&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</h2><p>Some other top-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are <strong>Heritage Insurance </strong>HRTG, <strong>Mercury General </strong>MCY and <strong>ProAssurance Corporation </strong>PRA, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />Heritage Insurance earnings surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed in one, the average beat being 49.15%. Year to date, HRTG has rallied 141.1%.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HRTG&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings implies 10.3% and 18.1% year-over-year growth, respectively.&nbsp;<br /><br />Mercury General&#39;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 3,539.06%. Year to date, MCY&rsquo;s stock has surged 68.9%.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MCY&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings indicates 1,233.3% and 50% year-over-year growth, respectively.&nbsp;<br /><br />ProAssurance earnings surpassed estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed in the other two. Year to date, PRA&rsquo;s stock has lost 1.1%.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PRA&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings suggests 457.1% and 49.2% year-over-year growth, respectively.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327874/axis-capital-rallies-38-ytd-can-the-stock-retain-the-momentum?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|price_surge_/_plunge-2327874">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ IBM to Shut Down China R&D Operations: Will the Stock Benefit? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Per a Bloomberg release, <strong>International Business Machines Corporation</strong> IBM has recently decided to completely shut down its research and development (R&amp;D) operations in China. This decision followed geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, affecting more than 1,000 IBM employees.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">A Strategic Shift for IBM?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The closure, a part of IBM&rsquo;s strategy to better serve its global clients, reflects the decreasing significance of the Chinese market for U.S. tech firms, as local clients increasingly favor domestic providers. The decision also underscores IBM&#39;s focus on expanding profit margins amid a competitive global landscape.<br /><br />As the Chinese economy faces a downturn and regulatory scrutiny intensifies, many other foreign firms have started shifting operations abroad. Foreign investments in China have slowed down due to concerns over Beijing&#39;s preference for local technology providers. The hardware sector is particularly sensitive in the current geopolitical climate, with the Sino-US conflict over crucial technologies, including semiconductors and artificial intelligence.<br /><br />The China-based team, which specializes in developing hardware, such as servers and storage systems, will likely see its functions transferred to other countries, with India being a primary recipient of these operations.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Will IBM Gain From the Proposed Move?</h2><p>The company&rsquo;s growth is expected to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing, and security in the long haul. A combination of a better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investment in growth opportunities will likely drive profitability.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">IBM Stock Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of IBM have risen 35.6% over the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 25.4%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ed/75591.jpg?v=337351803" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank of IBM and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">IBM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).&nbsp;<br /><br />Some better-ranked stocks in the broader industry have been discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Arista Networks, Inc.</strong> ANET, holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, supplies products to a prestigious set of customers, including Fortune 500 global companies in markets such as cloud titans, enterprises and financials, and specialty cloud service providers.

<![CDATA[ ExxonMobil Warns of Oil Supply Risks, Prices Could Surge 5X ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Exxon Mobil Corporation&nbsp;</strong>XOM forecasts that global crude oil demand will remain robust, exceeding 100 million barrels per day (bpd) through 2050, per a Reuters report.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This outlook, significantly higher than <strong>BP plc</strong>&#39;s BP projection, underscores ExxonMobil&rsquo;s aggressive production strategy, distinguishing it from its European counterparts. ExxonMobil, the largest U.S. oil company, revealed its latest global oil outlook, marking a substantial increase from BP&#39;s more conservative estimates.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ExxonMobil&rsquo;s production plans are the most ambitious among Western oil giants, with the company aiming to produce 4.3 million barrels of oil and gas daily in 2024, which is 30% more than <strong>Chevron Corporation</strong>&#39;s CVX current output. In contrast, BP is on track to reduce its production to approximately 2 million bpd by 2030, aligning with its strategy to transition to lower-carbon energy sources.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the ongoing global shift toward renewable energy, ExxonMobil remains confident that the impacts of electric vehicles (EVs) on long-term oil demand will be limited. The company argues that even if every new car sold by 2035 were electric, global oil demand would still reach 85 million bpd, the same level seen in 2010. This is in stark contrast to BP&rsquo;s forecast, which suggests that oil demand will peak in 2025 and decline to 75 million bpd by 2050.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ExxonMobil&rsquo;s outlook also contrasts sharply with the International Energy Agency&rsquo;s (&ldquo;IEA&rdquo;) net-zero emission scenario, which would require a drastic reduction in crude demand to 24 million bpd by 2050. ExxonMobil projects that by mid-century, oil, natural gas and coal will still account for 67% of the global energy mix, only slightly down from 68% in 2023.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ExxonMobil&rsquo;s projections reflect a more pessimistic view of global carbon emissions reductions than BP&rsquo;s, with XOM anticipating that significant technological advancements to reduce emissions will not materialize until after 2029. This differs from BP&#39;s more optimistic timeline, which predicts reductions from the middle of this decade.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company also emphasized the need for continued investment in oil production, particularly in unconventional resources like U.S. shale. These short-cycle assets have a more rapid natural decline, with ExxonMobil estimating the global oil output to decrease 15% annually without new investments. This decline rate is notably steeper than the IEA&#39;s 2018 estimate of an 8% annual decline.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">XOM&rsquo;s analysis suggests that without sustained investment, global oil supply could shrink to 30 million bpd as early as 2030, driving oil prices up fivefold. The company highlighted the critical importance of ongoing investment in oil and gas, arguing that demand for these energy sources will continue to grow in the coming years despite the global energy transition.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As the world navigates the complex path toward cleaner energy, ExxonMobil&rsquo;s forecast underscores the continued importance of oil and gas in the global energy landscape, particularly as the population is expected to rise from 8 billion today to 10 billion by 2050.</p><h3>Zacks Rank &amp; Key Pick</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">ExxonMobil currently carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the&nbsp;energy&nbsp;sector may look at one better-ranked stock that presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

<![CDATA[ AptarGroup Hits 52-Week High: What's Driving the Stock's Performance? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 16:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>AptarGroup, Inc.</strong> ATR scaled a new 52-week high of $152.67 on Tuesday before ending the session at $150.16. The increase was fueled by ATR&rsquo;s strong second-quarter results.<br /><br />AptarGroup currently has a market capitalization of $10 billion and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s Aiding ATR&rsquo;s Price Performance?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Solid 2Q24 Results</strong></em>: ATR reported second-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $1.37, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36. The bottom line increased 12% year over year from $1.22 (including comparable exchange rates).&nbsp;<br /><br />Total revenues rose 1.6% year over year to $910 million in the reported quarter. Core sales, excluding currency and acquisition effects, improved 3% year over year. The upside was driven by the solid performance in the Pharma segment.<br /><br /><em><strong>Focus on Business Transformation</strong></em>: AptarGroup has been focused on business transformation plans to drive top-line growth, boost operational excellence, enhance its approach to innovation and improve organizational effectiveness. The company has primarily been focusing on transforming its Beauty segment, adding capabilities in Asia, implementing the latest commercial strategies, reducing costs and capitalizing on the fast-growing application fields.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s cost-control measures and pricing actions will help sustain margins in the upcoming quarters.<br />Furthermore, it improves the bottom line by capturing efficiencies and streamlining operations.<br /><br /><em><strong>Healthy Demand &amp; Growth</strong></em>: The Pharma segment is witnessing healthy demand for its proprietary dispensing devices. Demand for elastomeric components used for biologics continues to be strong.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Beauty segment is also seeing higher sales in prestige and mass fragrances, along with sales growth of skin care and color cosmetic solutions. A positive mix of pricing and volume growth will further aid the segment&rsquo;s revenues. Both beauty and closures segments are expected to witness a recovery in the North America market this year.<br /><br /><em><strong>Innovative Product Launches</strong></em>: AptarGroup is poised to gain from innovative product launches and continues to be the preferred choice for renowned brands worldwide.&nbsp;<br /><br />On Aug. 15, 2024, the firm stated that it reached a milestone with the FDA approval of neffy , a needle-free epinephrine nasal spray for the emergency treatment of severe allergic responses. Aptar Pharma&#39;s Unidose Liquid System is the approved delivery system for neffy, making it the first time when nasally-delivered epinephrine has received global regulatory approval. This will drive growth and strengthen the company&#39;s footprint in the pharmaceutical business, resulting in a high return on investment for shareholders.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">AptarGroup Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">ATR shares have gained 17.5% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 20.9%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/95/75573.jpg?v=192183113" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other top-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are <strong>Crane Company</strong> CR, <strong>Flowserve Corporation </strong>FLS and <strong>Cintas Corporation</strong> CTAS. These three companies have a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&#39;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Crane&rsquo;s 2024 earnings is pegged at $5.07 per share. The consensus estimate for 2024 earnings has moved north by 6% in the past 60 days. The company has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 11.2%. CR shares have gained 75.2% in a year.<br /><br />Flowserve has an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 18.2%.

The company&rsquo;s shares have gained 27.5% in a year.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cintas&rsquo; 2024 earnings is pegged at $16.64 per share.

<![CDATA[ Reasons to Retain Stryker Stock in Your Portfolio for Now ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stryker Corporation </strong>SYK is well-poised for growth, backed by a robust robotic arm-assisted surgery platform, Mako, and a diversified product portfolio. Meanwhile, an improvement in price also buoys optimism.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 18.4% year to date compared with the industry&rsquo;s 10.5% growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index has increased 18.2% in the same time frame.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Stryker, with a market capitalization of $134.6 billion, is one of the world&rsquo;s largest medical device companies operating in the orthopedic market. It anticipates earnings to improve 10.8% in the next five years. SYK&rsquo;s earnings yield of 3.4% compares favorably with the industry&rsquo;s 0.6%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fd/75537.jpg?v=754328584" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s Favoring Stryker&rsquo;s Growth?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company continues to witness strong performance across its segments in the United States. Strong International sales also buoy optimism. The momentum continued on the back of ongoing procedural recovery, a strong order book for capital equipment and an improvement in price last year. These positive trends are likely to continue for the rest of 2024 as well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SYK is committed to the continued expansion of Mako, with launches in new countries. It remains confident about robust growth in Mako revenues in 2024, on the back of continued adoption, new launches and software upgrades.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The second-quarter results reflect Stryker&rsquo;s efforts to promote the advanced surgery platform.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SYK also boasts a diversified product portfolio. Its wide range of products protects it against any significant sales shortfall during economic turmoil.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s significant exposure to robotics and artificial intelligence for healthcare and Medical Mechatronics has helped it stay ahead of the curve in the MedTech space. Its portfolio includes Mako, as well as products for hip and knee surgeries.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Stryker Corporation Price</h3> <img alt="Stryker Corporation Price" height="251" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/2c/1724768121.png" title="" width="599" /> <p>Stryker Corporation price | Stryker Corporation Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Per management, Stryker&rsquo;s constant support for customers and focus on innovation poise it for growth as the effect of the pandemic subsides. In the second quarter of 2024, the company&rsquo;s adjusted research and development expenses accounted for 6.7% of net sales, highlighting its strong commitment to innovation. Per management, this is likely to drive new product launches.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this month, Stryker announced the launch of its Pangea Plating System, which received FDA clearance in late 2023. Pangea System is likely to provide variable-angle plating for a range of patient demographics, and its portfolio is both extensive and adaptable.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from organic growth, Stryker is also gaining from acquisitions. The company inked two deals in August to acquire care.ai and Vertos Medical. While care.ai will add artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted virtual care workflows, smart room technology and ambient intelligence solutions, Vertos Medical will expand SYK&rsquo;s minimally invasive pain management portfolio with differentiated treatments. The company also completed the acquisition of MOLLI Surgical, a privately held company specializing in the development of wire-free soft tissue localization technology for breast-conserving surgery.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In June, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Artelon, a privately held company that specializes in innovative soft tissue fixation products for foot and ankle and sports medicine procedures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, Stryker is adopting several cost-cutting measures, including restructuring plans. The company&rsquo;s prospects in 2024 seem promising on the back of strong customer demand for its existing products as well as new launches. The adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses during the second quarter of 2024 accounted for 34% of net sales, contracting approximately 10 basis points year over year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s Hurting the Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">An unfavorable currency rate fluctuation poses a persistent threat to SYK&rsquo;s core businesses. Foreign currency had a 0.9% unfavorable impact on sales during the second quarter of 2024. The trend is likely to continue for the rest of 2024, though, at a slower pace. The company is also facing inflationary pressure, leading to lower margins.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Estimate Trend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings per share is pegged at $12.00, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.2%. In the past 30 days, the bottom-line estimate for 2024 has improved 0.4%. The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $22.37 billion, implying a 9.2% improvement year over year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are&nbsp;<strong>DaVita&nbsp;</strong>DVA,&nbsp;<strong>Aspen Technology</strong> AZPN and&nbsp;<strong>Universal Health Services</strong> UHS, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DaVita has an estimated long-term growth rate of 17.5%. DVA&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 24.2%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DaVita&rsquo;s shares have risen 43.4% year to date compared with the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 14.3% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Aspen Technology has an estimated long-term growth rate of 13.1%. AZPN&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same twice, the average surprise being 4.24%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Aspen Technology have lost 4.2% year to date against the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 13.5% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Universal Health Services has an estimated long-term growth rate of 19%. UHS&#39; earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 14.58%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s shares have risen 48.6% year to date compared with the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 39.7% growth.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327896/reasons-to-retain-stryker-stock-in-your-portfolio-for-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2327896">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ SQ Stock Price Decreases 15.2% YTD: Should Investors Hold or Fold? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 16:54:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Block, Inc. </strong>SQ shares have lost 15.2% in the year-to-date (YTD) period against the industry&rsquo;s 21.3% growth. It has also lagged the broader Zacks Business Services sector&rsquo;s 10.2% return and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 18.2% rally in the said time frame.&nbsp;<br /><br />The company has been grappling with weakening transaction activities on Cash App, and softness in consumer spending trends in food and drink, and retail discretionary verticals.<br /><br />Broader market volatility, high inflation, increased interest rates, unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations and normalization trends in the post-pandemic era have been acting as headwinds.<br /><br />Specific challenges associated with the security of payments and money transfer in the digital payments industry, and regulatory uncertainties in the cryptocurrency space are other concerns for SQ.<br /><br />Increasing pricing pressure due to rising competition from the likes of <strong>PayPal </strong>PYPL in the peer-to-peer to payments space does not bode well. SQ also faces stiff competition from <strong>Affirm </strong>AFRM in the booming buy now, pay later (BNPL) market.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Year-to-Date Price Performance</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/83/75607.jpg?v=1472020057" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Block&rsquo;s comprehensive commerce ecosystem, which enables sellers to combine software, hardware and payment services to accept payments from customers, is driving its prospects and momentum across sellers of various sizes.<br /><br />Integrations across the company&rsquo;s product lines, which deliver enhanced user experience, are driving its business growth.<br /><br />The combination of both risks and rewards is prompting investors to question whether to maintain their positions or consider selling their SQ shares.</p><h3>Portfolio Strength Drives SQ&rsquo;s Growth</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Block&rsquo;s strong positioning in the peer-to-peer payment and digital commercial transactions on the back of its robust Square ecosystem is a major positive.<br /><br />The company provides payment and point-of-sale (POS) services, which include both hardware and software, to accept payments, streamline operations and analyze business information.<br /><br />Growing momentum across the Cash App ecosystem on the back of the solid adoption of Cash App Card and Cash App Borrow is another positive.<br /><br />SQ is constantly gaining momentum in the cryptocurrency market on the back of CashApp, which allows users to buy, sell, send and receive bitcoins. The expanding global footprint of its self-custody bitcoin wallet, Bitkey, is a plus.<br /><br />It offers omnichannel solutions, which help sellers deliver enhanced customer experiences. These solutions provide customer insights by managing orders from POS and eliminating manual aggregation of online and in-person orders.<br /><br />Block&rsquo;s efforts to deliver differentiated yet better experiences to sellers on the back of artificial Intelligence (AI) integrations are noteworthy. Square Online&#39;s Themes and Square for Retail&#39;s AI-generated product descriptions help sellers enhance their customer engagement and automate sales.<br /><br />Square also offers generative AI features to sellers, enabling them to automate operations, speed up workflows and save time.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s growing momentum in the BNPL market on the back of its well-performing Afterpay division is a tailwind. Afterpay&rsquo;s strong collaboration with various brands and merchants, such as Curology, Helzberg Diamonds, Journeys, Rawlings Sporting Goods, Diane von Furstenberg, Diggs, For Eyes and Kendra Scott, to deliver an enhanced shopping experience, is noteworthy.</p><h3>Rising Estimates &amp; Attractive Valuation</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Block&rsquo;s long-term prospects are expected to benefit from compelling products and solutions, a comprehensive payment ecosystem, and a strong position in the digital payment industry.<br /><br />For 2024, the company raised its guidance for gross profit from $8.78 billion to $8.89 billion, indicating growth of 18% from the 2023 actual. The guidance for 2024 adjusted EBITDA was increased from $2.76 billion to $2.90 billion. Management also revised the guidance for operating income from $1.30 billion to $1.44 billion.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $24.52 billion, implying year-over-year growth of 11.9%.<br /><br />The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $3.58 per share, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 98.9%. The estimate has been revised 9.1% upward in the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fe/75604.jpg?v=737885947" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Block also offers an attractive valuation at current levels.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SQ is trading at a discount, with a forward 12-month P/S of 1.55X compared with the industry&rsquo;s 6.8X and lower than the median of 1.57X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/11/75605.jpg?v=1349201523" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Cash App Challenges are Concerning for Block</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">SQ has been gaining solid seller momentum across various industries, such as food, retail and services, and geographies, including the United States, Japan, Australia and Canada.&nbsp;<br /><br />The primary factor behind this remains Block&rsquo;s robust Square ecosystem, which is increasing its Gross Payment Volume (GPV). In second-quarter 2024, the company processed $61.94 billion of GPV, up 5% year over year. Square&rsquo;s GPV was $58.37 billion (94.2% of the total GPV) in the second quarter, up 8% year over year.<br /><br />Declining transaction activities on the Cash App ecosystem have been concerning. Cash App accounted for $3.57 billion of the overall GPV (5.8%), which decreased 27% year over year.<br /><br />Cash App contribution to transaction revenues was also weak. In the same quarter, Cash App contributed $99 million to transaction revenues, down 26% year over year.</p><h3>Final Take on SQ</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Block&#39;s 15.2% YTD dip presents a complex investment opportunity. While the company&#39;s strong market position, portfolio strength, rising estimates and attractive valuation metrics suggest upside, ongoing market challenges and declining Cash App transaction activities cannot be ignored.&nbsp;<br /><br />Investors should carefully weigh these factors against their risk tolerance and long-term investment goals before making a decision. While it may be premature to abandon the stock for those who have already invested in it, new investors should wait for a better entry point.<br /><br />Block currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ <p>After experiencing a downward trend since this year&#39;s start, <strong>NIKE Inc.</strong> NKE shares have recently bounced back, with a 14.6% rise in the past month. This rebound has resulted in the Beaverton, OR-based company outperforming its industry peers, the broader sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index.<br /><br />NIKE&rsquo;s share price increase of 14.6% outpaced the industry&#39;s 12.8% growth in the past month. It also exceeded the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s respective increases of 2.5% and 2.9% in the same period.<br /><br />Additionally, NIKE&#39;s performance is notably stronger than its close competitor, <strong>lululemon athletica inc. </strong>LULU, which posted a 4.9% gain in a month. NKE surpassed other industry peers, including <strong>Adidas</strong>&rsquo; ADDYY 4.6% decline and <strong>Skechers</strong>&rsquo; SKX 8.1% growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/87/75561.jpg?v=534399985" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Currently trading at $84.28, the stock rebounded 19% from its 52-week low of $70.75 attained on Aug 5. However, NKE is trading 31.7% below its 52-week high of $123.39.<br /><br />The recent rebound marks a clear recovery from NIKE&#39;s otherwise lackluster performance in recent months. Let us discuss whether the stock&rsquo;s bounce back is driven by the company&#39;s underlying fundamentals, specific developments, or a recovery in the broader market. However, the question remains whether the stock&#39;s recovery from its recent 52-week low is sustainable.</p><h2>Is This Momentum Sustainable Amid Challenges Facing NIKE?</h2><p><br />Although the NKE stock has shown signs of recovery, the recent challenges facing NIKE&#39;s operations cannot be overlooked. The company has struggled with weakness in its lifestyle business, which includes men&#39;s, women&#39;s and Jordan lines, particularly in the Digital channel. In the fiscal fourth quarter, NIKE Digital sales dropped 10% year over year, impacted by weaker traffic, increased promotions and reduced sales of certain classic footwear franchises.<br /><br />The ongoing rise in inflation and higher interest rates are impacting consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items, making consumers more selective with their purchases. This has been a major challenge for luxury retail brands, especially in North America. These soft sales trends in lifestyle products overshadowed the improvement in NIKE&#39;s performance products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.<br /><br />Additionally, recent trends indicate significant shifts in consumer traffic in Greater China, a key market for NIKE&#39;s global strategy. Notably, brick-and-mortar traffic in the region declined year over year in the double digits in the fiscal fourth quarter. Due to continued traffic softness across all marketplace channels, revenues in Greater China&rsquo;s NIKE Direct channel fell 2%, including a 6% decline in NIKE stores, offset by an 8% rise in NIKE Digital.<br /><br />Management has highlighted that the China marketplace remains highly promotional, leading to careful management of both NIKE and partner inventory. While the near-term outlook for the region has softened, management remains confident in NIKE&#39;s long-term competitive position in China.<br /><br />Management has revised its outlook for fiscal 2025, citing challenges related to lifestyle product sales, macroeconomic headwinds in Greater China, certain EMEA and other markets, soft digital sales trends, and unfavorable currency rates.<br /><br />The company noted that managing a product cycle transition and shifting channel mix dynamics is complex and may take time to scale. Management&#39;s fiscal 2025 outlook is based on adjusting timelines and pacing to manage the marketplace supply of its classic footwear franchises, which is expected to weigh on near-term performance.<br /><br />As a result, NIKE projects fiscal 2025 reported revenues to decline in the mid-single digits, with first-half revenues moving down in the high-single digits. The company noted that foreign exchange headwinds have worsened, likely leading to a one-point translational impact on revenues in fiscal 2025.<br /><br />Additionally, management anticipates lower NIKE Digital growth, especially in the first half of fiscal 2025, due to decreased traffic from fewer launches, planned reductions in classic footwear franchises, lesser promotional activity, and increased macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in Greater China, with uneven consumer trends continuing in EMEA and other global markets. The company also expects to sell more to wholesale partners as it balances product innovation and newness across the marketplace and finalizes the second-half order books.<br /><br />For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, NIKE expects revenues to decline 10% year over year, led by more aggressive actions in managing its classic footwear franchises, ongoing challenges in NIKE Digital, muted wholesale order books, a weaker outlook for Greater China and several quarter-specific timing factors.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s bleak fiscal first-quarter outlook indicates that the ongoing operational issues and macroeconomic conditions in China and other parts are far from recovery in the near term. While the company continues to retain its position as the leader in the athletic apparel and shoes industry with its underlying strengths, its financial recovery should take time.</p><h2>Is a Premium Valuation Good for NKE?</h2><p><br />Despite the stock&rsquo;s lackluster year-to-date performance, NIKE is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 26.2X, exceeding the industry average of 23.15X and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s average of 21.72X. The current valuation is also above its five-year median level of 30.55X.<br /><br />Though trading much below its five-year high of 48.27X, the current valuation may still be considered expensive, given the significant downside risks if the company&#39;s ongoing perils are not resolved for a prolonged period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/83/75562.jpg?v=1198234738" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The consumer discretionary market is becoming increasingly competitive. Additionally, doubts regarding the success of NKE&rsquo;s innovation strategy, and inventory management efforts in the current scenario make the stock less attractive. Macroeconomic headwinds and increased competition could hinder NKE&rsquo;s ability to maintain its recent growth trajectory.<br /><br />Moreover, NKE is trading below its 50-day moving average, indicating a bearish outlook and challenges in sustaining the recent performance levels.</p><h2>NIKE&rsquo;s Stock Trades Below 50-Day Moving Average</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/07/75572.jpg?v=1521080674" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>How to Play NIKE?</h2><p>Despite all the hassle, NKE remains a market leader in the athletic goods industry, with a market cap of $126.5 billion, more than two times of the second-leading industry player Adidas&rsquo;s $43.7 billion market cap. While NIKE&#39;s robust innovation pipeline, strategic initiatives and efficient inventory management may drive revenue growth in the long term, its near-term challenges in lifestyle products and Greater China cannot be ignored.<br /><br />Additionally, NKE&rsquo;s premium valuation relative to industry peers raises concerns about sustainability, especially amid the ongoing operational challenges, macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable FX. Investors should consider these factors carefully and evaluate their risk tolerance.<br /><br />Current shareholders may consider locking in gains, whereas new investors should exercise caution before approaching this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock.<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327895/nike-nke-stock-jumps-15-in-a-month-should-you-buy-hold-or-sell?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2327895">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>UiPath, Inc.</strong> PATH shares have declined 45.9% in the past six months against the 6.9% rally of the industry it belongs to and the 12.1% rise in Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Six-Months Price Performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6f/75593.jpg?v=692325691" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Compared with other close competitors, PATH&rsquo;s performance falls short. <strong>Oracle Corporation </strong>ORCL has risen 25.1% and <strong>SAP SE </strong>SAP has gained 16.7% over the same period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Looking at the recent performance, PATH has gained 2.6% over the past month, suggesting that there might be a reversal or a halt in the correction phase. The stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, an indication of bullish sentiment among investors.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">50-Day Moving Average</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/50/75594.jpg?v=322971223" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the recent correction in UiPath&rsquo;s shares, investors might be tempted to buy the stock. But is this the right time to buy?</p><h2>Tech Innovation Leads to PATH&rsquo;s Success</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">PATH has been adding several features to the platform. For instance, it is capable of performing processing mining and task log analysis to recognize manual processes. Autopilot can suggest the next steps for workflows, introducing an element of gen-AI to the platform. AI&rsquo;s ability to observe and understand screens is a tactful addition to conventional screen scraping that is creating pathways for less-technical users to also create automation. Also, it opens the door to multi-screen and app ecosystems, like banking applications, which are fragmented and could gain from this.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Tech giants such as Microsoft have considered UiPath as their vendor of preference for automation. They co-operate and compete on several occasions. However, they have been able to assist each other. For instance, PATH utilizes Azure, which heightens cloud usage for Microsoft. The company has referred to UiPath as its automation enterprise partner.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company is developing other products that will scale well in the future. Its commitment to rapid technology innovation, strategic partnerships and focus on the expansion of product position PATH well for success.</p><h2>UiPath&rsquo;s Customer-Centric Growth Looks Promising</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">UiPath ended the first quarter of fiscal 2025 with 10,800 customers, declining from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s 10,850 customers. The decline in this number is due to attrition in smaller customers that represent an immaterial portion of the company&rsquo;s overall business.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite this marginal decline, customers with $100,000 or more in annual recurring revenues (ARR) increased to 2,092 from 1,860 in the year-ago quarter. Customers with $1 million or more in ARR amounted to 288 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, increasing 20% from the year-ago quarter. PATH&rsquo;s largest customers are also continuing to expand on its platform. The company added a record number of customers with $5 million or more in ARR.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">UiPath&rsquo;s dollar-based gross retention of 98% continues to be the best in class and its dollar-based net retention rate for first-quarter fiscal 2025 was 118%. The versatility of platform capabilities continues to drive customer base expansion for PATH, including Red Bull, which began with core automation and expanded in the quarter by purchasing Test Suite and Document Understanding. It plans to utilize Test Suite to propel its S/4 HANA migration while using Document Understanding to automate numerous use cases across its Finance, Operations and HR departments. In addition to that, Etihad Airways plans to leverage PATH&rsquo;s platform to support and build more AI automation across commercial and operational functions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, UiPath&rsquo;s financial performance remains strong, driven by its customer base. It focuses on high-ARR-generating customers to demonstrate its ability to sustain growth and maintain a strong market position.</p><h2>Robust Liquidity Position Benefits PATH</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">UiPath&rsquo;s liquidity remains healthy, with a current ratio of 4.13 at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, rising from the preceding quarter&rsquo;s 3.63. This compares with the industry average of 1.02. PATH&rsquo;s strong liquidity position provides it with financial flexibility and helps it with efficient mitigation of credit risks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ab/75595.jpg?v=2011450174" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">UiPath&rsquo;s Trimmed Revenues Projection Disappoints</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reduced its revenue forecast and predicts second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues between $300 million and $305 million, with a breakeven non-GAAP operating income. The company also trimmed the fiscal 2025 revenue projection to $1.405-$1.410 billion and anticipates a non-GAAP operating income of $145 million. We believe that the recent decrease in PATH&rsquo;s stock price is due to a lowered revenue outlook as it can erode investor confidence.</p><h2>PATH to See Strong Sales, Weak Earnings in FY25</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UiPath&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $1.4 billion, implying 7.6% year-over-year growth. Sales are anticipated to retain the upward momentum, with 11.7% year-over-year growth in fiscal 2026.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, despite the strong revenue growth prospects, the company&rsquo;s bottom line appears gloomy. The consensus estimate for UiPath&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings stands at 38 cents per share, which represents a 29.6% year-over-year decline. On the brighter side, earnings in fiscal 2026 are estimated to gain 11.8% year over year.</p><h2>Wait for the Right Moment to Invest in UiPath</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The probable reversal in the stock performance does not signal the end of a correction phase. Waiting for a more advantageous entry point could yield better returns for investors. UiPath&#39;s rapid technological innovation, customer-driven growth, strength in liquidity position, and positive top-line prospects make it a compelling investment in the long term. However, potential investors should remain patient and watch for further adjustments in the stock price before making their move.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PATH carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327893/uipath-stock-price-decreases-46-in-6-months-is-it-worth-buying?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2327893">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Constellation Energy Shares Gain 86.4% in a Year: Should You Buy? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <strong>Constellation Energy Corporation</strong> CEG have rallied 86.4% over the past year compared with its industry&rsquo;s growth of 28.7%. CEG continues to add clean energy to the grid through its efficient operation of nuclear plants and extending the lives of existing plants through new licenses.<br /><br />The solid year-to-date performance of Constellation Energy allowed it to increase its guidance for 2024 earnings per share.<br /><br />The CEG stock has also outperformed its sector and the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One-Year Price Performance</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/47/75602.jpg?v=1688388964" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A pertinent question might appear in investors&#39; minds, whether the stock can move higher from the current level or has reached the top. Let us delve deeper into the fundamental aspects of the company and throw some light in that direction.</p><h2>Factors Acting as Tailwinds for CEG Stock</h2><p>Constellation Energy&rsquo;s sustainable business strategy is responding to the climate crisis caused by the emissions generated from power production and delivering long-term value for customers, employees and shareholders. CEG&rsquo;s highly efficient nuclear fleet continues to create huge volumes of clean electricity to meet customers&rsquo; requirements.<br /><br />The capacity factor of the majority of the nuclear power plants owned by Constellation Energy is showing an improvement, which makes them more reliable than other renewable sources of energy like wind and solar. CEG-owned nuclear power plants had a 95.4% capacity factor for the second quarter of 2024 compared with 92.4% for the second quarter of 2023, reflecting increased clean power production.<br /><br />Constellation Energy is also benefiting from artificial intelligence (AI) and data center-driven clean power demand. Per a Business Insider report, major tech companies are going to invest nearly $1 trillion in data centers in the next five years. AI-driven data centers require more electricity than traditional data center racks. CEG can gain from rising clean energy demand from data centers, with its ability to generate in excess of 45 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy and its increasing capacity.</p><h2>Constellation Energy Raises Shareholder Value</h2><p>Constellation Energy continues to make share repurchases and has repurchased shares worth $1 billion year to date and has $1 billion remaining under its share repurchase program. The company has more than $2.3 billion of capital left to be allocated for 2024 and 2025.<br /><br />Constellation Energy pays a quarterly dividend to its shareholders. The company aims to increase its dividend by 10% annually, subject to its board&#39;s approval. Check CEG&rsquo;s dividend history here.</p><h2>CEG&rsquo;s ROA Higher Than Its Industry</h2><p>CEG&rsquo;s trailing 12-month return on assets (ROA) is 3.56%, ahead of the industry average of 3.51%. ROA is a financial ratio that measures how well a company uses its assets to generate profit. The current ROA of the company indicates that it is using its assets more efficiently than its peers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c7/75603.jpg?v=742586496" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><br />Constellation Energy&rsquo;s Earnings Estimates Move Up</h2><p>Courtesy of its strong year-to-date performance, Constellation Energy has raised its 2024 earnings per share guidance to $7.60-$8.40 from the prior mentioned $7.23-$8.03. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CEG&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings per share moved up 4.4% and 2.5%, respectively, in the last 60 days. The upward revisions in earnings estimates indicate analysts&rsquo; increasing confidence in the stock.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 and 2025 earnings per share of its peer <strong>NRG Energy</strong> NRG moved down 9.5% and 10.5%, respectively, in the last 60 days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/05/75608.jpg?v=463124503" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>CEG Stock Trades at a Premium<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>The company is currently trading at a premium compared with its industry on a forward 12-month P/E basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/bd/75609.jpg?v=1095554949" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Summing Up</h2><p>Constellation Energy is benefiting from the increasing demand for clean energy in its service territories, driven by the development of AI-driven data centers. CEG&rsquo;s strong production capacity will allow it to meet the rising demand.<br /><br />It is better to remain invested in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock and enjoy the benefits of dividends, share buybacks and rising earnings estimates.<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327891/constellation-energy-shares-gain-86-4-in-a-year-should-you-buy?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2327891">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Here is Why Growth Investors Should Buy New York Times (NYT) Now ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 16:45:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.</p><p>In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.</p><p>However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.</p><p>New York Times Co. (NYT) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.</p><p>Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.</p><p>While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this newspaper publisher is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:</p><p><h2>Earnings Growth</h2></p><p>Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.</p><p>While the historical EPS growth rate for New York Times is 16.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 16.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -53.9%.</p><p><h2>Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio</h2></p><p>Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.</p><p>Right now, New York Times has an S/TA ratio of 0.94, which means that the company gets $0.94 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.92, it can be said that the company is more efficient.</p><p>While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And New York Times is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 6.3% this year versus the industry average of 0%.</p><p><h2>Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions</h2></p><p>Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for New York Times.

<![CDATA[ 5 Bank Stocks to Watch Out for as They Hit a New 52-Week High ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 16:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The finance sector is showcasing its resilience, with several banking stocks touching a new 52-week high. It signifies positive momentum and suggests that the price has been steadily growing over the last 52 weeks. This might attract more investors and traders who regard the stock as a great performer and want to ride the current rising trend.<br /><br />To narrow down the list, we have selected stocks with a market capitalization of $5 billion and above.&nbsp; Investors can keep a close watch on stocks like <strong>UMB Financial Corporation</strong> UMBF, <strong>Glacier Bancorp, Inc</strong>. GBCI, <strong>Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc</strong>. PNFP, <strong>Western Alliance Bancorporation</strong> WAL and <strong>Regions Financial Corporation</strong> RF, as they are expected to maintain their momentum and keep scaling new highs.&nbsp;<br /><br />Stocks that reach new 52-week highs are generally prone to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals. Given their high price, investors frequently ask if it is overvalued. While the speculation is not completely unfounded, not all companies that reach a 52-week high are expensive.<br /><br />To avoid the high pricing, investors may miss out on stocks with strong fundamentals.<br /><br />The above-mentioned bank stocks outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the Finance sector over the past six months.<br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ce/75598.jpg?v=474701996" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">To determine whether a stock has room for more upside, let&rsquo;s delve deeper.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Leading to Stocks Hitting New 52-Week High</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Before discussing the banks mentioned above, let&rsquo;s discuss the factors driving these banks to scale at a new high.<br /><br />A major driving factor for this upward movement of banking stocks can be attributable to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell&#39;s statement the central bank is ready to cut interest rates next month. Jerome Powell, at the Kansas City Fed&#39;s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole on Monday, said, &ldquo;The time has come for policy to adjust.&rdquo;<br /><br />While the timing and pace of these rate cuts will &quot;depend on incoming data,&quot; market participants were quick to signal four rate cuts of 25 basis points each by 2024-end. Powell stated that the central bank has &quot;ample room&quot; to maneuver as monetary policy enters its next phase without a high recession risk.&nbsp;<br /><br />With the rate cut, the bank&rsquo;s NII is expected to benefit as funding costs will stabilize. This is a positive development for banking stocks reeling under high fund costs. Such positive indicators reinforced investors&#39; confidence in the banking sector and contributed to stocks touching a two-year high.&nbsp;<br /><br />Banks are also making efforts to diversify their revenue streams to reduce dependency on spread income. Over the past few years, these companies have been actively acquiring or forming strategic partnerships to strengthen non-interest income. Also, the banks are active in increasing their footprint by expanding into unexplored yet high-growth markets.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Watch as They Reach New 52-Week High</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>UMB Financial</strong>: Headquartered in Kansas City, MO, UMB Financial has been diversifying operations to non-interest sources to reduce exposure to spread income. Its investment in revenue-producing capabilities is likely to support top-line growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Further, UMBF is expected to benefit from a low-interest rate environment. The company&rsquo;s NII witnessed a CAGR of 8.2% over the last four years (ended 2023), with the uptrend continuing in the first half of 2024. With the Federal Reserve indicating a rate cut beginning September 2024, the company&rsquo;s NII is likely to benefit as funding costs will stabilize.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UMBF&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has been revised upward to $8.54 per share in the past 30 days.&nbsp;<br /><br />UMB Financial crafted a 52-week high, touching $105.72 before closing the session at $102.66 on Monday. UMBF currently has a market capitalization of $5 billion.<br /><br /><strong>Glacier Bancorp</strong>: Headquartered in Kalispell, MT, GBCI provides a wide range of banking products and services with total assets of $27.8 billion as of June 30, 2024. In July 2024, GBCI acquired Community Financial Group, Inc., the bank-holding subsidiary of Wheatland Bank. This transaction enhances GBCI &lsquo;s existing market presence and will likely benefit its financials in the long run.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GBCI&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has remained steady at $1.62 per share in the past seven days.<br />&nbsp;<br />GBCI touched a 52-week high of $47.71 before closing the session at $46.58 on Monday. At present, GBCI has a market capitalization of $5.28 billion.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Pinnacle Financial Partners</strong>: The company offering a diverse range of banking, investment, trust, mortgage, and insurance products and services expanded its footprint into North Florida with the addition of five veteran financial services professionals in January. This will allow the bank to dwell in high-growth markets and reap the benefits of it.<br /><br />Also, the bank has been focusing on several strategic initiatives with the objective of capital optimization and balance sheet repositioning. Management anticipates to witness 8-10% growth in its NII in 2024 from $317 million in 2023.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PNFP&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has moved 1.3% north at $6.83 per share in the past 60 days.<br /><br />PNFP reached a 52-week high, touching $99.84 before closing the session at $97.66 on Monday. PNFP holds a market capitalization of $7.54 billion.<br /><br /><strong>Western Alliance Bancorporation</strong>: One of the leading banking companies in the United States is benefitting from solid NII growth and increasing loan and deposit balances. Management expects NII to increase 9%-14% in 2024 from $2.3 billion reported in 2023.&nbsp;<br /><br />WAL&rsquo;s primary subsidiary, Western Alliance Bank, acquired Digital Settlement Technologies, DBA Digital Disbursements, the leading digital payments platform for the class action legal industry, in January 2022. Through this transaction, Western Alliance Bank enabled the seamless integration of a customizable pay menu into settlement claim forms and other payment selection websites.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAL&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has revised marginally upward to $7.40 per share in a month.&nbsp;<br /><br />WAL touched a 52-week high of $83.23 before closing the session at $80.90 on Monday. WAL holds a market capitalization of $8.91 billion.<br /><br /><strong>Regions Financial</strong>: Birmingham, AL-based financial holding company continues to benefit from expanding and diversifying its business operations on the back of investments in varied product offerings and through inorganic expansion efforts. The company acquired Clearsight, Sabal Capital, and EnerBank USA, which diversified its revenue sources.<br /><br />Improvement in loan balances, combined with the Federal Reserve&#39;s indication of a potential rate cut beginning September 2024, is expected to stabilize funding costs and drive NII growth. With a solid foundation and strategic market presence, the company is well-poised for sustained growth in the long run.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RF&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has moved upward by 1% at $2 per share in the past 60 days.&nbsp;<br /><br />RF touched a 52-week high of $23.09 before closing the session at $22.79 on Monday. RF currently has a market capitalization of $20.86 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The five bank stocks &mdash; UMBF, GBCI, PNFP, WAL, and RF &mdash; have decent growth prospects for the near future. They might have room left to run even higher. Thus, investors must keep these stocks on their radar and wait for an attractive entry point.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327870/5-bank-stocks-to-watch-out-for-as-they-hit-a-new-52-week-high?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|investment_ideas-2327870">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Should You Buy Marsh & McLennan Stock Now to Minimize Risk? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. </strong>MMC is one of the major insurance brokers with a diversified set of businesses and an expanding geographical footprint. With a market cap of $109.8 billion, the company&rsquo;s strong international operations and growing Risk and Insurance Services segment are major tailwinds.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors can go with this insurance giant to reduce risk in their portfolios. Shares of Marsh &amp; McLennan have jumped 18.4% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 Index&rsquo;s 17.8% growth. It has the ingredients for further price appreciation.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/79/75576.jpg?v=1231407266" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MMC Mitigating Risks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company generates most of its revenues from developed and western markets, limiting geographic risks. This is beneficial against growing geopolitical volatilities. Also, it has expanding operations in emerging markets like Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions, which positions it for long-term growth. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MMC typically maintains long-term relationships with its clients because the company has a deep understanding of their risk exposure and experience in securing their assets. This makes it difficult and risky for clients to switch brokers. The strong customer loyalty and high switching costs are further reinforced by MMC&#39;s unmatched global presence and industry insights, which large businesses &mdash; MMC&#39;s primary clients &mdash; value more than what smaller competitors can offer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With a beta of 0.94, Marsh &amp; McLennan&rsquo;s stock is less volatile than the market. The company&#39;s consulting business plays a crucial role in retaining clients and attracting new ones through upselling, setting it apart from competitors who lack the same level of experience and scale. Additionally, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company&rsquo;s ability to generate proprietary data gives it a significant edge over the competition. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Marsh &amp; McLennan&#39;s stable operations, diverse product offerings and advancements in digital capabilities are expected to drive profit growth while maintaining a transparent trajectory. Its growing strength in the Marsh unit, especially in the United States/Canada market, will continue to boost the bottom line, as evident from the recent estimate revisions trend. Let&#39;s take a closer look at the estimates for MMC in 2024 and 2025.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">MMC Estimate Revisions Trend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate MMC&rsquo;s 2024 bottom line is pegged at $8.74 per share, indicating 9.4% year-over-year growth. It has witnessed two upward estimate revisions in the past month against no movement in the opposite direction. The consensus estimate for 2025 earnings signals an 8% further gain. The company has managed to beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters with an average surprise of 5.8%. Also, the consensus mark for 2024 and 2025 revenues indicates 6.7% and 5.7% year-over-year increases, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/76/75578.jpg?v=723749937" style="width: 600px; height: 310px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the broader&nbsp;Finance space may look at some other top-ranked players like <strong>Aflac Incorporated </strong>AFL, <strong>Brown &amp; Brown, Inc. </strong>BRO and&nbsp;<strong>Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. </strong>AJG, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aflac&rsquo;s current-year earnings is pegged at $6.73 per share, which indicates 8% year-over-year growth. It witnessed seven upward estimate revisions in the past 30 days against no downward movements. AFL beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters and missed once, with an average surprise of 8.2%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Brown &amp; Brown&rsquo;s 2024 earnings indicates 31% year-over-year growth. During the past two months, BRO has witnessed six upward estimate revisions against none in the opposite direction. It beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 9.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Arthur J. Gallagher&rsquo;s current-year earnings suggests a 16% year-over-year jump. During the past two months, AJG has witnessed six upward estimate revisions against none in the opposite direction. The consensus mark for current-year revenues indicates 14.5% growth from a year ago.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327867/should-you-buy-marsh-mclennan-stock-now-to-minimize-risk?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2327867">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Visa Inc. </strong>V has recently launched a new service called the Money Movement Advisory Practice in the United States and Canada. This service, offered by its Visa Consulting &amp; Analytics arm, aims to help businesses and partners navigate the complex world of digital payments, which includes various ways to transfer money across different platforms and channels.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The service is a response to the growing demand for quick and easy payment solutions. Its Money Movement solutions, like Visa Direct, enable real-time and secure transactions around the world, allowing clients to reach almost 8.5 billion endpoints in many countries and currencies. This creates opportunities in a market estimated to be worth $200 trillion globally, per the payment juggernaut.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Its new practice will help the clients define strategies and improve user experiences related to money movement, making it easier and faster to integrate Visa&#39;s payment solutions into their systems.

<![CDATA[ Jacobs' Halcrow Signs Consultancy Deal With CEDD in Hong Kong ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 16:31:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The joint venture (JV) between <strong>Jacobs Solutions Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s J subsidiary, Halcrow, and <strong>AECOM</strong> ACM has entered into a consultancy agreement with the Civil Engineering and Development Department (&ldquo;CEDD&rdquo;) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (&ldquo;HKSAR&rdquo;) government. The agreement underlines the associated work for the first phase of the San Tin Technopole in Hong Kong.<br /><br />The contract for the first phase includes 250-hectare land development for the city within the Northern Metropolis to support innovation and technology development, housing, community and commercial facilities. Moreover, the project will adopt an integrated low-carbon infrastructure system to meet carbon neutrality goals before 2050 and employ digital strategies, including building information modeling and digital twins, to improve project outcomes.<br /><br />The work scope of the JV includes design review, detailed design, tendering, construction supervision and associated engineering infrastructure works of San Tin Technopole.<br /><br />San Tin Technopole development will be carried out in two phases, with the first population and business intake expected in 2031. Upon completion, it is expected to offer approximately 54,000 new housing units.</p><h2>Increasing Backlog Driving J&rsquo;s Growth</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Jacobs&rsquo; efficient project execution has increased the demand for its consulting services in various sectors, including infrastructure, water, environment, space, broadband, cybersecurity and life sciences. The strong performance in the recent quarters is reflected through its ongoing contract.<br /><br />The aforementioned statement is supported by the company&rsquo;s ongoing backlog growth. At the fiscal third-quarter end, it reported a backlog of $30.6 billion, up from $28.9 billion in the year-ago period. This reflects persistent solid demand for Jacobs&#39; consulting services. Of this backlog, P&amp;PS backlog was $19.28 billion compared with $17.5 billion in the comparable year-ago period, primarily driven by growth in the Life Sciences and Energy markets.<br /><br />Furthermore, the Critical Mission Solutions&rsquo; backlog at the end of the fiscal third quarter was $8.45 billion, up year over year from $8.1 billion, providing strong visibility into the base business. The upside was mainly fueled by expansion and higher funding in the U.K. and U.S. nuclear remediation markets, along with growth in the U.K. defense sector.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/48/75592.jpg?v=987278344" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of this professional, technical and construction services provider have gained 9.1% in the past three months, outperforming the Zacks Technology Services industry&rsquo;s 4.6% growth. The company is expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments.</p><h2>Zacks Rank</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Jacobs currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>About AECOM</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AECOM is a leading solutions provider for supporting professional, technical and management solutions for diverse industries across end markets like transportation, facilities and government, as well as those in environmental, energy and water businesses. It specializes in providing integrated services for planning, construction and maintenance of infrastructures that include consulting, architecture and engineering, as well as managing the requirements for energy, water and environment of various private and public clients.<br /><br />ACM recently posted decent third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On a year-over-year basis, the top and bottom line increased, backed by solid organic growth in net service revenues in its reportable segments.</p><h2>Recent Peer Releases</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>KBR, Inc.</strong> KBR reported mixed second-quarter 2024 results, with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. The top and the bottom line increased on a year-over-year basis.<br /><br />The upside was predominantly driven by expansion in Sustainable Technology Solutions and notable advancements within Government Solutions. The International, Defense &amp; Intel and Science and Space sectors witnessed new contracts and on-contract growth. Driven by robust performance in its core business, KBR raised its adjusted EBITDA and cash flow guidance for 2024.<br /><br /><strong>Quanta Services Inc.</strong> PWR reported mixed results for second-quarter 2024, wherein adjusted earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but revenues surpassed the same. Both metrics increased on a year-over-year basis.<br /><br />The growth was supported by robust demand for its services, propelled by customers&#39; multi-year initiatives aimed at modernizing and fortifying utility infrastructure, expanding renewable energy generation and transmission infrastructure, and transitioning toward a low-carbon economy. Moreover, the company has raised its 2024 guidance for major metrics, owing to the expected contributions from its recent acquisition of CEI.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327885/jacobs-halcrow-signs-consultancy-deal-with-cedd-in-hong-kong?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_corporate_actions-2327885">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ BHP Group FY24 Earnings & Revenues Improve Y/Y on Higher Prices ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BHP Group</strong> BHP reported a 2% year-over-year increase in underlying attributable profit from continuing operations at $13.7 billion for fiscal 2024 (ended June 30, 2024).&nbsp; The growth was attributed to higher prices and sales volumes in BHP&rsquo;s iron ore and copper operations, productivity initiatives, cost discipline and favorable raw material costs. This offset the impact of lower energy coal and nickel prices and higher labor costs on profits.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s underlying earnings per share were $2.70 compared with $2.65 in fiscal 2023. Earnings per American Depositary Share (ADS) were $5.39s, higher than $5.30 in the previous fiscal year. The metric missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.52. BHP&rsquo;s each ADS represents two fully-paid ordinary shares.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s FY24 Revenues Up 3%</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenues for fiscal 2024 totaled $55.7 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $54 billion. The top line was 3.4% higher than the prior fiscal year. The improvement was due to higher prices and sales volumes for iron ore and copper compared with the prior fiscal.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was offset by lower energy coal and nickel prices, and lower steelmaking coal volumes following the divestment of Blackwater and Daunia on April 2, 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Iron ore segment&rsquo;s revenues rose 13% year over year to around $28 billion and revenues in the Copper segment increased 16% to $18.6 billion. Both segments benefited from higher volumes and prices. The Coal segment&rsquo;s revenues plunged 30% to $7.7 billion.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BHP Delivers Solid Production Numbers for Iron &amp; Copper</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s total iron ore production for fiscal 2024 was a record 260 Mt, up 1% year over year. Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO)&nbsp; delivered a record iron ore production of 255 Mt (287 Mt on a 100% basis). This reflects solid supply-chain performance with increased capacity unlocked by the record production at South Flank. These gains helped offset the impacts of the continued tie-in activity for the Rail Technology Program 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Copper production rose 9% year over year to 1,865 kt, the highest in 15 years. Nickel production was up 2% to 81.6 kt</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BHP Witnesses 4% Rise in EBITDA</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased 4% from the prior fiscal to $29 billion. Higher revenues and lower diesel and acid prices were offset by higher labor costs. Productivity initiatives and BHP&rsquo;s efforts to control costs offset higher labor costs. The underlying EBITDA margin was 54%, flat with the prior fiscal. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For the Iron ore segment, underlying EBITDA was up 13% year on year to $18.9 billion while the Copper segment&rsquo;s underlying EBITDA increased 29% to $8.6 billion. The Coal segment&rsquo;s underlying EBITDA plunged 54% year over year to $2.3 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Profit from operations (including exceptional items of $6.1 billion) declined 24% year over year to $17.5 billion.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In fiscal 2024, BHP&rsquo;s attributable profit (for total operations) declined 39% year over year to $7.9 billion, which included an exceptional loss of $5.8 billion. The figure of $5.8 billion includes a $2.7 billion impairment of Western Australia Nickel and a $3.8 billion charge related to the Samarco dam failure, offset by a gain of $0.7 billion on disposal of the Blackwater and Daunia mines.</p><h2>BHP&rsquo;s Cash Flow Improves, Debt Down</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Net operating cash flow for fiscal 2024 was $20.7 billion compared with $18.7 billion in fiscal 2023. The improvement was attributed to lower tax and royalty-related taxation finalization payments compared with the prior fiscal. BHP Group reported a free cash flow of $11.9 billion, a significant improvement from $5.6 billion in fiscal 2023.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company invested $9.3 billion in line with its Capital Allocation Framework. This included $5.9 billion in organic development and $3 billion in maintenance and decarbonization.<br />&nbsp;<br />BHP&rsquo;s cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2024, amounted to $12.5 billion compared with $12.4 billion as of June 30, 2023. Capital and exploration expenditures totaled $9.3 billion, up 31% from the prior fiscal year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Backed by its solid cash flow, BHP continued to repay debt and as of the end of fiscal 2024, net debt was $9.1 billion compared with $11.2 billion as of fiscal 2023 end.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BHP has budgeted capital and exploration expenditures in fiscal 2024 and 2025 to be $10 billion and $11 billion, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s board has announced a dividend of 74 cents per share or a total of $3.8 billion. This translates to a payout ratio of 53%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s Production &amp; Unit Cost Guidance for FY25</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">BHP&rsquo;s iron ore production guidance for fiscal 2025 is in the range of 255-265.5 Mt. WAIO&#39;s production is expected to be between 250 Mt and 260 Mt (282 Mt and 294 Mt on a 100% basis).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company expects copper production to be within the range of 1,845-2,045 kt. Production guidance for metallurgical coal is in the band of 16.5-19 Mt while the guidance for energy coal is in the range of 13-15 Mt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Unit cost guidance for WAIO is in the range of $18.00-$19.50 per ton. Escondida unit cost is estimated to be in the band of $1.30-$1.60 per pound. Spence unit costs are expected to be between $2.00 and $2.30 per pound. Copper South Australia&rsquo;s unit cost is anticipated to be between $1.30 and $1.80 per pound. BMA unit cost is expected to be between $112 and $124 per ton.</p><h2>BHP Stock&rsquo;s Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">BHP Group&rsquo;s shares have fallen 18.4% year to date compared with the industry&rsquo;s 10.1% decline.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b5/75580.jpg?v=1860463378" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>BHP&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Other Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">BHP Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).<br />&nbsp;<br />Some other top-ranked stocks from the basic materials space are <strong>Carpenter Technology Corporation</strong> CRS, <strong>IAMGOLD Corporation</strong> IAG and <strong>Eldorado Gold Corporation</strong> EGO. CRS, IAG and EGO sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Carpenter Technology&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings is pegged at $6.06 per share.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nordson Corporation</strong> NDSN is well-poised for growth, courtesy of strength across its businesses and accretive acquisitions. Handsome rewards to shareholders add to the stock&rsquo;s appeal.<br /><br />Headquartered in Westlake, OH, Nordson is one of the leading manufacturers as well as distributors of products and systems designed to dispense, apply and control adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials and other fluids. The company&#39;s product line includes single-use components, stand-alone units for low-volume operations and microprocessor-based automated systems for high-speed, high-volume production lines.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s delve into the factors that make this company a smart investment choice at the moment.<br /><br /><strong>Business Strength:</strong> Strong momentum in the Industrial Precision Solutions segment is supporting Nordson&rsquo;s performance. Growing demand for nonwoven product lines in the industrial and consumer non-durable end markets is aiding the segment. Also, the growing need for packaged goods in food and beverage, personal care and cosmetics markets is driving demand for the company&#39;s packaging product lines, which also bodes well for the segment.<br /><br /><strong>Expansion Efforts:</strong> NDSN is focused on strengthening its competency through acquisitions. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended July 2024), acquired assets boosted the company&rsquo;s total revenues by 4%. In August 2024, Nordson completed the acquisition of Atrion Corporation. The inclusion of Atrion&rsquo;s three major businesses &mdash; Halkey Roberts, Atrion Medical and Quest Medical &mdash; will enable Nordson to expand its medical offerings in the infusion and cardiovascular therapies market. Management expects the buyout to offer significant operational synergies when combined with its medical business expertise.&nbsp;<br /><br />In August 2023, the company acquired ARAG Group and its subsidiaries. The acquisition expanded Nordson&rsquo;s core capabilities in precision dispensing technology, helping it foray into the rapidly growing, precision agriculture end-market. ARAG is part of the Industrial Precision Solutions segment. Also, in November 2022, Nordson acquired CyberOptics Corporation, expanding its semiconductor test and inspection capabilities.<br /><br />Nordson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). In the past three months, the stock has gained 10.1% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 3.7% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d2/75597.jpg?v=661930330" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rewards to Shareholders:</strong> NDSN continues to increase shareholders&rsquo; value through dividend payments and share repurchases. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024, it paid out dividends of $116.8 million, up 4.8% year over year. In the same period, it bought back shares worth $34.1 million. In August 2024, the company hiked its dividend by 15% to 78 cents per share. This marks its 61st consecutive year of dividend increase.&nbsp;<br /><br />In September 2022, the company&rsquo;s board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million in shares on top of the existing share repurchase authorization. Exiting the fiscal third quarter, it had approximately $0.52 million available of the total $1.5 million authorized for share repurchases.</p><h2>Other Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other top-ranked companies from the same space are discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Flowserve Corporation </strong>FLS currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />FLS delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 18.2%.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Maplebear (CART) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given a notable revision in the company's earnings estimates. While the stock has been gaining lately, the trend might continue since its earnings outlook is still improving.</p><p>Analysts' growing optimism on the earnings prospects of this operator of the Instacart online grocery is driving estimates higher, which should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Over the past month, six estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revisions, helping the consensus estimate increase 12.19%.</p><p><h2>Favorable Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>Thanks to promising estimate revisions, Maplebear currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

<![CDATA[ Will Nvidia (NVDA) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 16:10:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Nvidia (NVDA). This company, which is in the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.</p><p>When looking at the last two reports, this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 11.98%, on average, in the last two quarters.</p><p>For the last reported quarter, Nvidia came out with earnings of $0.61 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.55 per share, representing a surprise of 10.91%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.46 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.52 per share, delivering a surprise of 13.04%.</p><p>For Nvidia, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.</p><p>Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.</p><p>The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.</p><p>Nvidia has an Earnings ESP of +1.23% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on August 28, 2024.</p><p>With the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.</p><p>Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.</p><p>Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327845/will-nvidia-nvda-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_7-2327845">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Stratasys Gears Up to Report Q2 Earnings: Key Factors to Note ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 16:08:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stratasys</strong> SSYS is slated to release second-quarter 2024 results on Aug. 29.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Stratasys&rsquo; second-quarter revenues is pegged at $148.08 million, indicating a year-over-year decrease of 7.31%. The consensus mark for the bottom line is pegged at a loss of 4 cents per share. SSYS posted non-GAAP earnings of 4 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters, matched once and missed once, the average surprise being 58.33%.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s see how things have shaped up before the upcoming announcement.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stratasys, Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Stratasys, Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/d5/1724762436.png" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Stratasys, Ltd. price-eps-surprise | Stratasys, Ltd. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The year-over-year expected decline in top and bottom lines is due to divestitures of certain businesses and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Nonetheless, Stratasys&rsquo; second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from steady demand for its products and solutions.&nbsp;<br /><br />With many engineers, designers, architects and entrepreneurs resorting to 3D solutions for their primary designing and product modeling, the 3D printing market is becoming a favorable long-term investment opportunity. This trend is likely to have spurred the demand for Stratasys&rsquo; 3D products and solutions in the second quarter. In the quarter to be reported, Stratasys announced its new SAF HighDef Printing capabilities and the launch of the H350 printer, Version 1.5 (V.1.5), to expand SAF adoption with additional applications and use cases for a growing set of manufacturing end markets.<br /><br />SSYS also launched the J5 Digital Anatomy 3D printer, which is designed to meet the rising need for affordable and high-fidelity anatomical models. An improvement in product quality and performance, along with multiple product launches, is expected to have boosted the firm&rsquo;s performance.<br /><br />The company announced updates to several Industrial and Healthcare Business Unit products and Stratasys Direct. These include a new open platform for the F900 3D printer, more on-demand 3D printing capabilities and a new high-performance material for its Fused Deposition Modeling line. These product launches with enhanced capabilities are likely to have helped the company gain new customers in the to-be-reported quarter.<br /><br />However, the weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic issues has led enterprises to postpone their large IT spending plans. This might have hurt Stratasys&rsquo; top line in the second quarter. Additionally, inflation and increased component costs are likely to have weighed on Stratasys&rsquo; profitability in the quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What Our Model Says</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for SSYS this season.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Roche</strong> RHHBY announced that the European Commission (EC) approved PiaSky (crovalimab) for treating patients suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PiaSky is a novel recycling monoclonal antibody that inhibits the complement protein C5. Per Roche, the drug is the first monthly subcutaneous (SC) treatment for people with PNH.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The EC approved the drug for adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older with a weight of 40 kg and above) suffering from PNH who are either new to or have been previously treated with C5 inhibitors.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Roche&rsquo;s shares have gained 15.2% year to date compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 27.1%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/cc/75600.jpg?v=467242770" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Positive Study Results Help RHHBY</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The approval is based on results from the phase III COMMODORE 2 study in people with PNH who have not been previously treated with C5 inhibitors. Results of the study demonstrated that PiaSky, administered as SC injections every four weeks, achieved disease control and was well-tolerated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The study also showed that SC PiaSky once a month was equivalent to intravenous eculizumab every two weeks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Eculizumab, an existing standard of care C5 inhibitor, is marketed as Soliris by <strong>Astrazeneca</strong> AZN.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The application included supportive data from two additional late-stage studies, the COMMODORE 1 study, in people with PNH switching from currently approved C5 inhibitors and the COMMODORE 3 study in people new to C5 inhibitor treatment in China.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PiaSky is also approved in the United States and Japan, based on results of the COMMODORE studies.</p><h2>Roche&rsquo;s Development Program For Crovalimabin</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Roche is also evaluating crovalimabin, a broad clinical development program, including five phase III studies and three earlier phase studies in complement-mediated diseases, including PNH, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and sickle cell disease.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">PNH is a rare and life-threatening blood condition wherein red blood cells are destroyed by the complement system &ndash; part of the innate immune system. The condition causes symptoms such as anemia, fatigue and blood clots, and potentially leading to kidney disease.</p><h2>How Does the PNH Drug Approval Help RHHBY?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Approval of new drugs and label expansion of the existing ones will further strengthen Roche&rsquo;s strong and diverse portfolio.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Drugs like Vabysmo, Ocrevus, Hemlibra and Polivy fuel RHHBY&rsquo;s top line as the company faces competition from biosimilars for established drugs like Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">AZN also has another PNH drug in its portfolio- Ultomiris. Both Soliris and Ultomiris were added to AZN&rsquo;s portfolio through the acquisition of erstwhile Alexion.</p><h2>Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Roche currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some top-ranked stocks from the drug/biotech industry are <strong>Eli Lilly</strong> LLY and <strong>Exelixis </strong>EXEL, both carrying the same rank as Roche at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Earnings estimates for 2024 have risen from $13.71 to $15.77 per share in the past 30 days. For 2025, the bottom-line estimate has been increased from $19.42 to $22.79 over the same timeframe. Year to date, Lilly&rsquo;s shares have risen 65%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, estimates for EXEL&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share have moved north to $1.79 from $1.39. Year to date, shares of EXEL have risen 6.2%.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327876/roche-obtains-approval-for-its-rare-blood-disorder-drug-in-the-eu?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_medical_sector-2327876">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Investors might want to bet on Corcept Therapeutics (CORT), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.</p><p>A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.</p><p>Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.</p><p>Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Corcept basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.</p><p><h2>Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices</h2></p><p>The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.</p><p>Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Corcept imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.</p><p><h2>Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions</h2></p><p>Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.7%.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.</p><p>You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>></p><p>The upgrade of First Financial to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327835/what-makes-first-financial-ffin-a-new-strong-buy-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_12_zacks_rank_upgrade-2327835">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be "buying high, but hoping to sell even higher." With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.</p><p>Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.</p><p>Below, we take a look at <b>Arch Capital Group (ACGL)</b>, a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.</p><p>It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Arch Capital Group currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.</p><p>You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>></p><p><h2>Set to Beat the Market?</h2></p><p>Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ACGL that show why this property and casualty insurer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.</p><p>A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand.

Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 12.86% compares favorably with the industry's 3.01% performance as well.</p><p>While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Arch Capital Group have risen 7.66%, and are up 47.58% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 6.22% and 29.02%, respectively.</p><p>Investors should also take note of ACGL's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish.

<![CDATA[ <p>Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be "buying high, but hoping to sell even higher." And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction.

It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.</p><p>For CURI, shares are up 5.36% over the past week while the Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is up 2.64% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 10% compares favorably with the industry's 0.13% performance as well.</p><p>Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of CuriosityStream Inc. Have increased 16.35% over the past quarter, and have gained 49.16% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 6.22% and 29.02%, respectively.</p><p>Investors should also pay attention to CURI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. CURI is currently averaging 153,936 shares for the last 20 days.</p><p><h2>Earnings Outlook</h2></p><p>The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with CURI.</p><p>Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CURI's consensus estimate, increasing from -$0.19 to -$0.15 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CURI is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep CuriosityStream Inc.

<![CDATA[ DexCom Stock May Gain on Expanded Reach After Stelo's US Launch ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>DexCom Inc. </strong>DXCM recently announced the availability of Stelo, the first over-the-counter (OTC) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) biosensor in the United States. The biosensor is available for purchase without a prescription at Stelo.com.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Dexcom glucose biosensors are a vital and effective tool for managing diabetes as they produce good clinical results independent of medication use and may even be able to slow down the disease&#39;s progression. Glucose biosensors, such as Stelo, can increase the efficacy of GLP-1 drugs in a world where their usage is becoming more widespread.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expansion in the underpenetrated Type 2 diabetes market should support DXCM&rsquo;s top-line growth going forward, leading to higher investor interests and driving share price higher. However, competition from rival products will be a concern.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>More on Dexcom&rsquo;s Stelo OTC Biosensor</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per CDC, about 38 million people living in the United States are diagnosed with diabetes and approximately 90-95% of people have Type 2 diabetes. It is found in people aged 45 years and older. However, Type 2 diabetes is now common in children and young adults.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Stelo was developed keeping in mind the unique needs of people aged 18 years and older with Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin. The device is a small, wearable sensor worn on the back of the upper arm that provides glucose insights directly to a user&rsquo;s smartphone. Stelo&rsquo;s software is designed to onboard people who have never used a CGM, as well as to educate them about what blood glucose means and how changes throughout the day are normal. The product&rsquo;s main purpose is to help people manage their diet and activities to lower their average glucose.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Dexcom announced the FDA clearance of its Stelo OTC glucose biosensor to consumers without a prescription in March 2024. The G7, the company&#39;s most recent CGM sensor, is presently prescribed. With Stelo&#39;s availability for non-prescription use, people without insurance coverage for CGM would have even easier access to state-of-the-art CGM technology.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Abbott&rsquo;s Libre Rio CGM &mdash; Dexcom&rsquo;s Direct Competitor</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">While Dexcom&rsquo;s Stelo CGM is set to target people with Type 2 diabetes who do not take insulin, <strong>Abbott</strong> ABT, on the other hand, will split its OTC CGM into two sensors: Lingo, which is intended for people who do not have diabetes, and Libre Rio, which will compete more directly with Dexcom&rsquo;s Stelo for Type 2, non-insulin users.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Abbott announced the FDA clearance of its Lingo &amp; Libre Rio CGMs, which are based on ABT&#39;s world-leading FreeStyle Libre&nbsp;CGM technology, in June 2024. Libre Rio&nbsp;is Abbott&#39;s first OTC CGM system for people with diabetes in the United States. It is designed for people aged 18 and older with Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin and typically manage their diabetes through lifestyle modifications.&nbsp;Libre Rio&nbsp;is the first OTC CGM system with a measurement range of 40-400 mg/dL, allowing for the measurement of extremely low or high glucose events.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Abbott also intends to launch an e-commerce website this summer to offer its wellness-focused Lingo device. The company has not yet revealed any schedule for Libre Rio.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With Abbott launching its CGMs for use in the United States, Dexcom&rsquo;s Stelo is likely to face competition in securing a major share of the market. Effective marketing techniques and after sale services can prove beneficial to increase revenues and induce customer retention.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Industry Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global digital diabetes management market size was estimated at $18.9 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $35.8 billion by 2028 at a growth rate of 13.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The market is being driven by escalating diabetes care solutions and technological developments that have made it possible to introduce highly adaptable solutions. Other significant drivers include the increasing popularity of the use of connected devices and apps as well as the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The availability of Stelo in the United States may lead to higher demand for the product in the CGM segment, thereby generating higher sales. Given the market potential, the availability of Stelo glucose biosensor is likely to provide a significant boost to Dexcom&rsquo;s business.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>DXCM&rsquo;s Notable Developments</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In August 2024, DXCM announced that its G7 CGM System will be added to the R&eacute;gie de l&#39;assurance maladie du Qu&eacute;bec Public Prescription Drug Insurance Plan. Qu&eacute;bec residents living with type 1 diabetes who meet the eligibility criteria are now likely to receive coverage for Dexcom G7.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In June 2024, Dexcom announced the integration of its Dexcom G6 CGM system with Insulet&rsquo;s Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System for Type 1 diabetes patients in the Netherlands for an easier diabetes management experience.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The combination system is intended to improve patient&#39;s quality of life by providing greater mobility without the concern of dislodging tubes. It is the first Hybrid Closed Loop system without tubes to be authorized for use in children in the Netherlands.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the year-to-date period, DXCM&rsquo;s shares have plunged 40.6% against the industry&rsquo;s growth of 8.5%. The S&amp;P 500 returned 17.8% in the same time frame.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/be/75519.jpg?v=126621381" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">DXCM carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are&nbsp;<strong>Universal Health Service</strong>&nbsp;UHS and&nbsp;<strong>ABM Industries</strong>&nbsp;ABM.

<![CDATA[ Crocs Stock Rises 50% Year to Date: What's Next for Investors? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 15:48:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Crocs, Inc</strong>. CROX has displayed an impressive performance so far this year, with its shares appreciating 50% year to date. This growth is notable against the industry&rsquo;s decline of 22.9%. Additionally, the stock fared better than the broader S&amp;P 500 index, which recorded gains of 17.8%. The bullishness in the stock is fueled by high consumer interest in the brand, successful pricing strategies and lower shipping expenses.<br /><br />Closing at $140.07 on Aug. 26, the stock trades close to its 52-week high mark of $165.32 reached on June 20. The current price also reflects a 15.3% discount from the 52-week high mark, indicating that the stock has further upside potential from here. Moreover, the stock&rsquo;s current level reflects a premium of 89% from its 52-week low.&nbsp;<br /><br />The technical indicators show that the stock is trading above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, indicating strong upward momentum and suggesting sustained investor confidence in the company&#39;s performance.<br /><br />The question arises here whether it is prudent to buy CROX&rsquo;s shares after the recent rally. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the Crocs&rsquo; underlying fundamentals.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8e/75564.jpg?v=1675664195" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Uncovering the Opportunities for CROX</h2><p>This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been benefiting from strong consumer demand across its Crocs and HEYDUDE brands, bolstered by effective pricing strategies. The company has seen robust performances in clogs, sandals and personalization, with second-quarter 2024 growth driven by the Classic Clog.<br /><br />Crocs is making significant strides in its long-term strategy and key initiatives aimed at delivering sustainable growth. The company&#39;s growth strategy revolves around three main initiatives: igniting iconic products across both brands to boost customer awareness and relevance; strategically investing in Tier 1 markets to increase market share through enhanced talent, marketing, digital efforts and retail expansion; and diversifying its product range to attract a broader consumer base.<br /><br />CROX has achieved notable growth in brand awareness and desirability through strategic collaborations with well-known names like Toy Story and Hello Kitty, as well as emerging brands like Klott. The partnership with luxury brand Simone Rocha further strengthens its position in the high-end market. The launch of Echo Storm through direct-to-consumer channels and partnerships with Foot Locker and JD Sports has shown promising results.<br /><br />Looking ahead, the company aims to exceed $5 billion in revenues by 2026, witnessing a five-year compound annual growth rate of more than 17%. This target is expected to be achieved through robust digital sales, increased market share for sandals, growth in Asia and innovations in product and marketing. Management anticipates a fourfold increase in revenues from sandals by 2026.</p><h2>Understanding the Roadblocks for CROX</h2><p>Crocs has been grappling with rising costs stemming from the HEYDUDE acquisition, and distribution and logistics inefficiencies, leading to higher selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses. In the second quarter, SG&amp;A expenses rose 19.4%, driven by continued investments in talent, marketing and direct-to-consumer initiatives to enhance market share.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s wholesale business for HEYDUDE is facing challenges, and management expects these difficulties to persist through the second half of 2024. The company has expressed caution regarding consumer spending trends, the geopolitical environment and the timing of SG&amp;A investments.</p><h2>CROX&rsquo;s Undervalued Valuation</h2><p>With the stock steadily ticking up, the company is currently trading at a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 10.30X, below the industry average of 12.36X and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s average of 21.72X. Currently, CROX&rsquo;s stock is undervalued relative to its peers.<br /><br />A lower P/E ratio is usually an attractive opportunity for investors looking to accumulate shares, especially if they believe the company&#39;s future earnings will exceed current market expectations.</p><h2>3 CROX Peers Showing Potential</h2><p>Some better-ranked stocks are<strong> Wolverine World Wide</strong> WWW, <strong>Kontoor Brands Inc.</strong> KTB and <strong>Funko, Inc. </strong>FNKO.<br /><br />Wolverine World Wide designs, manufactures and distributes of a wide variety of casual and active apparel and footwear. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong><br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WWW&rsquo;s current financial-year sales indicates a decline of almost 23% from the year-ago reported figures. The consensus mark for EPS reflects significant growth to 85 cents from 5 cents reported in the prior year. WWW has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.5%, on average.&nbsp;<br /><br />Kontoor Brands is a lifestyle apparel company that designs, produces, distributes and licenses denim, apparel, footwear and accessories under the Wrangler and Lee brands. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for KTB&rsquo;s 2024 earnings and sales indicates growth of 12.7% and 0.1%, respectively, from the 2023 reported figures. KTB has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.3%, on average.<br /><br />Funko, a pop culture consumer products company, carries a Zacks Rank #2. FNKO has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 87.6%, on average.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Funko&rsquo;s current financial-year sales indicates a decline of 1.7% from the year-ago reported figures. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at break-even results compared with a loss of 87 cents reported in the prior year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327871/crocs-stock-rises-50-year-to-date-what-s-next-for-investors?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|price_surge_/_plunge-2327871">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ John Bean's Marel Takeover Extended by Iceland Regulator ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 15:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>John Bean Technologies Corporation</strong> JBT has announced that the Financial Supervisory Authority of the Central Bank of Iceland has granted an extension to its voluntary takeover bid for Marel. This will buy JBT and Marel more time to secure regulatory approvals to close the transaction.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">John Bean&rsquo;s takeover offer for Marel was previously set to expire on Sep. 2, 2024. It will now close on either Nov. 11, 2024 or three weeks after obtaining all regulatory clearances.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The resulting entity, JBT Marel Corporation, will bring together two companies with complementary product portfolios, reputed brands and advanced technology.</p><h2>JBT&rsquo;s Acquisition Pursuit for Marel</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Iceland-based Marel manufactures equipment and provides other services to the poultry, meat and fish industries. JBT had been trying to acquire Marel since November 2023. It had made the first offer to Marel at &euro;3.15 per share, which it subsequently increased to &euro;3.40 per share in December 2023. On Jan. 19, 2024, John Bean made an updated offer at &euro;3.60 per share.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In April 2024, both parties signed a definitive transaction agreement at the offer price of &euro;3.60 per share, which was also approved by the boards of directors of both John Bean and Marel.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On June 24, 2024, John Bean announced that Iceland&#39;s financial regulator had approved the offer document and prospectus related to the takeover bid for Marel.&nbsp; On Aug. 8, JBT announced that its shareholders had voted in favor of the merger.</p><h2>Financial Details of the John Bean-Marel Deal</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per the agreement, Marel shareholders will have a choice in how to receive payment for their shares. In exchange for each Marel share, they can opt for either all cash (&euro;3.60 per share) or 0.0407 JBT shares. They can also opt for a mix of both (&euro;1.26 in cash and 0.0265 JBT shares). The offer, set to expire on Sep. 2, 2024, has now been extended.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the proration feature and the agreed-upon John Bean&rsquo;s reference share price of $96.25 per share, the final compensation mix is expected at 65% stock and 35% cash. Marel stockholders will receive &euro;950 million in cash and own approximately 38% of the combined company.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">JBT expects to use some of its existing cash on hand to finance the transaction. It will also use a &euro;1.9 billion fully committed bridge financing facility to guarantee the funding of the cash portion of the transaction, pay off Marel&#39;s outstanding debt, refinance its existing debt and pay transaction fees and related expenses.</p><h2>Synergy Potential for JBT Marel Corp</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">JBT Marel has the potential to become a leading and diversified global food and beverage technology solutions provider. It will be listed on Nasdaq Iceland, subject to approvals, alongside a NYSE listing.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">JBT Marel will likely have proforma annual revenues of $3.5 billion and an adjusted EBITDA margin of around 16%. Within three years of the completion of the transaction, the anticipated cost synergies are expected to exceed $125 million, driven by efficiencies in procurement, manufacturing and general and administrative functions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">JBT Marel is also expected to realize additional revenue synergies of more than $75 million, given attractive cross-selling, go-to-market effectiveness, scaled innovation and enhanced global customer care capabilities. The deal is further anticipated to be accretive to earnings per share within the first full year of closing.</p><h2>John Bean Stock&rsquo;s Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">John Bean&rsquo;s shares have lost 9.2% year to date against the industry&rsquo;s 20.9% growth.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1e/75579.jpg?v=2147161076" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>JBT&rsquo;s Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">John Bean currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Better-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are <strong>Mueller Water Products</strong> MWA, <strong>Northwest Pipe Company</strong> NWPX and <strong>Packaging Corporation of America</strong> PKG. Each of these companies currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&#39;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mueller Water Products&rsquo; 2024 earnings is pegged at 93 cents per share, which indicates year-over-year growth of 47.6%. The consensus estimate for earnings has gone up 17.7% in the past 60 days. The company has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 64.1%. MWA shares have gained 45.1% year to date.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Northwest Pipe has an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 20.15%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NWPX&rsquo;s 2024 earnings is pinned at $2.96 per share, which indicates year-over-year growth of 41.6%. Estimates have moved 20.3% north in the past 60 days. The company&rsquo;s shares have gained 48.4% so far this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PKG&rsquo;s 2024 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 0.1%. Packaging Corp has an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.60%. Estimates have moved 4.6% north in the past 60 days.

<![CDATA[ Ocugen to Begin Phase III Study on Eye Drug in Canada, Stock Up ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ocugen, Inc.</strong> OCGN announced that Health Canada has provided it a No Objection Letter to initiate the phase III liMeliGhT study evaluating its modifier gene therapy product candidate, OCU400, for treating retinitis pigmentosa (RP).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of OCGN were up 4.6% on Aug. 26 following the announcement of the news.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ocugen has already received clearance from the FDA to initiate a phase III study on OCU400 for the treatment of RP, a rare genetic disorder that can lead to vision loss and blindness.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The FDA had previously granted orphan drug and regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation to OCU400 for treating RP.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The study in Canada will run simultaneously with the study in the United States, which is aimed at offering a gene-agnostic treatment option for patients in the United States and Canada. Per the company, there are around 10,000 patients in Canada and 1.6 million patients worldwide with RP. Hence, the study is likely to help reach a broader patient population encompassing many gene mutations associated with RP.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">OCGN Stock Outperforming Industry</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Ocugen have skyrocketed 136.6% so far this year against the industry&rsquo;s decline of 0.2%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c0/75587.jpg?v=175371996" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this month, the company reported its second-quarter results and announced updates on its pipeline candidates, including OCU400.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">OCGN is dosing subjects in the phase III liMeliGhT study investigating OCU400 for the treatment of RP.&nbsp; The disease is associated with mutations in more than 100 genes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The phase III study will enroll 150 participants into two study arms. One study arm will constitute 75 participants with RHO gene mutations and the other will have 75 participants who are gene agnostic.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The primary endpoint of the study is the Luminance Dependent Navigation Assessment.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">RP Market Holds Potential for OCGN</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The RP market represents significant potential. Per the company, there is only a single marketed product to treat one of the 100 gene mutations associated with RP, and the gene-agnostic mechanism of action for OCU400 provides hope for a much larger RP patient population.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of June 30, 2024, Ocugen&rsquo;s cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $16 million. This is expected to extend the company&rsquo;s cash runaway into the third quarter of 2025.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Ocugen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the biotech sector are <strong>Illumina, Inc.</strong> ILMN and <strong>Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc.</strong> FULC, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, estimates for Illumina&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share have moved up from $1.07 to $3.16. Earnings per share estimates for 2025 have improved from $2.93 to $4.50. Year to date, shares of ILMN have lost 6.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ILMN&rsquo;s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 463.46%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, estimates for Fulcrum Therapeutics&rsquo; 2024 loss per share have narrowed from $1.24 to 48 cents. Loss per share estimates for 2025 have narrowed from $1.71 to $1.51. Year to date, shares of FULC have jumped 44.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">FULC&rsquo;s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 393.18%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327799/ocugen-to-begin-phase-iii-study-on-eye-drug-in-canada-stock-up?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_medical_sector-2327799">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Investors interested in stocks from the Food - Miscellaneous sector have probably already heard of Kerry Group PLC (KRYAY) and Mondelez (MDLZ). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.</p><p>We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.</p><p>Currently, Kerry Group PLC has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Mondelez has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ <p>Investors with an interest in Electronics - Miscellaneous Components stocks have likely encountered both OSI Systems (OSIS) and TE Connectivity (TEL). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.</p><p>Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank.

<![CDATA[ PPL Stock Gains 20% Year to Date: What Should Investors Do Now? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 15:38:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>PPL Corp</strong>.&rsquo;s PPL shares have rallied 20% year to date, compared with its industry&rsquo;s growth of 13%. The company continues to provide electricity and natural gas to its 3.5 million customers across the United States. In the same time period, PPL has outperformed its sector and the S&amp;P 500.<br /><br />PPL plans to invest $14.3 billion through 2027 to strengthen its infrastructure and prevent outages. The company is also working to lower emissions from electricity production and develop a net-zero energy system by 2050.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">PPL Outperforms Industry, Sector &amp; S&amp;P YTD</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/2a/75577.jpg?v=1724213595" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Factors Acting as Tailwind for PPL Stock</h2><p>The demand for clean energy is increasing in PPL&rsquo;s service territories and the company is generating more clean energy to meet rising demand. PPL is replacing old coal plants with natural gas, renewables and battery storage. The company is utilizing artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;) and other advanced technologies to better manage supply and demand on the power grid.<br /><br />PPL is experiencing load growth, driven by data center demand located in its Pennsylvania and Kentucky service territories. The company is in an advanced stage of discussion for 5 gigawatts (GW) of electricity supply to the data center operators. PPL can benefit from the rising demand for data centers as the new AI-driven data centers require more electricity compared with conventional data centers. The company can experience more demand from the data centers with over 17 GWs of potential projects in the queue from the 2026 -2033 period.<br /><br />PPL is developing an energy system that is reliable and affordable for customers and continues to make investments to strengthen the grid, electricity transmission and electricity and gas distribution. System hardening will prevent outages and improve restoration times in the face of more frequent and severe storms.<br /><br />PPL is managing its operations efficiently and reducing its operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) expenses by an average of 2.5% annually. The company aims to deliver at least $175M of annual savings by 2026 from 2021. The efficiency drive keeps the rates affordable for customers and will attract more customers.<br /><br />PPL operates in a constructive regulatory jurisdiction. Over 60% of PPL&rsquo;s capital investment plan is subject to &ldquo;contemporaneous recovery,&rdquo; and it reduces the impact of regulatory lag on earnings for investments. The recovery of the capital expenditure quickly allows the company to fund its long-term projects easily.</p><h2>PPL&rsquo;s Earnings Estimates Moving North</h2><p>PPL expects its 2024 EPS in the range of $1.63-$1.75 compared with $1.60 per share registered in 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PPL&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings per share indicates year-over-year growth of 7.5% and 6.7%, respectively. The year-over-year increase in earnings estimates indicates analysts&rsquo; increasing confidence in the stock.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9f/75583.jpg?v=1269271184" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>PPL Stock Returns Higher Than the Industry</h2><p>PPL&rsquo;s trailing 12-month return on assets is 3.3%, ahead of the industry average of 2.8%. Return on asset (ROA) is a financial ratio that measures how well a company uses its assets to generate profit. The current ROA of the company indicates that it is using its assets more efficiently than its peers.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/12/75585.jpg?v=1215221113" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><br />PPL Delivers Value to Shareholders</h2><p>PPL continues to return value to its shareholders through dividend payments.<br /><br />The company expects to increase its earnings per share in the range of 6-8% annually through 2027, subject to its board&rsquo;s approval. The current annual dividend of the company is $1.03. It projects dividend growth of 6-8% per year through 2027, on par with its earnings growth expectation.<br /><br />PPL&rsquo;s payout ratio at the end of 2023 was 59%. With continued strength in its earnings and cash flow growth, PPL is expected to continue boosting its dividend going forward. Check PPL&rsquo;s dividend history here.</p><h2>PPL Currently Trading at a Premium</h2><p>PPL is currently valued at a premium compared to its industry on a forward 12-month P/E basis. Given its high valuation at present, it is better to hold positions in the stock and wait for a better entry point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/44/75590.jpg?v=519864410" style="width: 600px; height: 301px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Summing Up</h2><p>PPL&#39;s investment in increasing clean energy production volumes and strengthening its grid will assist in providing reliable service to its customers. Efficient management of operations and constructive regulatory jurisdiction add to the company&rsquo;s advantage.<br /><br />Given the improvement in earnings estimates and return on assets, it will be wise to remain invested in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) utility.<br /><br />You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327789/ppl-stock-gains-20-year-to-date-what-should-investors-do-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2327789">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company </strong>GT, one of the largest tire manufacturing companies in the world, have plunged 38.8% year to date to close at $8.76 on Monday. Shares of GT&rsquo;s competitors <strong>Bridgestone Corp</strong> BRDCY and <strong>Michelin </strong>MGDDY are down 5.1% and up 10.2%, respectively.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Goodyear YTD Price Comparison with Competitors</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/05/75570.jpg?v=613801621" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Weaker commercial truck business, high debt level and substantial amounts of investment and capital spending are believed to be the primary factors behind the poor performance of Goodyear stock.&nbsp;<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s shares are trading below the 50-day moving average. When a stock trades below its moving average, it could indicate a downtrend or a period of weakness in the stock price.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">GT Stock Trades Below 50-Day Average</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f0/75571.jpg?v=1068834262" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s shares have seen a major dip year to date. Should you buy it, or is it a risky bet? Let&#39;s find out.</p><h2>What&rsquo;s Clouding Goodyear&rsquo;s Prospects?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>High Debt Pile: </strong></em>On June 30, 2024, long-term debt and finance leases rose to $6,832 million from $6,831 million as of Dec. 31, 2023. Notably, Goodyear&rsquo;s long-term debt-to-capital ratio of 0.58 is higher than the auto sector&rsquo;s 0.34. Elevated leverage restricts the firm&#39;s financial flexibility.<br /><br /><em><strong>Soaring Capex to Limit Cash Flows:</strong></em> Technology change requires Goodyear to make substantial amounts of investment and capital spending in order to develop technologically advanced offerings. Capex for 2024 is expected to be around $1.25 billion, up from $1.05 billion in 2023. High spending on account of the upgrades for more complex tire designs and brownfield expansions are likely to clip cash flows.<br /><br /><em><strong> Inflation:</strong></em> While global inflation is showing signs of gradual decline, it remains above pre-pandemic levels. The company expects non-raw material inflation and other costs to be about $60 million higher in the third quarter of 2024 compared with the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s period.<br /><br /><em><strong> Weak Commercial Truck Business:</strong></em> In the commercial truck business, weak fleet industry conditions have impacted the company&#39;s performance. In the first half of 2024, sales totaled $9.11 billion, down 7.1% from last year due to industry weakness. These ongoing challenges are likely to take a hit on the company&#39;s top-line growth in the second half.</p><h2>GT Witnessing Southbound Estimates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GT&rsquo;s 2024 EPS estimate implies a year-over-year decline of 3.83%. In the last seven days, the company has also seen its EPS estimates decline for 2024 and 2025.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Goodyear&rsquo;s higher long-term debt-to-capital ratio compared with that of the auto sector, substantial investment and capital spending on technological development and ongoing weakness in the commercial truck business do not make it appealing. Investors are better off avoiding this stock.<br /><br />Goodyear currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).&nbsp;<br /><br />You can see<strong> the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327866/goodyear-stock-falls-38-8-ytd-buy-the-dip-or-time-to-sell?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2327866">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Box, Inc.</strong> BOX is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug 27.<br /><br />For second-quarter fiscal 2025, BOX expects revenues to be between $268 million and $270 million, suggesting a 3% rise at the high end of the range from the prior fiscal year&rsquo;s reported figure. The constant-currency growth rate is pegged at 6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $269.19 million, indicating 3% growth from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s reported value.<br /><br />Box anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 40-41 cents. The consensus mark for the metric is pegged at 40 cents, suggesting an improvement of 11.1% from the previous-year quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. The bottom line has been unchanged in the past 30 days.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing the mark once, the average beat being 4.12%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Box, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Box, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="304" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/a1/1724772383.png" title="" width="620" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Box, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Box, Inc. Quote</p></div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Factors To Note</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The increased adoption of Box&rsquo;s Content Cloud platform by existing and new customers is expected to have positively impacted the company&rsquo;s performance in the quarter under review.<br /><br />The enhanced security, compliance, data governance and privacy features of BOX&#39;s Content Cloud are likely to have driven the company&rsquo;s momentum among government and private organizations in the to-be-reported quarter.<br /><br />The rising demand for Box AI, driven by enhanced AI features, is likely to have attracted new customers.<br /><br />Box&rsquo;s technology partnership with <strong>NVIDIA </strong>NVDA might have contributed well to the upcoming results. As part of this collaboration, NVIDIA&rsquo;s NIM microservices enable seamless integration of various AI models and capabilities within Box AI to help customers unlock the value of their unstructured content.&nbsp;<br /><br />Box&rsquo;s expanding efforts to enhance its content management capabilities are expected to have been another positive.<br /><br />Its acquisition of Crooze, a provider of no-code enterprise content management applications, might have contributed well.<br /><br />Enhanced capabilities of Box Sign are likely to have continued supporting customers with their validation processes and critical transactions.<br /><br />Box&rsquo;s growing momentum in Enterprise Plus Suites is likely to have boosted its attach rate and driven revenue growth in the quarter under review.<br /><br />However, increasing costs for cloud infrastructure and sales and marketing are likely to have been a persistent concern in the quarter under review.<br /><br />Additionally, growing competition in the cloud industry might have been a significant risk.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">What Our Model Says</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for BOX this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.&nbsp;<br /><br />Box has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />It has a Zacks Rank #3 at present.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks To Consider</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some stocks that you may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this season.<br /><br /><strong>Nutanix </strong>NTNX has an Earnings ESP of +7.48% and carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&#39;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />Nutanix&rsquo;s shares have increased 11.7% year to date. NTNX is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 28.<br /><br /><strong>Pure Storage</strong> PSTG has an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.<br /><br />Pure Storage&rsquo;s shares have surged 72.4% year to date. PSTG is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug 28.<br /><br />Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327862/box-gears-up-to-report-q2-earnings-here-s-what-to-expect?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2327862">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Is HealthEquity Stock a Hold Now Amid Strong Top-Line Growth? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 15:24:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HealthEquity, Inc.&nbsp;</strong>HQY has been gaining from its business model and strategy. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2025 performance and strength in Health Savings Accounts (HSA) are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and the possibility that integration of acquisitions may be unsuccessful are major downsides.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 11.8% compared with the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 10.1% growth&nbsp;and the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 26.7% rise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The renowned provider of technology-enabled services platforms for healthcare savings and spending decisions has a market capitalization of $6.67 billion. The company projects 28% growth for the next five years and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. HealthEquity&rsquo;s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 17.2%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/ea/75518.jpg?v=71488642" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>K</strong>ey Drivers for HQY Stock&rsquo;s Top Line</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Unique Investment Platform:&nbsp;</strong>HealthEquity offers multiple cloud-based platforms, accessed by its members online via a desktop or mobile device. Individuals can make health saving and spending decisions, and pay healthcare bills, among other activities, via these platforms. These platforms provide users access to services provided by HQY and third parties selected by HealthEquity or its Network Partners. Among other features, HealthEquity&rsquo;s HSA platform has the capability to provide users with medical bills upon adjudication by a health plan, including details, such as the amount paid by insurance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of Jan. 31, 2024, HealthEquity&rsquo;s platforms were integrated with more than 200 Network Partners and are currently serving more than 120,000 clients.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Strength in HSA:&nbsp;</strong>HealthEquity&rsquo;s total number of HSAs, as of April 30, 2024, rose 13.1% year over year. HealthEquity reported 665,000 HSAs with investments as of April 30, 2024, up 19.6% year over year. Total Accounts, as of April 30, 2024, were up 6.7% year over year. This uptick included total HSAs and 6.9 million other consumer-directed benefits (CDB). Total HSA assets as of Apr 30, 2024, were up 22.2% year over year. This included HSA cash and HSA investments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Strong Q1 Results:&nbsp;</strong>HealthEquity exited first-quarter fiscal 2025 with better-than-expected results. The company witnessed solid top-line and bottom-line performances in the reported quarter. The top line benefited from robust contributions from all its revenue sources. Solid growth in HSAs also drove the top line.Management&rsquo;s expectations of the impacts of the BenefitWallet HSA portfolio acquisition raise optimism.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Downsides for HQY</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Data Security Issues:&nbsp;</strong>HealthEquity deals with high level of sensitive personal data and information. Any form of security breaches might result in the loss of sensitive information, theft or loss of actual funds, litigation, or indemnity obligations to the customers.&nbsp;Notably, the company&rsquo;s online platform is hosted from two data centers that are located in Draper, UT and Austin, TX.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stiff Competition:&nbsp;</strong>The competitive landscape for medical services is dynamic and fragmented, posing a serious threat to HealthEquity. Key elements influencing a business&#39; performance include the willingness of customers to use HSAs and other CDBs more frequently, as well as the ability of the business to increase engagement and persuade both present and potential customers of the advantages of its services.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Estimate Trend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">HealthEquity has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2025. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 3.4% north to $3.00.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $284.5 million, implying a 16.8% rise from the year-ago reported number.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are&nbsp;<strong>Universal Health Service</strong>&nbsp;UHS,&nbsp;<strong>Quest Diagnostics&nbsp;</strong>DGX and&nbsp;<strong>ABM Industries</strong>&nbsp;ABM. While Universal Health Service sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Quest Diagnostics and ABM Industries carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each at present. <strong>You can see&nbsp;</strong><strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Universal Health Service has an estimated long-term growth rate of 19%. UHS&rsquo; earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 14.58%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Universal Health Service has gained 41.1% compared with the&nbsp;industry&#39;s&nbsp;34.8% growth so far this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quest Diagnostics has an estimated long-term growth rate of 6.20%. DGX&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 3.31%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quest Diagnostics&rsquo; shares have gained 3.7% so far this year compared with the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s&nbsp;10.2% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ABM Industries&rsquo; earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 7.34%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ABM&#39;s shares have risen 24.1% so far this year compared with the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s&nbsp;11.9% growth.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327851/is-healthequity-stock-a-hold-now-amid-strong-top-line-growth?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2327851">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SoundHound AI</strong> SOUN shares have jumped 135.9% year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector&rsquo;s gain of 21.3% and the Zacks Computers &ndash; IT Services industry&rsquo;s return of 3%.&nbsp;<br /><br />It has outperformed industry peers like <strong>ServiceNow</strong> NOW, <strong>Infosys</strong> INFY and <strong>Vertiv</strong> VRT over the same timeframe. NOW, INFY and VRT shares have gained 17.2%, 22.1% and 62.5%, respectively.<br /><br />SoundHound AI shares have been benefiting from a strong portfolio, a solid partner base and an expanding clientele. SOUN offers conversational intelligence through independent Voice AI solutions in 25 languages in both cloud-enabled and hardware-embedded devices.&nbsp;<br /><br />Its prospects benefit from a massive addressable market worth more than $140 billion that includes diverse industries like automotive, restaurants, customer service, entertainment, Smart TVs and Internet of Things powered devices.<br /><br />However, SOUN&rsquo;s unimpressive second-quarter 2024 results bring this question into investors&rsquo; minds - is it too late to jump into SoundHound AI&rsquo;s bull run?&nbsp;<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s dig deep to find out.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">SOUN Stock Beats Sector YTD</h2><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6d/75574.jpg?v=1391842034" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>SoundHound AI&rsquo;s Q2 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues Meet</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />SoundHound AI reported a loss of 11 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 9 cents. It reported revenues of $13 million, in line with the consensus mark, but up 54% year over year.<br /><br />SoundHound AI had $723 million in cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog at the end of the second quarter of 2024, which doubled year over year. The annual run rate jumped 90% year over year to more than 5 billion queries.<br /><br />SOUN&rsquo;s liquidity position was strong, with a cash balance of $201 million at the end of the second quarter. It prepaid $100 million in debt, which saves more than $55 million in interest and fees.<br /><br />It now expects revenues to be $80 million and $150 million for 2024 and 2025, respectively, including the contribution from the recently announced acquisition of Amelia.&nbsp;<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SOUN&rsquo;s 2024 revenues is pegged at $82.59 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 80.05%. The consensus mark for 2024 loss is pegged at 36 cents per share, which has widened by four cents over the past 30 days.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SOUN&rsquo;s 2025 revenues is pegged at $151.87 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 83.87%. The consensus mark for 2025 loss is pegged at 21 cents per share, unchanged over the past 30 days.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">SoundHound AI, Inc.

Quote</p></div><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>SOUN Shares Overvalued</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />SOUN stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.<br /><br />In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, SoundHound AI is trading at 14.02X, higher than the Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector&rsquo;s 6.35X.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price/Sales Ratio (F12M)</h2><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a1/75575.jpg?v=1004957288" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>SOUN Stock to Benefit From Expanding Footprint</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />SoundHound AI&rsquo;s prospects benefit from its expanding footprint in industries like automotive and restaurants, driven by its innovative portfolio. It has more than 270 patents currently, with over 155 granted and more than 115 pending.<br /><br />The strong demand for SoundHound Chat AI and AI Customer Service solutions is noteworthy. Generative AI (GenAI) presents a significant growth opportunity for SoundHound AI&rsquo;s prospects. Enterprise spending on GenAI is projected to grow 15-fold over the next three years to nearly $250 billion.<br /><br />Automotive presents a significant growth opportunity for SOUN. TAM for the global light vehicle auto market is currently pegged at roughly 88 million and is expected to hit 95 million units by 2028.<br /><br />SOUN has strengthened its footprint in the automotive industry by introducing its advanced SoundHound Chat AI voice assistant, integrated with ChatGPT, into Peugeot, Opel and Vauxhall vehicles across 11 European markets, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.&nbsp;<br /><br />SOUN&rsquo;s collaborations with NVIDIA, ARM, Perplexity, Olo and Oracle are expanding its portfolio. SoundHound AI launched an advanced in-vehicle voice assistant leveraging NVIDIA DRIVE, enabling real-time and generative AI capabilities for seamless, offline access to vehicle intelligence and personalized assistance.<br /><br />SoundHound AI partnered with Perplexity to enhance SoundHound Chat AI through the integration of the latter&rsquo;s online Large Language Model capabilities for advanced, real-time voice assistant responses.<br /><br />TAM for the restaurant market is currently pegged at roughly $3.3 trillion and is expected to hit $4.4 trillion units by 2028, thereby offering significant growth prospects for SoundHound AI.</p><h2>SOUN is a Risky Bet for Investors</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><br />SOUN&rsquo;s innovative portfolio makes it well-positioned to benefit from the strong TAM of global automotive and restaurant markets.<br /><br />However, SoundHound AI currently has a Growth Score of D, which means it is a risky bet for growth-oriented investors. Stretched valuation makes the stock unattractive at this moment.<br /><br />SOUN currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc</strong>. REGN announced that the European Commission (EC) approved odronextamab for treating adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) or R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The drug has been approved under the brand name Ordspono.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The approval is based on results from the phase I ELM-1 and pivotal phase II ELM-2 trials, which demonstrated robust, durable response rates in adults with R/R FL or R/R DLBCL.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Regeneron&rsquo;s shares have rallied 37.3% year to date against the industry&rsquo;s decline of 0.2%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f5/75596.jpg?v=1262470421" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3>Positive Study Results Help REGN</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Results from ELM-2 (n=128), as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC), showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 80%, with 73% achieving a complete response (CR) in R/R FL.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Results from ELM-2 (n=127) in patients who were CAR-T therapy naive, as assessed by an IRC showed 52% ORR, with 31% achieving a CR in R/R DLBLCL.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Results from ELM-1 (n=60) in patients who had progressed after CAR-T therapy, as assessed by an IRC, showed 48% ORR, with 32% achieving a CR.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The approval in the EU is the first regulatory approval of Ordspono in the world for these patients. Ordspono is a bispecific antibody that acts by linking the lymphoma cell to a killer T cell.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Approval in the EU was mostly expected as the European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommended approval of odronextamab.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The EMA previously granted odronextamab Orphan Designation for FL and DLBCL.</p><h3>REGN Suffers Setback With Odronextamab</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier, the company&rsquo;s efforts to get odronextamab approved in the United States suffered a setback. The regulatory body issued complete response letters (CRLs) for its BLA for odronextamab in March 2024. The BLA is seeking the approval of the candidate R/R FL and R/R DLBCL.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The sole issue with the approval is related to the enrollment status of the confirmatory trials.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The CRLs (one for R/R FL and one for R/R DLBCL) did not identify any issue with the clinical efficacy or safety, trial design, labeling or manufacturing.</p><h3>How Will the Approval Help Regeneron?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The successful development of these oncology drugs should be a great boost for REGN. It will also reduce its dependence on sales of lead ophthalmology drug Eylea and profits from asthma drug Dupixent for growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The firm is looking to strengthen its oncology franchise, which currently comprises Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc), indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma, advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company is investigating the use of odronextamab as a monotherapy and in combination across earlier lines of therapy in challenging-to-treat lymphomas. This includes the registrational ELM-1 and ELM-2 studies, the phase III OLYMPIA development program, which is one of the largest clinical programs in lymphoma evaluating odronextamab in earlier lines of therapy and additional B-NHLs and early-stage trials with chemotherapy-free combinations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A phase II study for fianlimab, an antibody to LAG-3, in combination with Libtayo for perioperative non-small cell lung cancer, was also initiated. A phase II/III study for fianlimab, in combination with Libtayo for perioperative melanoma, was also initiated.</p><h3>Regulatory Setbacks Derail REGN</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Last week, REGN received a CRL from the FDA for its BLA for pipeline candidate linvoseltamab.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The BLA is seeking FDA approval for linvoseltamab to treat R/R multiple myeloma that has progressed after at least three prior therapies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Regeneron stated that the sole issue identified in the CRL is related to findings from a pre-approval inspection at a third-party fill/finish manufacturer for another company&rsquo;s product candidate.&nbsp; The CRL delays the potential approval of the candidate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">REGN has a collaboration agreement with <strong>Bayer</strong> BAYRY for Eylea. The company records net product sales of Eylea and Eylea HD in the United States and Bayer records its net product sales outside the country. Regeneron records its share of profits in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Regeneron has a collaboration agreement with <strong>Sanofi</strong> SNY for Dupixent. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent, while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with the global sales of both drugs.</p><h3>Zacks Rank</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327848/regeneron-s-bispecific-antibody-obtains-ec-nod-for-lymphoma?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_medical_sector-2327848">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dell Technologies</strong> DELL is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug 29.<br /><br />Dell expects fiscal second-quarter revenues in the range of $23.5-$24.5 billion, with a midpoint of $24 billion, indicating 5% growth. Earnings are expected to be $1.65 per share (+/- 10 cents).<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $24.29 billion, suggesting 5.91% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />The consensus mark for quarterly earnings is pegged at $1.74 per share, unchanged year over year. The consensus estimate for earnings has increased 1.2% in the past 30 days.<br /><br />Dell&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an earnings surprise of 27.66% on average.&nbsp;<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s see how things have shaped up for DELL shares prior to this announcement:</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Dell Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise <img alt="Dell Technologies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/53/1724766214.png" style="width: 620px; height: 263px;" title="" /> </h3><p>Dell Technologies Inc. price-eps-surprise | Dell Technologies Inc. Quote</p></div><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>Factors to Note for DELL<br />&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Dell is well-poised to report solid results in the fiscal second quarter, driven by its portfolio strength and an expanding partner base that includes the likes of <strong>NVIDIA</strong> NVDA, CrowdStrike, Nokia, AMD, Ericsson, Intel and Commvault, among others.<br /><br />Dell shares have further room for expansion, given the robust demand for AI-optimized servers. In the fiscal first quarter, AI-optimized server orders increased to $2.6 billion, with shipments up more than 100% sequentially to $1.7 billion.<br /><br />However, weak PC shipment due to sluggishness in the consumer segment is expected to have hurt DELL&rsquo;s top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />Per IDC, DELL is the only vendor that witnessed a shipment decline in the second quarter of 2024. DELL&rsquo;s shipments are expected to have declined 2.4% year over year. It, along with <strong>HP</strong> HPQ, also lost market share, per the IDC report.</p><h2>DELL Shares Outperform Sector<br />&nbsp;</h2><p>Year to date, Dell shares have returned 46%, outperforming the broader Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector&rsquo;s return of 22.2% and the Zacks Computer-Micro industry&rsquo;s gain of 18.2%.<br /><br />Except for NVIDIA, Dell Technologies shares have outperformed peers, including HPQ, <strong>Apple</strong> AAPL, and Lenovo.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Year-to-Date Performance Chart</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f3/75567.jpg?v=1269414969" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DELL stock is cheap, as the Value Score of A suggests.<br /><br />Dell stock is trading at a significant discount with a forward 12-month Price/Earnings (P/E) of 12.59X compared with the Zacks Computer- Micro Computers industry&rsquo;s 30.08X.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">P/E Ratio (F12M)</h2><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/51/75569.jpg?v=139227973" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Dell Stock Rides on Strong Portfolio, Partner Base<br />&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">DELL shares are riding on strong demand for AI servers driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI (GenAI) applications.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dell AI Factory launch has been a key catalyst. It combines Dell&rsquo;s solutions and services optimized for AI workloads and supports an open ecosystem of partners comprising NVIDIA, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Hugging Face.<br /><br />NVIDIA has played a pivotal role in developing the Dell AI Factory. The collaboration integrates Dell&rsquo;s portfolio with NVIDIA&rsquo;s AI Enterprise software platform and Tensor Core GPUs, enhancing compute power and simplifying AI application development and deployment for faster time to value.<br /><br />Dell and Ericsson are collaborating to develop tailored network cloud infrastructure plans and advise communications service providers on their cloud transformation journeys. The commercial introduction of Ericsson Cloud RAN software on Dell PowerEdge servers with continuous testing and lifecycle management is noteworthy.<br /><br />Strong demand for AI servers drives Dell stock&rsquo;s prospects. It has shipped more than $3 billion of AI servers over the past three quarters. Its AI server backlog was $3.8 billion, up sequentially by roughly $900 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025.<br /><br />DELL expects the momentum to continue in fiscal 2025, driven by a strong portfolio of AI-optimized solutions and an expanding partner base.</p><h2>What Should Investors Do With DELL Stock?<br />&nbsp;</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Dell&rsquo;s robust portfolio and expanding partner base are key drivers that make the stock attractive for long-term investors. Hence, investors who already own the stock may expect the company&#39;s growth prospects to be rewarding over the long term.<br /><br />However, the Growth Style Score of D suggests that DELL&rsquo;s growth prospects are lackluster in the near term. A contraction in fiscal 2025 gross margin of roughly 150 basis points due to high input costs, stiff competition and an unfavorable mix of AI-optimized servers is hard to ignore for growth-oriented investors.<br /><br />DELL shares are also trading below the 50-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">DELL Shares Trade Below 50-Day SMA</h2><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c4/75568.jpg?v=643597048" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>DELL currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.<br /><br />Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327770/should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-dell-stock-ahead-of-q2-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2327770">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Hain Celestial Group, Inc.</strong> HAIN posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with the top line declining year over year but surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line rose year over year and beat the consensus mark.<br /><br />The fiscal 2024 marked a pivotal year for the company&rsquo;s Hain Reimagined strategy, during which it made significant strides in simplifying its operations and driving growth. The transition to a global operating model helped reduce geographic complexity, enhance scale and foster a performance-driven, values-based culture. Looking ahead to the fiscal 2025, HAIN plans to focus on commercial execution to boost both top- and bottom-line growth. Management remains confident in the Hain Reimagined strategy, emphasizing the strength of the company&#39;s diversified portfolio and global footprint.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">More on Hain Celestial&rsquo;s Q4 Financial Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">HAIN posted adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents. The bottom line increased from adjusted earnings of 11 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />Net sales of $419 million beat the consensus estimate of $418.2 million. The top line declined 6% year over year. Organic sales fell 4% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="268" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/1f/1724768862.png" title="" width="570" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The adjusted gross profit of almost $98 million fell 3.7% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s figure. In comparison, the adjusted gross margin expanded 70 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure to 23.4%. We had expected the adjusted gross margin to expand 40 bps to 23.1%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SG&amp;A expenses came in at $72.3 million, up from $66.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />Adjusted EBITDA stood at $40 million down from $44 million reported in the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. The adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 30 bps to 9.4%. We had expected an adjusted EBITDA margin contraction of 80 bps to 8.9%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">HAIN Provides Q4 Revenue &amp; Profit Insights by Segment</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Net sales in the <strong>North America</strong> segment tumbled 8% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure to $260 million. Segmental organic net sales fell 5% year over year, mainly due to reduced personal care sales, partly owing to portfolio simplification and a decline in infant formula sales within the baby and kids category. This drop was partially offset by growth in the snacks segment. We expected North America&rsquo;s sales to fall 7.6% to $260.3 million in the reported quarter.<br /><br />The segment&rsquo;s adjusted EBITDA amounted to $21 million, down from $27 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter dropped to 8% from 9.6% reported in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />The <strong>International</strong> segment&rsquo;s net sales fell 4% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure to $159 million. Segmental organic net sales also fell 4% year over year, primarily due to lower sales in plant-based meat alternatives within the meal prep category and a decline in snacks. The downside was partially offset by growth in the beverages segment. We had anticipated the segment&rsquo;s sales to decline 6.6% to $155.1 million in the reported quarter.<br /><br />The segment&rsquo;s adjusted EBITDA was $27 million, flat year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter expanded 40 bps to 17%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/5e/75586.jpg?v=1083651962" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">HAIN&rsquo;s Financial Snapshot: Cash, Debt and Equity Overview</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ended the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $54.3 million, long-term debt (excluding the current portion) of $736.5 million and total shareholders&rsquo; equity of $942.9 million.<br /><br />The company reported cash provided by operating activities of $39 million and a free cash flow of $31 million during the quarter under review.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What Lies Ahead For Hain Celestial?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">For fiscal 2025, management expects organic net sales to be stable or show improvement year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to grow by mid-single digits and gross margin is anticipated to rise by at least 125 basis points. Additionally, the company forecasts generating at least $60 million in free cash flow for the year.<br /><br />The company&rsquo;s shares have dropped 3.1% in the past three months against the industry&rsquo;s 2.4% growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Chef&#39;s Warehouse</strong> CHEF, which distributes specialty food products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). CHEF has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 33.7%, on average. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for The Chef&rsquo;s Warehouse&rsquo;s current fiscal year sales and earnings indicates growth of 9.7% and 12.6%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.<br /><br /><strong>Vital Farms</strong> VITL offers a range of produced pasture-raised foods. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). VITL has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 82.5%, on average.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vital Farms&rsquo; current financial-year sales and earnings indicate growth of 26.3% and 88.1%, respectively, from the prior-year reported level.<br /><br /><strong>Nomad Foods</strong> NOMD, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, manufactures and distributes frozen foods.

<![CDATA[ Goldman Sachs, HSBC & Others to Pay $20M Over Metal Trading Probe ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> GS and <strong>HSBC Holdings plc</strong> HSBC, along with the other two companies, have settled a long-standing class action lawsuit, putting an end to claims of market manipulation in the platinum and palladium markets that have persisted for over a decade.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The other defendants in the lawsuit are German industrial company <strong>BASF</strong> BASFY and London-based ICBC Standard Bank.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">GS, HSBC, BASFY and ICBC Standard Bank have agreed to pay $20 million to settle the long-standing platinum price-fixing antitrust lawsuit.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The settlement resolves claims that firms manipulated the prices of palladium and platinum, two essential metals used in several industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods in Manhattan accepted a preliminary settlement of the proposed class action on Friday, marking a milestone in the lawsuit dating back to 2014.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><br />Metal Price-Fixing Lawsuit at a Glance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The platinum price-fixing case accused the four defendants of colluding to manipulate platinum and palladium prices between Jan. 1, 2008, and Nov. 30, 2014. This alleged manipulation includes sharing confidential consumer data, anticipating pricing adjustments and initiating fraudulent &lsquo;spoof&rsquo; orders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Reportedly, price manipulation that benefited the banks affected platinum and palladium, two elements essential to the manufacturing of catalytic converters for lowering automobile emissions and in jewelry and dentistry.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The plaintiffs, who were purchasers of these metals and related futures contracts, claimed that the collusion unfairly reduced prices, lowering costs for the banks and their clients and allowing them to avoid losses on their futures positions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lawyers for the plaintiffs have praised the settlement as a fair and satisfactory resolution. They plan to request up to one-third of the settlement amount or around $6.67 million, in legal fees and up to $600,000 in expenses. Final approval of the deal is expected in January.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><br />Final Words</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The physical commodities businesses of banks have long been the subject of regulatory scrutiny. Manipulating the foreign currency markets and financial benchmarks has resulted in penalties for multiple banks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Several banks are stepping away from the physical commodity industry due to increased regulatory scrutiny and lower profitability. Companies that still deal in tangible commodities are required to shift toward automation to improve transparency and prevent manipulation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This lawsuit is part of a broader trend of litigation in the Manhattan court, where many banks have faced allegations of colluding in various markets, including interest rate benchmarks, U.S. Treasuries, currencies and commodities. Such setbacks are likely to impact the banks&#39; financials.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327844/goldman-sachs-hsbc-others-to-pay-20m-over-metal-trading-probe?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|industry_focus-2327844">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 3 Large-Cap Growth Funds to Buy as Fed Gears Up for Rate Cuts ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 15:07:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Wall Street has resumed its rally as investors are trying to move on from the sharp selloff earlier this month triggered by recession fears. All three major indexes ended in positive territory last week, with the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq closing 1.3%, 1.5% and 1.4% higher, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On Aug 26, the Dow extended its rally, rising 0.2%, to close at a record high of 41,240.52 points. The Wall Street rally is being fueled by hopes that the Federal Reserve will finally start its rate-cut cycle in September.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investing in large-cap growth funds like <strong>Fidelity Contrafund</strong> FCNTX, <strong>Janus Henderson Research A </strong>JRAAX and <strong>T. Rowe Price Lrg Cp Gr I </strong>TRLGX thus seems to be a wise decision.</p><h2>Fed Gears up for Rate Cuts</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">On Aug 23, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that rate cuts were on the horizon during his speech in Jackson Hole, WY.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although Powell didn&rsquo;t signal when or how big the rate cuts would be, his dovish stance gave a boost to investors&rsquo; confidence.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Fed increased interest rates by 525 basis points to take interest rates to a 23-year-high in the range of 5.25-5.5% in its bid to curb inflation. Inflation has since declined substantially and the Federal Reserve is finally confident about starting its easing cycle.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">3 Best Large-Cap Growth Funds</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Lower borrowing costs typically benefit growth-oriented assets, such as technology and consumer discretionary stocks. We have selected three such large-cap growth funds that are poised to gain from the above factors. Moreover, these funds have encouraging three and five-year returns. The minimum initial investment is within $5000.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We expect these funds to outperform their peers in the future. Remember, the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors in identifying potential winners and losers. Unlike most of the fund-rating systems, the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is not just focused on past performance but also on the likely future success of the fund.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The question here is: why should investors consider mutual funds? Reduced transaction costs and diversification of portfolio without several commission charges that are associated with stock purchases are primarily why one should be parking money in mutual funds (read more:&nbsp;Mutual Funds: Advantages, Disadvantages, and How They Make Investors Money).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fidelity Contrafund</strong> seeks capital appreciation. FCNTX invests primarily in the common stock of companies whose value the management believes is not fully recognized by the public.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Fidelity Contrafund has a track of positive total returns for over 10 years. Specifically, FCNTX&rsquo;s returns over the three and five-year benchmarks are 9.6% and 16.8%, respectively. FCNTX has an annual expense ratio of 0.42%, which is lower than the category average of 0.94%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To see how this fund performed compared to its category and other #1 or 2 Ranked Mutual Funds,&nbsp;please click here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Janus Henderson Research A</strong> fund is part of the Large Cap Growth mutual fund category. JRAAX invests in many large U.S. companies that are expected to grow much faster than the other large-cap stocks.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Janus Henderson Research A fund has had a track of positive total returns for over 10 years. Specifically, JRAAX&rsquo;s returns over the three and five-year benchmarks are 8.7% and 16%, respectively. The fund&rsquo;s annual expense ratio is 0.83%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To see how this fund performed compared to its category, and other #1 or 2 Ranked Mutual Funds,&nbsp;please click here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>T. Rowe Price Lrg Cp Gr I</strong> fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation through investments in common stocks of growth companies. TRLGX normally invests at least 80% of net assets in the common stocks of large companies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">T. Rowe Price Lrg Cp Gr I fund has a track of positive total returns for over 10 years. Specifically, TRLGX&rsquo;s returns over the three and five-year benchmarks are 5.4% and 15.9%, respectively. The annual expense ratio of 0.56% is lower than the category average of 0.94%. TRGLX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank #1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To see how this fund performed compared to its category, and other #1 or 2 Ranked Mutual Funds,&nbsp;please click here.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Want key mutual fund info delivered straight to your inbox?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Zacks&#39; free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing mutual funds, each week.&nbsp;Get it free &gt;&gt;</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327765/3-large-cap-growth-funds-to-buy-as-fed-gears-up-for-rate-cuts?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-mutual_fund_commentary-2327765">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Insmed Stock Surges 168% in the Past Six Months: Here's Why ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 15:07:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>Insmed </strong>INSM have more than doubled in market value&nbsp;in the past six months against the industry&rsquo;s 1.1% fall. During this timeframe, the stock has also outperformed the sector and the S&amp;P 500.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The surge in stock price can be attributed to the company&rsquo;s progress with its two pipeline candidates, brensocatib&nbsp;and treprostinil palmitil inhalation powder (TPIP), which are being developed in separate clinical studies targeting multiple lung disorders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s shares are also trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Insmed&rsquo;s Stock Outperforms Industry, Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7a/75541.jpg?v=308296006" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s take a brief look at the factors that were responsible for this price jump.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Encouraging Bronchiectasis Development Aids INSM&rsquo;s Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently the most advanced candidate in Insmed&rsquo;s pipeline, brensocatib was licensed from <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> AZN in 2016 as a potential treatment for multiple neutrophil-driven inflammatory conditions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this May, Insmed reported positive topline results from the phase III ASPEN study, which evaluated brensocatib in patients withnon-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The study met its primary endpoint &mdash; treatment with the drug achieved statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in the annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations (or episodes of worsening disease symptoms) when compared with placebo.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, there are no medications specifically approved to treat bronchiectasis. Per management estimates, nearly a million patients living in the United States, Europe and Japan are affected by the disease.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Based on the above results and target market size, Insmed expects to submit a regulatory filing for brensocatib in bronchiectasis in the fourth quarter of 2024. If approved, the drug could be the first approved treatment for bronchiectasis patients, with a product launch expected in mid-2025. Management expects to commercially launch the drug in Europe and Japan in the first half of 2026.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from bronchiectasis, Insmed is also evaluating brensocatib in the phase IIb BiRCh study in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). A data readout from this study is expected in second-half 2025. Management also intends to initiate a mid-stage study on the drug in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) indication before 2024-end.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">TPIP Study Results Demonstrate INSM&rsquo;s Pipeline Potential</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Management is also evaluating an investigational inhaled formulation of TPIP in separate mid-stage studies for pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) indications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In May, Insmed reported positive top-line safety and tolerability data from a mid-stage study evaluating TPIP in PH-ILD indication. Results from the study showed that treatment with TPIP has the potential to prolong the duration of the effect and reduce dose frequency compared with existing inhaled prostanoid therapies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Management also claimed that a majority of patients (79.3%) who received TPIP reached the maximum dose of 640 micrograms (&micro;g) following five weeks of treatment compared with 100% in the placebo arm. Per management, 640 &micro;g of TPIP dosed one-time daily contains nearly 60% more treprostinil than current market products dosed four times daily.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Based on these results, Insmed plans to start a late-stage study in PH-ILD indication next year. Top-line data from the PAH study is expected in the second half of 2025.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">INSM Aligns With FDA on Arikayce&rsquo;s Confirmatory Study Goal</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this month, INSM announced that it had reached alignment with the FDA on the primary endpoint of the phase III ENCORE study evaluating Arikayce as a potential treatment for newly-infected patients with mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease. Management expects to report top-line data from this study in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Arikayce is currently the only marketed drug in the company&rsquo;s portfolio. The drug is currently approved under the accelerated pathway for treating a limited patient population &mdash; refractory MAC lung disease in adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If the ENCORE study is successful, it could help Insmed significantly expand the drug&rsquo;s patient population and also convert the accelerated approval to a full one. Management estimates the total addressable market (TAM) for refractory MAC to be around 30,000 patients in the United States, Europe and Japan. If the drug were also approved in the newly-infected patient population, the TAM would increase to around 275,000 patients in the combined three markets. Based on these factors, management expects Arikayce to generate more than a billion dollars in peak sales.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Our Take on INSM</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Compared with other stocks in the biotech space, Insmed&rsquo;s pipeline shows promise. It also has a regular stream of income thanks to Arikayce sales, which puts less strain on the company&rsquo;s accumulated cash balance of around $1.25 billion (as of June 2024-end). The company also has a significant first-mover advantage in the bronchiectasis space &mdash; a market with vast commercial potential. Given the success obtained by Insmed in pipeline development, it could also be eyed as an attractive acquisition target by big pharma.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">INSM Zacks Rank</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Insmed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2>Insmed, Inc. Price</h2><p>&nbsp;</p> <img alt="Insmed, Inc. Price" height="251" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/5f/1724763273.png" title="" width="538" /> <p>Insmed, Inc. price | Insmed, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Our Key Picks Among Biotech Stocks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A couple of better-ranked stocks include <strong>Bioventus </strong>BVS and <strong>Fulcrum Therapeutics </strong>FULC, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, estimates for Bioventus&rsquo; 2024 earnings per share have risen from 27 cents to 40 cents. Estimates for 2025 have increased from 43 cents to 45 cents during the same period. Year to date, shares of Bioventus have surged 89.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BVS&rsquo; earnings beat estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed the mark on one occasion. Bioventus delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 102.86%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, estimates for Fulcrum Therapeutics&rsquo; 2024 loss per share have improved from $1.24 to 48 cents. Estimates for 2025 have improved from $1.71 to $1.51 during the same period. Year to date, Fulcrum Therapeutics&rsquo; shares have rallied 44.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Earnings of Fulcrum Therapeutics beat estimates in each of the last four quarters. Fulcrum delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 393.18%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327841/insmed-stock-surges-168-in-the-past-six-months-here-s-why?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|price_surge_/_plunge-2327841">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ AVGO Expands Cloud Portfolio: Should You Buy, Hold or Sell the Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Broadcom</strong> AVGO shares have returned 43% year to date,&nbsp; outperforming the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry&rsquo;s growth of 26.2% in the same time period. The outperformance reflects investors&rsquo; confidence in the AVGO stock, considering the company&rsquo;s sustained focus on enhancing cloud offerings, which is helping it win new clients.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, Broadcom launched a new private cloud offering in collaboration with Hitachi Vantara.&nbsp; The co-engineered solution has been developed by integrating Vantara&rsquo;s Unified Compute Platform RS and Broadcom&rsquo;s VMware Cloud Foundation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This new private cloud offering is expected to be adopted by organizations that want to minimize the costs of owning a native cloud ecosystem. Companies that want to reduce the complex operations in hybrid and multi-cloud are also likely to adopt the solution.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">By outsourcing the cloud requirements, organizations will be able to leverage Broadcom-owned VMware&rsquo;s proven cloud infrastructure and scale per their requirement without the hassles of owning their own cloud infrastructure.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The solution will also enable organizations with leading automation offerings and software-defined services. Alongside all these features, the offering also delivers flexibility in deployment, simplification in management and sustainability in operations.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Broadcom Inc. Price and Consensus</h3><h2> <img alt="Broadcom Inc. Price and Consensus" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/6c/1724767299.png" style="width: 610px; height: 277px;" title="" /> </h2><p>Broadcom Inc. price-consensus-chart | Broadcom Inc. Quote</p></div><h2>How Deep is AVGO&rsquo;s Existing Cloud Expertise?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Broadcom expanded its hybrid cloud portfolio with the acquisition of VMware in 2023. The acquisition benefited AVGO by accelerating app delivery, enabling zero-trust security and delivering software-defined services to its customers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Alongside VMware hybrid cloud, AVGO has been offering Symantec Enterprise Cloud for a long time. The Symantec Enterprise Cloud is used by industry leaders for data-centric hybrid security. Broadcom also partnered with <strong>Alphabet</strong>&rsquo;s GOOGL Google Cloud to align their solutions so mutual customers can benefit from these offerings.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Together with Alphabet&rsquo;s Google Cloud, Broadcom has ensured network solution integrations and simplification of migration from VMware Cloud Foundation to Google Cloud VMware Engine.<br /><br />Alongside these milestones, AVGO has also broadened its Advantage Partner Program for VMware Cloud Service providers. The program enables cloud service partners to offer sovereign cloud services with high compliance and data residency for a consistent cloud experience across various environments. This initiative has enabled Broadcom to comply with the European public policy goals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Broadcom is also focusing on shifting VMware products to a subscription-based model. AVGO has signed up approximately 3,000 customers to develop its own virtual private cloud on-premise infrastructure, which boosted Broadcom-owned VMware&rsquo;s Annualized Booking Value. This step increased VMware&rsquo;s annualized booking revenues from $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2024 to $1.9 billion in the second quarter.</p><h2>Increasing Competition Remains a Concern</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the cloud computing market is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 16.4% from 2024 to 2029. The high growth potential has made this market highly fragmented and competitive.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Google Cloud, <strong>Amazon</strong>&rsquo;s AMZN Amazon Web Services and <strong>Microsoft</strong>&rsquo;s MSFT Azure are the leaders in the cloud computing space. Competition from these well-settled players are putting pricing pressure that could negatively impact Broadcom&rsquo;s margins.</p><h2>What Investors Should Do With AVGO Stock</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Broadcom&rsquo;s strong portfolio, along with an expanding partner base, surely reflects solid top-line growth potential over the long run. However, AVGO stock is not so cheap, as the Value Style Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, Broadcom&rsquo;s shares are trading at 12.84X, higher than its median of 11.41X and the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry&rsquo;s 6.37X.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Broadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327763/avgo-expands-cloud-portfolio-should-you-buy-hold-or-sell-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_tech_sector-2327763">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abbott</strong>&rsquo;s ABT diversified business portfolio is well-positioned to drive continued momentum in 2024. However, Abbott is facing a challenging business environment globally. ABT currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Abbott continues to expand its Diagnostics business foothold (consisting of 21.2% of the total revenues in the second quarter of 2024). Over the past few quarters, the company has witnessed increased demand for routine diagnostics (excluding COVID-19 testing sales), particularly in the United States and internationally.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company is particularly gaining from the strong adoption of its market-leading systems and demand for testing that takes place in a variety of settings, including hospitals, laboratories, urgent care centers, physician offices, retail pharmacies and blood screening facilities.<br /><br />Within Abbott&rsquo;s Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD) business, its unique branded generics model has been built to focus specifically on key emerging countries where long-term growth in medicines is guaranteed by favorable demographic trends, including increasing populations, growing middle classes, aging populations with the related rise in chronic diseases and an increasing focus on expanding access to healthcare. The year 2023 marked the third consecutive year of double-digit organic sales growth within EPD. Abbott&rsquo;s EPD sales in the second quarter of 2024 increased 8.1% organically.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further, Abbott&rsquo;s Diabetes Care business continues to benefit from the growing sales of its flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. In a relatively short span, FreeStyle Libre has achieved global leadership among continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for both Type 1 and Type 2 users.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Abbott Laboratories Price</h3> <img alt="Abbott Laboratories Price" height="251" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/b8/1724764003.png" title="" width="544" /> <p>Abbott Laboratories price | Abbott Laboratories Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">On the flip side, the challenging macroeconomic scenario in the form of the ongoing complex geo-political situation globally, specifically where Abbott operates, is driving higher-than-anticipated increases in expenses in terms of raw materials and freight. These could also result in broader economic impacts and security concerns, affecting the company&rsquo;s business in the upcoming months. Industrywide, it has been seen that the deteriorating global economic environment is reducing demand for several MedTech products, resulting in lower sales and lower product prices while increasing the cost of goods and operating expenses of the businesses of the MedTech companies.<br /><br />In the second quarter, Abbott incurred a 2.7% increase in the cost of products sold (excluding amortization expense). Selling, general and administration expenses were up 7.2% year over year resulting in a mere 18-bps improvement in operating margin to 20.6%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further, following the official ending of the public health emergency in May 2023, Abbott is experiencing a continuous decline in COVID testing-related demand. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales decreased 19.8% organically in the second quarter of 2024 due to the lower demand for COVID-19 tests. Within Molecular Diagnostics too, organic sales fell 9.4% year over year.<br /><br />In the upcoming months, too, this year-over-year decline in testing demand is expected to mar Abbott&rsquo;s overall Diagnostics business sales growth.</p><h2>Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are <strong>Exact Sciences </strong>EXAS, <strong>Boston Scientific </strong>BSX and <strong>SiBone</strong> SIBN.

<![CDATA[ D.R. Horton Hits 52-Week High: Can Rate-Cut Buzz Lift the Stock? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>D.R. Horton, Inc.</strong> DHI shares crafted a new 52-week high of $193.63 on Aug. 6, 2024. The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $189.06.<br /><br />Homebuilder stocks such as <strong>KB Home</strong> KBH, <strong>PulteGroup, Inc.</strong> PHM and <strong>Lennar Corporation</strong> LEN reached 52-week highs on Aug. 26, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell&#39;s clear signal to financial markets that the time for lower interest rates has arrived. While Powell suggested that rate cuts are on the horizon, the extent of these cuts is still uncertain.<br /><br />Among the prominent names in the homebuilding industry, D.R. Horton &mdash; the Arlington, TX-based company &mdash; has been reaping the benefits of its improved construction cycle times, industry-leading market share, solid acquisition strategy, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands and price points.<br /><br />In the past three months, DHI has seen its shares rise steadily, growing as much as 32.4% compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry&rsquo;s rise of 24.1%. The stock has fared better than the Zacks Construction sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index&rsquo;s 9.6% and 5.8% rallies, respectively.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">DHI&rsquo;s 3-Month Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/0d/75551.jpg?v=736590965" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: center;">DHI Stock Trades Above 50 and 200-Day Moving Averages</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">DHI currently trades above the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages.<br />&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8b/75553.jpg?v=198510156" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">With DHI&rsquo;s stock price experiencing a significant surge, investors face a crucial decision: should they buy, hold or sell their shares now?</p><h2>Let&#39;s Delve Into the DHI Stock&#39;s Underlying Fundamentals</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improved Construction Cycle Times of D.R. Horton</strong><br /><br />In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, D.R. Horton&#39;s average construction cycle times have improved and are back to normal levels, even slightly below their historical averages. This improvement in cycle times has been a contributing factor to more efficient housing inventory management and faster housing turns, allowing the company to manage its homes and inventory more effectively. The improved cycle times allow for quicker sales and inventory turnover, which can lead to better financial performance.<br /><br /><strong> DHI&rsquo;s Growth &amp; Market Share, Product Diversification</strong><br /><br />D.R. Horton has significantly expanded its market share in the U.S. housing market. The company closed 94,255 homes in the TTM ending June 30, 2024 compared to 90,777 in 2023. The number of homes closed has grown substantially over the years, from 1,231 homes in 1992 to 90,777 homes in 2023, illustrating long-term growth. D.R. Horton is the largest homebuilder in three of the top five U.S. housing markets &mdash; Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW), Houston and Austin. This dominance underscores the company&rsquo;s strong competitive positioning in highly populated and fast-growing areas.<br /><br />D.R. Horton caters to a wide range of buyers, including entry-level, move-up, active adult and luxury segments. This diversification allows the company to capture a broad customer base. Again, the company&rsquo;s focus on affordability is evident as 69% of the homes closed in the past year were priced below $400,000. This strategy not only broadens the potential customer base but also positions DHI well in the face of economic uncertainties where affordability becomes a key consideration for buyers.<br /><br /><strong> Boost in DHI&rsquo;s Capital Return Momentum</strong><br /><br />During the fiscal third-quarter earnings call, D.R. Horton emphasizes its strong cash flow position, driven by improved operational efficiency, particularly through reduced construction cycle times and better inventory management. Over the past five fiscal years, D.R. Horton has demonstrated strong cash flow generation from its homebuilding operations, with a total of $9.6 billion accumulated between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2023. The cash flow figures reveal a steady growth trajectory, starting at $1,453 million in fiscal 2019 and peaking at $3,078 million in fiscal 2023.<br /><br />D.R. Horton has strategically allocated this cash flow across several key areas, reflecting its commitment to enhancing shareholder value and strengthening its financial position. Of the $9.6 billion in cash flow, $5.4 billion &mdash; approximately 60% &mdash; has been returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This substantial return of capital underscores the company&#39;s focus on rewarding its investors. Additionally, $2.1 billion has been directed toward reducing homebuilding debt and increasing liquidity, further solidifying the company&#39;s financial stability.<br /><br />In terms of growth initiatives, D.R. Horton has invested $1.3 billion in rental operations, aligning with the growing demand for rental properties. The company has also allocated $0.8 billion toward acquisitions, which likely supports its expansion and diversification efforts. D.R. Horton anticipates an increase in the return of capital to shareholders in fiscal 2025 and beyond, signaling confidence in its ongoing financial performance and operational success.<br /><br /><strong> DHI&rsquo;s Accretive Acquisitions &amp; Higher Land Investment</strong><br /><br />The company&#39;s acquisition strategy is focused on small, strategic &quot;tuck-in&quot; acquisitions. These acquisitions are intended to expand D.R. Horton&rsquo;s footprint in emerging geographies or enhance its existing operations in key markets. In July 2023, the company acquired the homebuilding operations of Truland Homes, which operates in Baldwin County, Alabama and Northwest Florida, for approximately $100 million in cash. The acquired assets include nearly about 155 homes in inventory, 620 lots and a sales order backlog of 55 homes, along with approximately 660 additional lots through land purchase contracts.<br /><br />The company prefers to acquire businesses that come with both a strong lot position and experienced personnel. Additionally, D.R. Horton often works with the selling principals to transition them into lot entitlement and development roles, which supports ongoing growth and strengthens relationships with local land development partners.<br /><br />In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the company&rsquo;s homebuilding investments in lots, land and development added up to $2.5 billion, up 4.2% sequentially and 13.6% year over year, respectively. The investments included $1.4 billion per finished lot, $750 million for land development and $340 million for land acquisition. During the fiscal third quarter, the average number of active selling communities increased 3% sequentially and 12% year over year, respectively.</p><h2>What May Pull Back D.R. Horton?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Volatile Market Conditions for DHI</strong><br /><br />From the industry perspective, high borrowing costs are currently hindering home sales and builder sentiment, creating a challenging environment for housing investments. Affordability issues, driven by high inflation and mortgage rates, limit the potential for higher sales growth.<br /><br />The declining backlog of orders &mdash; a leading indicator of future revenue &mdash; further suggests that DHI may continue to face revenue pressures in the coming quarters. D.R. Horton witnessed a 12% year-over-year decline in the order backlog to 16,792 homes at the end of the fiscal third quarter. Moreover, the value of the backlog was down 12% from the prior year to $6.6 billion.<br /><br />The Federal Reserve may reduce interest rates later this year, potentially stimulating housing demand. However, the timing and scale of these possible rate cuts are unclear. Without a noticeable and significant decline in interest rates, a major recovery in housing demand appears unlikely. This uncertainty introduces an additional risk for investors considering an investment in DHI.<br /><br /><strong> D.R. Horton&rsquo;s Cost Pressures</strong><br /><br />Continued elevated incentives necessary to address affordability, affecting gross margins despite improvements. Homebuilding SG&amp;A expenses increased by 12% year over year in the last reported quarter, reflecting the expansion of operations and potentially squeezing profit margins.<br /><br />Increasing lot costs, which rose by 2.5% sequentially and continued to be a headwind, impacting overall profitability. While stick and brick costs have stabilized, lot costs continue to rise, and the overall cost environment remains uncertain, particularly if demand pressures lead to increased incentives.</p><h2>DHI Stock Looks Pricey</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">DHI stock is trading at a premium, with a forward 12-month P/E of 12.4X compared with the industry&rsquo;s 11.8X and higher than the median of 9.9X, reflecting a stretched valuation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/74/75554.jpg?v=390673043" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Downward Estimate Revision Trend for DHI</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Analysts are showing reduced confidence in the stock, as indicated by recent downward revisions in earnings estimates. Over the last 30 days, forecasts for the current quarter and fiscal 2024 have declined to $4.14 (from $4.16) and to $14.03 (from $14.04), respectively. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DHI&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings per share has risen to $15.39 from $15.37 in the last 30 days, indicating analysts&rsquo; increasing confidence in the stock for the next year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/60/75552.jpg?v=464167719" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Investment Thought for DHI: Hold or Fold?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">D.R. Horton is well-positioned due to its strong acquisition strategies, expanding homebuilding lots, reduced cycle times, and a diverse range of product offerings across multiple brands and price points.<br /><br />While DHI has recently hit new highs in its stock performance, prospective investors should exercise caution. The Federal Reserve is expected to begin lowering interest rates in September in response to declining inflation and a cooling job market. Although these cuts might be viewed positively, they are unlikely to have an immediate, significant impact on businesses.<br /><br />While small reductions in the federal funds rate are expected in the future, they are unlikely to drastically change loan repayment terms or significantly boost the housing market in the short term. Given the stock&#39;s high valuation in a challenging macroeconomic environment, downward revisions in EPS estimates and cost pressures, current stakeholders should maintain their position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Potential new investors might consider waiting for more clarity on how DHI handles these challenges and navigates the broader economic landscape before making new investment decisions.

<![CDATA[ 3 Equity REIT Stocks Worth Investing in as the Industry Rebounds ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ The REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry is likely to benefit from the resilience and strong fundamentals of a number of asset categories. Healthy trends in healthcare real estate, advertising space and selective rebound in the office category poise players like <strong>Healthpeak Properties, Inc.</strong> DOC, <strong>Lamar Advertising Company</strong> LAMR and <strong>Cousins Properties Incorporated</strong> CUZ well for growth. Moreover, the recent expectations regarding the interest rate cut have renewed enthusiasm in the REITs.<br /><br />However, geopolitical unrest and choppiness in the macroeconomic environment remain a concern, and customers are prioritizing cost management and delaying leasing decisions for certain asset categories.<br /><p><b>About the Industry</b></p><p>The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other sector comprises a diverse collection of REIT stocks representing various asset categories, including industrial, office, lodging, healthcare, self-storage, data centers, infrastructures and more. Equity REITs lease out space within these properties to tenants, generating income through rental payments. Economic growth assumes a central role within the real estate sector as economic expansion directly correlates with higher demand for real estate, increased occupancy rates and greater bargaining power for landlords to command higher rental rates. Moreover, the performance of Equity REITs hinges on the specific dynamics of their underlying assets and the geographic location of their properties. It is imperative to thoroughly explore the fundamentals of these asset categories before making any investment decisions.</p><p><b>What's Shaping the Future of the REIT and Equity Trust - Other Industry?</b></p><p><em><strong>Resilient Demand Across Various Asset Classes Drives Growth Potential:</strong></em> The demand for several asset categories is expected to stay healthy in the near to mid-term. The projected increase in the senior citizen population, along with a rise in healthcare spending within this age group and restricted supply, suggests a positive outlook for healthcare REITs. Further, in today&#39;s digital era, there is a strong demand for data center space as businesses and service providers increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence into their strategies and drive their digital transformation initiatives, boosting growth prospects for data center REITs. For industrial real estate, even though rent growth is slowing, healthy demand is likely to keep this asset type in limelight. Meanwhile, in the office real estate sector, despite the impact of hybrid work arrangements on overall demand, there is a growing tenant preference for premium office spaces with superior amenities.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em><strong>Interest Rate Cut Expectations Boost Attractiveness:</strong></em> The recent indications of a rate cut in the September FOMC meeting are likely to raise the attractiveness of the REITs. Any rate cut, even a slight one, is good news for the rate-sensitive REIT industry because REITs&rsquo; dependence on debt for business keeps investors optimistic about their performances in a rate-cut environment as the companies benefit from lower borrowing costs. Moreover, low interest rates contribute to higher valuations. Also, their dividend yield grabs investors&rsquo; attention more than yields on fixed-income and money market accounts in times like these.<br /><br /><em><strong>Economic Choppiness to Hamper Near-Term Activity:</strong></em> Despite the positive trends, concerns persist about the impact of slower economic growth on commercial real estate activity. Geopolitical uncertainties add to these challenges. In this environment, customers are focused on cost control and are delaying leasing decisions, showing reduced urgency in making new commitments while waiting for further price discovery. By asset category, industrial real estate demand is being impacted. For office space, leasing activity is likely to continue to be affected by hybrid work arrangements and uncertainty in the broader business climate. In the self-storage sector, new customer price sensitivity and lower new customer rates are likely to create headwinds for these REITs in the near term. For Tower REITs, demand is expected to soften in the coming quarters due to reduced carrier capital expenditures and the churn effect, which could hurt profitability.</p><p><b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects</b></p><p>The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry is housed within the broader Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it in the top 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.<br /><br />The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates robust near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.<br /><br />The industry&rsquo;s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the northward revision of funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group&rsquo;s growth potential of late.<br /><br />Before we present a few stocks that you might want to consider for your portfolio, let&rsquo;s take a look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.</p><p><b>Industry Lags the Stock Market Performance</b></p><p>The REIT and Equity Trust - Other Industry has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Finance sector in a year.<br /><br />The industry has risen 18.1% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s increase of 27% and the broader Finance sector&rsquo;s 27.9% jump.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One-Year Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/reit_others_price performance_20240827.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 207px;" /></p><p><b>Industry's Current Valuation</b></p><p>On the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-FFO ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing REIT - Others, we see that the industry is currently trading at 16.62X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 21.72X. The industry is trading above the Finance sector&rsquo;s forward 12-month P/E of 16.03X. This is shown in the chart below.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Forward 12 Month Price-to-FFO (P/FFO) Ratio</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/reit_others_spvaluation_20240827.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 132px;" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/reit_others_finvaluation_20240827.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 126px;" /></p><p>Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 22.13X and as low as 12.81X, with a median of 17.80X.</p><p><b>3 REIT and Equity Trust - Other Stocks to Buy </b></p><p><strong>Healthpeak Properties:</strong> Headquartered in Denver, CO, Healthpeak Properties has a diversified portfolio of high-quality healthcare properties across three core asset classes of outpatient medical, lab and continuing care retirement community real estate. The REIT&rsquo;s top-quality healthcare real estate assets are positioned in the high-barrier-to-entry markets of the United States.</p><p>Solid demand for lab assets amid the increasing need for drug innovation and developments is likely to drive its lab portfolio&rsquo;s growth. DOC is also poised to benefit from the rising senior citizens population and their high healthcare spending trends.</p><p>Its merger with Physicians Realty also has increased opportunities for internal and external growth. Encouraging capital-recycling moves and a healthy balance sheet bode well for long-term growth.<br /><br />DOC currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s 2024 revenues calls for a 23.7% increase year over year. The consensus mark for 2024 FFO per share has also been raised over the past three months to $1.79. The stock has risen 18.9% in the past three months. <span style="pd4ml-display: none; pd4ml-visibility: hidden;"> You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>. </span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/doc_20240827.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 264px;" /></p><p><br /><strong>Lamar Advertising Company:</strong> This REIT is one of the largest owners and operators of outdoor advertising structures in the United States. The impressive footprint of outdoor advertising assets, the unmatched logo sign business, a diversified tenant base across various sectors and a focus on local businesses are tailwinds for Lamar.</p><p>Efforts to expand the digital platform and technological advancements in the low-cost, out-of-home advertising platform bode well for long-term growth.<br /><br />Lamar currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LAMR&rsquo;s 2024 FFO per share has been raised six cents over the past month to $8.09.</p><p>Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 FFO per share has also moved up three cents over the same period. The stock has appreciated 12.7% in the past six months.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/lamr_20240827.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 246px;" /></p><p><br /><strong>Cousins Properties:</strong> This Atlanta, GA-based office REIT has an unmatched portfolio of Class A office assets concentrated in the high-growth Sun Belt markets. This region is experiencing a population influx. Amid favorable migration trends and a pro-business environment, corporate relocations and expansions in the Sun Belt markets have gained pace, and this is driving the demand for office space.</p><p>It is seeing a recovery in demand for its high-quality, well-placed office properties, as highlighted by a rebound in new leasing volume.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Assurant, Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s AIZ shares have rallied 39.3% in a year compared with the industry&#39;s growth of 26.4%. The Finance sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 index have returned 27.9% and 27.1% in the said time frame, respectively. With a market capitalization of $9.98 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.3 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b2/75514.jpg?v=863768615" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The rally was largely driven by the well-performing Global Lifestyle business, growth of fee-based capital-light businesses, solid capital management, favorable estimates and effective capital deployment.<br /><br />This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) multi-line insurer delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 33.56%. The multi-line insurer&rsquo;s return on equity (ROE) of 19.6% improved 590 basis points year over year. The figure is better than the industry average of 16.3%. ROE is a measure reflecting how efficiently a company utilizes shareholders&rsquo; money.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Assurant&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings has moved 2.9% and 4.5% north, respectively, in the past 30 days, reflecting analysts&rsquo; optimism.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Will the Bull Run Continue?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Assurant&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share indicates a year-over-year increase of 6.7%. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $11.74 billion, implying a year-over-year improvement of 4.8%. The consensus estimate for 2025 earnings per share and revenues indicates a year-over-year increase of 6.1% and 3.1%, respectively, from the corresponding 2024 estimates. Earnings have improved 20.2% in the past five years, better than the industry average of 9%.<br /><br />Assurant&rsquo;s focus on growing fee-based capital-light businesses that presently constitute 52% of segmental revenues bodes well for growth. Management estimates that contribution from the same will continue to grow in double digits over the longer term.<br /><br />Better performance in Homeowners reflecting higher lender-placed net earned premiums should drive better results at Global Housing. At the same time, growth across Connected Living and Global Automotive should drive Global Lifestyle.<br /><br />The insurer remains focused on ramping up the Connected Living platform, deploying innovative products and services, and adding new partnerships. These initiatives are expected to double the margins of Connected Living to 8% over the long term.<br /><br />Investment income, which has been witnessing an increase in net investment income over the past few years, should benefit from higher yields on fixed-maturity securities.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Style Score</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The insurer has a VGM Score of B. The VGM Score helps identify stocks with the most attractive value, best growth and the most promising momentum.<br />Back-tested results show that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Attractive Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AIZ shares are trading at a price-to-book value multiple of 2, lower than the industry average of 2.7. It also has an impressive Value Score of A. This style score helps find the most attractive value stocks.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Prudent Capital Deployment</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">AIZ has a solid capital management policy in place. The insurer has been increasing dividends for the last 19 straight years. Assurant expects to be on the high-end of $200 million to $300 million share repurchases range for 2024. Notably, its free cash flow conversion has remained more than 100% over the last many quarters, reflecting its solid earnings.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other top-ranked stocks from the multi-line insurance industry are <strong>Radian Group Inc. </strong>RDN, <strong>Old Republic International Corporation</strong> ORI and <strong>EverQuote, Inc</strong>. EVER, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.<br /><br />Radian Group has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 21.3%. In the past year, shares of RDN have jumped 33%.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RDN&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 revenues implies year-over-year growth of 6.2% and 5.5%, respectively.<br /><br />Old Republic International has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing in one, the average being 9%. In the past year, shares of ORI have climbed 29.2%.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORI&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 7.6% and 4.4%, respectively.<br /><br />EverQuote has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 144.9%. In the past year, shares of EVER have rallied 315.6%.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EVER&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 137% and 43.8%, respectively.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327842/assurant-stock-rises-39-3-in-a-year-more-room-for-growth?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|price_surge_/_plunge-2327842">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ What's in Store for NVIDIA ETFs in Q2 Earnings? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>AI leader NVIDIA NVDA is set to release its fiscal second-quarter 2025 results after the market&rsquo;s close on Aug. 28. The chipmaker has risen 18.7% over the past three months, outperforming the industry&rsquo;s growth of 14.9%. The strong trend will continue if NVIDIA beats earnings estimates.&nbsp;<br /><br />ETFs having the largest allocation to NVIDIA will be in focus ahead of its earnings report. These include <strong>Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF</strong> SHOC, <strong>VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF</strong> SMH, T<strong>echnology Select Sector SPDR Fund </strong>XLK, <strong>Grizzle Growth ETF</strong> DARP and <strong>TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF</strong> LRNZ.</p><h2>Earnings Whispers</h2><p>NVIDIA currently has an Earnings ESP of -2.25% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />The world&rsquo;s largest chipmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. However, NVIDIA is expected to post triple-digit earnings (33.3%) and revenue (109%) growth for the to-be-reported quarter. NVIDIA&rsquo;s earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 18.43%, on average, in the last four quarters (read: Here&#39;s How You Can Play NVIDIA&#39;s Earnings).</p><h2>Analysts&rsquo; View on NVDA Stock</h2><p>Many analysts are bullish on the stock ahead of NVIDIA&rsquo;s earnings release. Wedbush expects the chipmaker to deliver another &ldquo;drop the mic performance,&rdquo; citing signs of &quot;massive enterprise AI demand&quot; and spending by cloud giants such as Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet&#39;s Google (GOOGL), all trends that would benefit the chipmaker. Analysts from Raymond James and KeyBanc also stated they expect a strong quarter from the chipmaker despite concerns about a reported delay in NVIDIA&rsquo;s Blackwell AI chip.<br /><br />NVIDIA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.20 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 40 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.25 a month ago based on 40 recommendations. Of the 40 recommendations, 35 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy account for 87.5% and 5%, respectively, compared to 85% and 5% a month ago.<br /><br />Based on short-term price targets offered by 40 analysts, the average price target for NVIDIA comes to $141.90. The forecasts range from a low of $90.00 to a high of $200.00.</p><h2>Data Center Growth Seems Solid</h2><p>NVIDIA has been at the forefront of technology companies&#39; race to build AI into their products and services. Its success is largely attributed to its leadership in developing advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including generative AI, the technology backing OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media.&nbsp;<br /><br />Major cloud service providers rely on NVIDIA&rsquo;s GPUs to train and run AI applications. The company&rsquo;s clients include around 20,000 start-ups, along with big names like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. The company holds an 80% market share in AI chips for data centers (read: Are Semiconductor ETFs Better Bets on AI Boom Than Big Techs?).&nbsp;<br /><br />Demand for NVIDIA&rsquo;s H100 accelerators has been on a surge. Its next-generation GPU chip is expected to drive another round of massive growth. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the graphics chipmaker expects revenues of around $28 billion, plus or minus 2%.<br /><br />Meanwhile, investors will be keen on watching updates on Blackwell chips, which have been rumored to be delayed by up to three months or more.</p><h2>NVIDIA&rsquo;s Valuation</h2><p>NVDA&rsquo;s expensive valuation has been a cause for concern in recent months. But given the astounding surge the stock has enjoyed since the end of 2022, its valuation does not seem overstretched. NVIDIA is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 49.8 versus 53.58 for the industry.<br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/41/75584.jpg?v=13123874" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Further, the stock is currently trading at a PEG ratio of 1.25, much lower than the industry average of 4.13, suggesting that it is a better value stock in the industry. The lower the PEG ratio, the better the value, as investors would be paying less for each unit of earnings.</p><h2>ETFs in Focus</h2><p><strong>Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (SHOC)</strong> &ndash; NVIDIA occupies the top position with 29.5% of assets (read: Semiconductor ETFs Bear the Brunt of Market Rout).&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH)</strong> - NVIDIA is the top firm, accounting for 21.9% share. &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)</strong> - NVIDIA occupies the top position with a 21.3% share in the basket.<br /><br /><strong>Grizzle Growth ETF (DARP)</strong> - NVIDIA occupies the top position with 20.3% of the assets.<br /><br /><strong>TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF (LRNZ)</strong> - NVIDIA takes the top spot at 14.9% share.</p><h2>Single Stock ETFs</h2><p><strong>T-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF (NVDX)</strong> &ndash; NVIDIA exposure: 200%<br /><br /><strong>GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL)</strong> &ndash; NVIDIA exposure: 200%</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327773/what-s-in-store-for-nvidia-etfs-in-q2-earnings?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2327773">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Papa John&rsquo;s International, Inc.</strong> PZZA will likely benefit from digital initiatives, menu innovation and unit-expansion efforts. This and the emphasis on strategic refranchising bode well. However, a challenging macro environment and soft comps are a headwind.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s delve deeper.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Strategic Efforts Aid PZZA&rsquo;s Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Innovation and Digital Enhancements:</strong> Innovation remains key to Papa John&rsquo;s strategy. The company is expanding its pipeline of differentiated menu offerings, designed to boost customer satisfaction and enhance brand loyalty. Investments in digital platforms are expected to drive higher conversion rates and repeat transactions. The recent app update and improvements in the loyalty program are already showing promising results, with enhanced user experience and streamlined customer journeys.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improving PZZA&rsquo;s Value Perception:</strong> Papa John&#39;s is realigning its marketing and product offerings to better cater to value-conscious consumers. Initiatives such as the launch of the $9.99 cheeseburger pizza and the $10.99 extra-large New York-style pizza have begun to improve the brand&#39;s value perception. It is also testing various value offers in certain markets to identify opportunities that are likely to drive growth in restaurant-level profits.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>International Growth and Transformation:</strong> On the international front, the company is making significant strides in optimizing its operations, particularly in the U.K. It closed 43 underperforming restaurants and refranchised 60, leaving 13 company-owned locations in the U.K. This strategic refranchising is expected to make the U.K. market profitable in the second half of 2024. It is executing a global marketing campaign, &lsquo;Better Get You Some,&rsquo; which already started to yield positive results across various regional hubs.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">PZZA Headwinds: Dismal Price &amp; Comps Performance</h2><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6c/75539.jpg?v=1748170985" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Stock Performance:</strong> Year to date, shares of Papa John&#39;s have declined 36.3% against the industry&rsquo;s rise of 0.2%. Softer sales trends driven by macroeconomic pressures and shifts in consumer spending primarily caused the downside.<br /><br /><strong>Dismal Comps Hurt Papa John&#39;s:</strong> In the second quarter, total comparable sales declined 2.7% year over year compared with a 1.3% fall reported in the prior-year quarter. Domestic company-owned restaurant comps in the quarter fell 4.2% year over year compared with 2.2% growth reported in the year-ago quarter. At North America franchised restaurants, comps fell 3.4% year over year against a 2.3% decline reported in the year-ago quarter. Comps growth at North America restaurants declined 3.6% year over year. The downside was primarily caused by lower transactions attributable to a decline in its organic delivery and a lower estimated year-over-year shift in channel mix.<br /><br />PZZA anticipates the trend to continue on account of ongoing economic challenges and weakening consumer confidence. The company adjusted its full-year guidance to reflect this cautious outlook, anticipating North America&#39;s comparable sales to range from flat to a slight decline for the entirety of 2024.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Time to Keep an Eye on PZZA Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite near-term challenges, Papa John&rsquo;s is strategically positioning itself for long-term success. Its focus on enhancing value perception, driving innovation, optimizing digital channels and improving international operations provides a solid foundation for growth. Investors should consider retaining PZZA stock as the company navigates this transitional phase. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) justifies our thesis.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector include:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Texas Roadhouse, Inc.</strong> TXRH sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 0.4%, on average. TXRH&rsquo;s shares have risen 62.3% in the past year. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXRH&rsquo;s 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) indicates 15.6% and 39.2% growth, respectively, from the year-earlier actuals.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Wingstop Inc.</strong> WING carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 21.8%, on average. The stock has surged 148.2% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WING&rsquo;s 2024 sales and EPS suggests a rise of 36% and 51.2%, respectively, from the year-ago levels.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc.</strong> LOCO carries a Zacks Rank #2. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 21.6%, on average. LOCO&rsquo;s shares have risen 42.6% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LOCO&rsquo;s 2025 sales and EPS indicates 2% and 12.7% growth, respectively, from the prior-year figures.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327807/here-s-why-you-should-retain-papa-john-s-stock-in-your-portfolio?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2327807">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Verano Expands U.S. Cannabis Footprint With New Buyouts ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Verano Holdings Corp.</strong> VRNOF, a leading multi-state cannabis operator, has solidified its presence in the U.S. cannabis market by completing the acquisition of three subsidiaries from The Cannabist Company Holdings Inc. This strategic move includes two subsidiaries in Arizona (203 Organix, L.L.C. and Salubrious Wellness Center, Inc.) and the third one in Virginia (Columbia Care Eastern Virginia LLC.), enhancing Verano&rsquo;s market footprint in key regions and positioning the company for significant growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The acquisition deal was initiated on July 29. This deal helps Verano foray into the Virginia market, ahead of the Adult Use Program launch. It will deepen the company&rsquo;s footprint in Arizona.</p><h2>Verano Enters Virginia Market</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Verano&#39;s acquisition of Columbia Care Eastern Virginia LLC marks a significant milestone in its expansion strategy. By becoming the sole vertical cannabis operator in Health Service Area 5 (HSA 5) of Eastern Virginia, Verano gains exclusive access to a market with nearly two million residents and a thriving tourism industry. This acquisition includes an active cultivation and production facility, along with six operational dispensaries in major cities like Hampton, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Virginia&rsquo;s cannabis program is uniquely structured, allowing only one operator per health service area. This exclusivity not only limits competition but also provides Verano with the opportunity to establish a dominant presence in the state, especially as the market prepares for the potential legalization of adult-use cannabis. The addition of delivery services and wholesale opportunities across the Commonwealth further enhances Verano&rsquo;s capacity to serve a broader customer base, setting the stage for future growth.</p><h2>VRNOF Strengthens Operations in Arizona</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In Arizona, Verano&rsquo;s acquisition of 203 Organix, L.L.C. and Salubrious Wellness Center, Inc. significantly boosts its operational capabilities. With this deal, Verano&rsquo;s retail footprint expands to eight locations, including new dispensaries in Tempe and Prescott. This complements its existing Zen Leaf dispensaries and multiple cultivation and processing facilities, enabling the company to meet growing consumer demand and strengthen its position in the Arizona market.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/8f/75540.jpg?v=1136376635" style="height: 200px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The addition of these assets in Arizona not only increases Verano&rsquo;s cultivation capacity but also enhances its ability to deliver a diverse range of cannabis products. The expanded retail presence, coupled with high-performing dispensaries in strategic locations, aligns with Verano&rsquo;s goal of broadening access to its award-winning brand portfolio.</p><h2>Veranos&#39; Strategic Growth and Future Outlook</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Verano&rsquo;s strategic acquisitions in Virginia and Arizona are pivotal to its long-term growth plans. By consolidating its market presence in these states, Verano is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities, particularly the anticipated shift toward adult-use cannabis in Virginia. The company&rsquo;s ability to integrate and optimize these new operations reflects its commitment to maintaining a top-tier status in the competitive cannabis industry.</p><h2>Veranos Aided by Cannabis Market Prospects</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Going by a Fortune Business Insights report, the global cannabis market is experiencing explosive growth. It is projected to grow from $57.18 billion in 2023 to $444.34 billion by 2030, at a staggering CAGR of 34.03%. This surge will be driven by increasing legalization and recognition of cannabis&#39; medicinal and therapeutic benefits worldwide.</p><h2>VRNOF Stock Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date, shares of VRNOF have plunged 14.1% against the industry&rsquo;s 10.5% growth.</p><h2>Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Veranos stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are <strong>Exact Sciences </strong>EXAS, <strong>Boston Scientific </strong>BSX and <strong>SiBone</strong> SIBN.

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hillman Solutions Corp.</strong>&#39;s HLMN subsidiary, Big Time Products, LLC, acquired Intex DIY, Inc., a supplier of wiping cloths and cleaning textiles. This marks the company&rsquo;s second acquisition in 2024 and supports its long-term growth strategy focused on expanding in adjacent markets.<br /><br />The move strengthens Hillman&#39;s position in the cleaning products category. HLMN currently offers a wide range of gloves to customers across North America. Intex, with its extensive range of cleaning products, will complement Hillman&#39;s existing portfolio. This acquisition will allow HLMN to leverage its distribution network to introduce and service this new product line.<br /><br />The acquisition expands its Protective Solutions (PS) business, which includes well-known work glove brands such as Firm Grip, Gorilla Grip, Grease Monkey, AWP and Digz. HLMN recently partnered with Kontoor Brands to introduce work gloves under the Wrangler brand, set to launch in 2025.<br /><br />Intex DIY, known for its patented and innovative cleaning products, is expected to contribute approximately $55 million in annual revenues in 2024. This addition is anticipated to enhance Hillman&rsquo;s offerings in the cleaning and protective solutions markets.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Price Performance</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of HLMN have moved up 6% in the past three months compared with the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry&rsquo;s 7.5% rise. The company is poised to benefit from accretive, low-risk acquisitions and robust product innovation. It expects EBITDA growth from natural synergies and additional top-line growth through its in-store service team and direct store delivery model.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/82/75516.jpg?v=1085263211" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite a flat overall net sales of $379.4 million in second-quarter 2024, the company saw a 3.5% year-over-year increase in net sales for its Hardware and Protective Solutions (HPS) segment. Hardware sales grew by 2.7%, driven by new business wins and Koch acquisition, though market pricing partially offset gains. PS segment experienced a 7.7% year-over-year increase, fueled by new business wins and strong promotional activity, more than offsetting a challenging market.<br /><br />Hillman anticipates its patented products to drive new business wins and growth beyond historical rates. Earnings estimates for 2024 have moved up to 52 cents from 45 cents in the past 30 days, indicating 26.8% year-over-year growth.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Hillman currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).<br /><br />Here are some better-ranked stocks from the Construction sector.<br /><br /><strong>EMCOR Group, Inc. </strong>EME currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 36.5%, on average. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for EME&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share (EPS) indicates an improvement of 34.9% from the prior-year levels.<br /><br /><strong>Armstrong World Industries, Inc.</strong> AWI currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 15.4%, on average.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for AWI&rsquo;s 2024 sales and EPS indicates growth of 10.1% and 14.1%, respectively, from the prior-year reported levels.<br /><br /><strong>Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. </strong>WMS currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. WMS delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 23.2%, on average.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WMS&rsquo; fiscal 2025 sales and EPS indicates growth of 4.7% and 12.4%, respectively, from the prior-year reported levels.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327806/hillman-expands-cleaning-product-line-with-intex-diy-buyout?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_corporate_actions-2327806">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Avient Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s AVNT shares reached a fresh 52-week high of $49.42 on Aug. 26 before closing at $48.64.</p><p>In the past year, the stock has appreciated 26% against the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 6.8% decline in the same period.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b7/75497.jpg?v=1211830496" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>What&rsquo;s Driving Avient?</h2><p>Avient is optimistic about sustaining its strong momentum from the second quarter throughout the rest of 2024.

The figure marked an increase from $824.4 million in the same period last year.</p><p>Its second-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 76 cents also outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents.

The company expects adjusted EPS of 62 cents for the third quarter, suggesting a 9% year-over-year increase. Both business segments are projected to contribute to organic sales growth, further driving earnings. Although the demand outlook for the second half remains consistent with May projections, robust second-quarter results led to an updated full-year forecast. AVNT anticipates adjusted EBITDA to be between $515 million and $540 million, up from the previous range of $510-$535 million.

<![CDATA[ 3 Truck Stocks to Keep an Eye on From a Challenging Industry ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ The Zacks Transportation-Truck industry is grappling with persistent supply-chain disruptions, a challenging macroeconomic environment characterized by inflation-induced high interest rates and truck driver shortages.<br /><br />Despite macroeconomic challenges causing uncertainty in demand, the industry demonstrates resilience, especially for companies prioritizing growth and operational efficiency. Among the companies in the industry that are likely to survive the challenges are <strong>Knight-Swift Transportation</strong> KNX, <strong>Werner Enterprises </strong>WERN and <strong>Covenant Logistics</strong> CVLG.<br /><br /><p><b>Industry Description</b></p><p>The Zacks Transportation - Truck industry houses truck operators transporting freight to diverse customers across North America. These companies provide full-truckload or less-than-truckload (LTL) services over the short, medium or long haul. The range of trucking services these companies provide includes dry-van, dedicated, refrigerated, flatbed and expedited. Some companies have an extensive fleet of company-owned tractors and trucks and independent contractor trucks. Alongside trucking, most entities offer logistics and intermodal services as well as value-added services like container drayage, truckload brokerage, supply-chain consulting and warehousing. A few also offer asset-light services to other third-party logistics companies in the transportation sector.</p><p><b>3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Trucking Industry</b></p><p><strong><em>Supply-Chain Disruptions &amp; Weak Freight Rates:</em></strong>&nbsp;Although economic activities picked up from the pandemic gloom, supply-chain disruptions continue to dent stocks in the industry. Below-par freight rates are also hurting the industry&rsquo;s prospects. Highlighting the weak freight demand, the Cass Freight Shipments Index declined 1.1% year over year in July. This measure has deteriorated year over year in each of the last six months, which confirms the overall declining trend.</p><p><strong><em>Strong Financial Returns for Shareholders</em></strong><strong><em>:</em></strong>With economic activities gaining pace from the pandemic lows, more companies are allocating their increasing cash pile via dividends and buybacks to pacify long-suffering shareholders. This underlines their financial strength and confidence in the business. Among the players in the Trucking industry, KNX announced an increase in the quarterly dividend this year.</p><p><strong><em>Prolonged Truck-Driver Shortage</em></strong><strong><em>:</em></strong>The persistent driver crisis in the trucking industry is worsening supply-chain challenges across the United States. Driver scarcity issues limit trucking capacity, making it difficult for trucking companies to meet increased freight demand. American Trucking Associations&rsquo; chief economist, Bob Costello, expects the trucking industry to be short of more than&nbsp;160,000 drivers by 2030.</p><p><b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects</b></p><p>The Zacks Transportation - Truck industry is a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #235, which places it in the bottom 6% of 250 plus Zacks industries.</p><p>The group&rsquo;s&nbsp;Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p>The industry&rsquo;s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential. The industry&#39;s earnings estimate for 2024 has decreased 31.4% on a year-over-year basis.</p><p>Before we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to hold on to, let&rsquo;s take a look at the industry&rsquo;s recent stock market performance and the valuation picture.</p><p><b>Truck Industry Underperforms the S&P 500 & Sector </b></p><p>The Zacks Transportation-Truck industry has lagged the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as the Transportation sector over the past year.</p><p>The industry has risen 2.2% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500&#39;s appreciation of 27% and the broader sector&rsquo;s uptick of 2.3%.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">One-Year Price Performance</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/truck price(3).jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 312px;" /></p><p><br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><b>Industry's Current Valuation</b></p><p>Based on the trailing 12-month EV-to-EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), a commonly used multiple for valuing trucking stocks, the industry is currently trading at 14.31X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 18.94X. It is also above the sector&rsquo;s EV/EBITDA of 11.03X.</p><p>Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.8X and as low as 7.56X, with the median being 12.07X, as the chart below shows.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA Ratio (TTM)</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/val sp(40).jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 192px;" /></p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/val sector(42).jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 190px;" /><br /><br />&nbsp;</h3><p><b>3 Transport Truck Stocks to Consider</b></p><p><strong>Knight-Swift</strong>: This truckload carrier is based in Phoenix, AZ. Knight-Swift&rsquo;s efforts to reward its investors through dividends and buybacks bode well. In February 2024, the company&#39;s board of directors approved a dividend hike of 14.2% to 16 cents per share.</p><p>Knight-Swift&rsquo;s cash position is worrisome. KNX currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold). <span style="pd4ml-display: none; pd4ml-visibility: hidden;">&nbsp; You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: KNX</h3><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/knx(31).jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 371px;" /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><br />Headquartered in Omaha, NE, <strong>Werner Enterprises</strong>&rsquo; efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases are commendable. The company&rsquo;s liquidity position is good.</p><p>WERN&rsquo;s cost-control efforts are praiseworthy. WERN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has remained stable over the past seven days.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: WERN<br />&nbsp;<img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/wern price.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 364px;" /><br />&nbsp;</h3><p><br /><strong>Covenant Logistics</strong> offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services, including asset-based expedited, dedicated and irregular route truckload capacity, along with asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage capability.</p><p>CVLG&rsquo;s cost-control efforts are appreciated.

<![CDATA[ Ulta Beauty Gears Up for Q2 Earnings: Things to Keep in Mind ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 14:55:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ulta Beauty, Inc.</strong> ULTA is likely to register top-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on Aug 29. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.62 billion, suggesting an increase of 3.5% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.<br /><br />However, the bottom line is likely to decline year over year. The consensus mark for quarterly earnings has dropped by 1 cent in the past 30 days to $5.49 per share. This indicates a decline of 8.8% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. Nonetheless, ULTA has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.3%, on average.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Things to Consider About ULTA&rsquo;s Upcoming Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Ulta Beauty has been capitalizing on its strategic focus in five key areas &mdash; enhancing its product assortment, boosting social relevance, improving digital experiences, leveraging its top-tier loyalty program and refining promotional strategies. These efforts are likely to have driven comparable sales growth in the low single-digit range for first-half fiscal 2024, reflecting the positive impact of new sales initiatives and a strong product pipeline. Our projections indicate a 1.5% increase in comparable sales for second-quarter fiscal 2024.<br /><br />Favorable trends in the beauty sector position Ulta Beauty well for the to-be-reported quarter. The company&rsquo;s integration of mass, prestige and luxury brands into an engaging shopping experience is proving effective. ULTA&rsquo;s robust operating model and strong brand partnerships are driving increased traffic in physical stores and digital channels.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Ulta Beauty Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Ulta Beauty Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" height="266" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/29/1724751883.png" title="" width="545" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ulta Beauty Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ulta Beauty Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, the company faces a dynamic and challenging environment. Despite proactive measures, management expressed dissatisfaction with current market share trends. Additionally, intense competition within the beauty industry is adding further complexity to the situation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ulta Beauty expects SG&amp;A deleverage in the fiscal 2024, thanks to sales-driving investments (including marketing and store labor), efforts related to the transformational agenda and initiatives to operationalize investments. Management expects SG&amp;A expenses to increase by low-double-digit in the first half of fiscal 2024, raising concerns for the quarter under review. We expect an SG&amp;A expense increase of 12.7% in the fiscal second quarter, with the rate likely expanding 210 basis points (bps) to 25.8%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also, management expects gross margin to deleverage in the first half of fiscal 2024. The downside was caused by soft merchandise margins and fixed cost deleverage. We expect a gross margin contraction of 20 bps in the fiscal second quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Whispers for Ulta Beauty</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Ulta Beauty this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />ULTA carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.97%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Some Stocks With Favorable Combination</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some companies worth considering, as our model shows that these, too, have the correct combination to beat on earnings this time around.<br /><br /><strong>American Eagle Outfitters</strong> AEO currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.97% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is likely to register bottom- and top-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2024 results. The consensus mark for AEO&rsquo;s quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.3 billion, indicating an 8.7% rise from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.

<![CDATA[ Insulet's Omnipod 5 Wins FDA Approval for Type 2 Diabetes ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Insulet Corp.</strong>&rsquo;s PODD groundbreaking Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery (&ldquo;AID&rdquo;) system (Omnipod 5) received the FDA&rsquo;s approval for use by type 2 diabetes patients (ages 18 years and above). The news comes after the company submitted 510(k) for an expanded indication of Omnipod 5 to the FDA, in June 2024, based on the favorable clinical outcomes of the SECURE-T2D pivotal trial.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With this development, Omnipod 5 is the first and only AID system indicated for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</p><h2>Insulet&rsquo;s Robust Opportunity in the Type 2 Space</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Diabetes is a chronic and life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. The more common variant, type 2 diabetes, is characterized by the body&rsquo;s inability to either properly utilize or produce enough insulin. More than 30 million people are living with type 2 diabetes in the United States, with approximately 6 million people requiring insulin. Of these, roughly 2.5 million are using multiple daily injections (&ldquo;MDI&rdquo;) &mdash; a form of insulin therapy that involves injecting fast-acting insulin before meals (bolus) to lower blood glucose levels to a healthy range.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although medical therapies have advanced in the past 20 years, the percentage of adults with type 2 diabetes achieving recommended HbA1c (a common measure of blood glucose levels) targets&nbsp;has not seen any significant change. Only a quarter of individuals with type 2 diabetes on insulin are achieving an HbA1c of 7% or less and half of this population has an HbA1c greater than 8%.&nbsp;Despite guideline recommendations for insulin treatment in advanced disease, insulin therapy is often delayed or not appropriately intensified.</p><h2>The SECURE-T2D Trial Boosts Approval of PODD&rsquo;s Omnipod 5</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">This is the largest study ever completed for the use of AID in type 2 diabetes, featuring highly diverse study participants who are representative of the general population in the United States. Insulet recently presented data showing that Omnipod 5 significantly improves health outcomes while making life easier for people with type 2 diabetes.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/2f/75532.jpg?v=2091424716" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The trial demonstrated that compared with prior insulin therapy methods in adults with type 2 diabetes, using Omnipod 5 resulted in considerable reductions in HbA1c &mdash; 0.8% overall and 2.1% in those with prior HbA1c 9% or higher. Time in hyperglycemia and total daily insulin dose were also reduced. In addition, there was a 20% improvement in time in range, increasing 4.8 hours per day, without increasing time in hypoglycemia. The study also demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in diabetes distress.</p><h2>Insulet&rsquo;s Omnipod 5 Simplifies Type 2 Diabetes Management</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The latest announcement from the company represents a significant milestone for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, providing an easy-to-use, patient-centric technology. The tubeless pod therapy, Omnipod 5, has set a new standard in diabetes management, allowing individuals to achieve better health outcomes while giving them greater confidence and freedom in their daily lives. Insulet&#39;s president and CEO expressed excitement about the opportunity to make a lasting impact on the insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes community.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Omnipod 5 System leads to improved results by eliminating the need for MDI and automatically adjusting insulin delivery every 5 minutes, using its advanced SmartAdjust technology. As the top-rated and most prescribed pump in the United States, Omnipod 5 is waterproof, discreet and wearable. This is the first tubeless AID system that communicates with a continuous glucose monitor, proactively correcting for highs and protecting against lows, day and night. The system is easy to prescribe through the pharmacy and widely covered by many insurance plans, including Medicare Part D.</p><h2>Insulet&rsquo;s Prospects in the Type 2 Diabetes Industry</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per a Precedence Research report, the global market for type 2 diabetes was valued at $32 billion in 2022 and expected to witness a CAGR of 8.2% by 2032.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The introduction of new, more effective and safer therapeutic compounds is paving the way for the development of new treatments. Additionally, the rising obesity epidemic in many regions of the world is boosting the industry&rsquo;s profitability. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recent Developments of Insulet</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Insulet unveiled its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Malaysia this month, which strategically positions the company to cater to the huge demand for Omnipod. The 400,000-square-foot facility strengthens the company&rsquo;s global operational capabilities and supply chain resiliency and currently runs with a local workforce that has been upskilled and trained.</p><h2>PODD&rsquo;s Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past year, Insulet shares have lost 0.3% against the industry&rsquo;s rise of 14%.</p><h2>Zacks Rank and Key MedTech Stocks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Insulet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are <strong>Exact Sciences </strong>EXAS, <strong>Boston Scientific </strong>BSX, and <strong>SiBone</strong> SIBN. Each of these carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Exact Sciences&rsquo; shares have fallen 25.3% in the past year. Estimates for the company&rsquo;s loss per share have improved from $1.09 to 95 cents in 2024 and from 26 cents to 6 cents in 2025 in the past 30 days. EXAS&rsquo; earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and matched in one, delivering an average surprise of 56.2%. In the last reported quarter, it posted an earnings surprise of 75.7%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Estimates for Boston Scientific&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share have moved to $2.40 from $2.36 in the past 30 days. Shares of the company have gained 47.8% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 13.7%. BSX&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.2%. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 6.9%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Estimates for SiBone&rsquo;s 2024 loss per share have narrowed to 89 cents from 95 cents in the past 30 days. Shares of the company have lost 20.6% in the past year against the industry&rsquo;s 12.3% growth. SIBN&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 13.4%. In the last reported quarter, it delivered an earnings surprise of 15.4%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327736/insulet-s-omnipod-5-wins-fda-approval-for-type-2-diabetes?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_medical_sector-2327736">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Federal Realty Stock Up 18.2% in 3 Months: Will It Continue to Rise? ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <strong>Federal Realty Investment Trust</strong> FRT have rallied 18.2% in the past three months, outperforming the&nbsp;industry&#39;s growth of 14.4%.</p><p>Last month, the retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported second-quarter 2024 funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.69, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.68. Results reflected healthy leasing activity and better-than-expected growth in revenues.</p><p>This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company also raised its guidance for 2024. It projected FFO per share in the range of $6.70-$6.88 from the $6.67-$6.87 range guided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is presently pegged at $6.81, within expectations.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d0/75545.jpg?v=1342798234" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><strong>Factors Behind FRT&#39;s Stock Price Surge: Will This Trend Last?</strong></h2><p>Federal Realty&rsquo;s portfolio of premium retail assets &mdash; situated in the major coastal markets from Washington, D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles &mdash; along with a diverse tenant base, both national and local, positions it well for decent growth.The company is experiencing decent leasing activity, aiding occupancy growth. For the second quarter of 2024, Federal Realty signed 124 leases for 600,669 square feet of retail space.</p><p>Federal Realty has been capitalizing on expansion opportunities in premium markets, which leads to income growth and creates long-term value. Since the beginning of the second quarter of 2024 through Aug. 1, 2024, the company has acquired two assets totaling 880,000 square feet on 129 acres for $275 million. Moreover, to optimize its portfolio and strengthen its balance sheet, the company sold off its remaining assets on Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, CA, for $103 million during the same period.</p><p>Federal Realty is also focused on diversifying its portfolio with residential and office properties. The company is exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years as it helps catch the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area.</p><p>Federal Realty focuses on maintaining a decent balance sheet position with ample liquidity. The company exited the second quarter of 2024 with $1.3 billion of total liquidity in cash and credit facility. FRT has no debt maturities remaining in 2024 and no material maturities until 2026.</p><p>Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders, and Federal Realty remains committed to that. The company has paid out uninterrupted dividends since its inception in 1962, and the latest hike on Aug. 1, 2024, marked the 57th consecutive year of common dividend increases by the company. Given FRT&rsquo;s solid operating platform, our FFO growth projections and balance sheet strength compared with industry counterparts, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable in the upcoming period.</p><h2><strong>Key Risks for FRT</strong></h2><p>Higher e-commerce adoption and potential tenant bankruptcies might weigh on Federal Realty. Macroeconomic uncertainty adds to its concerns.</p><h2><strong>Stocks to Consider</strong></h2><p>Some better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are&nbsp;<strong>Regency Centers </strong>REG and&nbsp;<strong>Simon Property Group </strong>SPG, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Regency Centers&rsquo; 2024 FFO per share has moved marginally northward in the past month to $4.22.</p><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Simon Property&rsquo;s 2024 FFO per share has increased marginally over the past month to $12.85.</p><p>Note:&nbsp;<em>Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.</em></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327733/federal-realty-stock-up-18-2-in-3-months-will-it-continue-to-rise?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|price_surge_/_plunge-2327733">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Pre-Markets Slip Into Negative Territory ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 14:44:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Pre-market futures started out in positive territory early this morning, but an hour before the opening bell they&rsquo;ve slipped slightly into the red: the Dow, coming off a record-high close Monday, is down -38 points, the S&amp;P 500 -5 and the Nasdaq -32 points.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We&rsquo;re still three weeks away from the start of the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, where the Fed will decide what to do with interest rates. Since July of last year, they&rsquo;ve been in the 5.25-5.50% range, and economic metrics appear to have come down sufficiently to begin cutting. Whether this will be by 25 basis points (bps) or 50 bps will be dependent on data.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Case-Shiller Home Prices</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The June print on Case-Shiller home prices notched its fifth-straight hike and yet another all-time high. Month over month, this metric grew +0.2% &mdash; slower than the +0.3% reported the previous month &mdash; and +6.5% year over year, above the +6.3% analysts were expecting.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Because these figures are always a couple months in arrears, it&rsquo;s not designed to predict future moves from the Fed or elsewhere. But it is the definitive report on domestic home prices, and continues moving slightly upward. For June, New York City led the way with +9% price gains, followed by San Diego at +8.7% and Las Vegas at +8.5%. The Southwest looks to be making a comeback these days.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h2><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Reports Today: HAIN, BMO and More</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Retail tea and snack brand company <strong>Hain Celestial</strong> HAIN outperformed fiscal Q4 estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning. Earnings of 13 cents per share surpassed the 8 cents in the Zacks consensus, while revenues of $418.8 million &mdash; still more than -6% below year-ago sales levels &mdash; outpaced the $418.23 million analysts were expecting. This is the stock&rsquo;s fifth-straight earnings beat, and shares are +4% in early trading on the news.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bank of Montreal </strong>BMO, on the other hand, came up short of estimates in its fiscal Q3 this morning. Earnings of $1.93 per share was light of the Zacks consensus by a solid nickel, while revenues marginally missed expectations by -0.21%. Shares are down -2.5% in the pre-market, adding to the -10% losses year to date. For more on BMO&rsquo;s earnings, click here. https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327410/bank-of-montreal-bmo-lags-q3-earnings-and-revenue-estimates</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After today&rsquo;s closing bell, we expect earnings reports from luxury department store <strong>Nordstrom</strong> JWN and Tommy Hilfiger/Calvin Klein, etc. parent <strong>PVH</strong> PVH (formerly Phillips-Van Heusen, know for its Izod brand in the 1980s). Nordstrom earnings are expected to come in -12% year over year, while PVH looks to come in +14% on its bottom line. We&rsquo;ll also hear from cloud-based management company <strong>Box</strong> BOX this afternoon, which is expected to have grown earnings by +11%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327732/pre-markets-slip-into-negative-territory?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-economic_highlights-2327732">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>Ryder System</strong> R scaled a 52-week high of $143.73 in the trading session on Aug. 26, 2024, before closing a tad lower at $141.25.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s shares have gained 25.2% over the past six months, steadily outperforming the 16.4% rise of the industry it belongs to.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/33/75496.jpg?v=1944454949" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Why the Uptick in the Ryder Stock?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Ryder&rsquo;s bottom line has been benefitting from its consistent efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are appreciative. In 2022, Ryder paid dividends of $123 million and repurchased shares worth $557 million. In 2023, Ryder paid dividends of $128 million and repurchased shares worth $337 million. During the first six months of 2024, Ryder paid dividends of $66 million and repurchased shares worth $141 million. Such shareholder-friendly moves indicate the company&rsquo;s commitment to creating value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Highlighting its pro-investor stance,on July 12, 2024, Ryder&rsquo;s board of directors approved a dividend hike of 14.1%, thereby raising its quarterly cash dividend to 81 cents per share ($3.24 annualized) from 71 cents ($2.84 annualized). The raised dividend will be paid out on Sep. 20, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Aug. 19. The move reflects R&rsquo;s intention to utilize free cash to enhance its shareholders&rsquo; returns.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Ryder System, Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)</h3> <img alt="Ryder System, Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)" height="288" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/01/1724763379.png" title="" width="610" /> <p>Ryder System, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | Ryder System, Inc. Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">This marks Ryder&rsquo;s 192nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend. Notably, Ryder has been making uninterrupted dividend payments for more than 48 years. This highlights its financial bliss.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Further, Ryder has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company&#39;s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 12.37%. Ryder has updated its 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance to be between $11.90 and $12.40 compared with the prior guided range of $11.75 - $12.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.19 lies within the updated guidance.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2024, the company has raised the lower end of its adjusted ROE (return on equity) guidance in the 16%-16.5% band (prior view: 15.5%-16.5%).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ryder&#39;s cost-cutting initiatives in response to the weak freight market conditions are also commendable. Notably, the company has reduced its 2024 capital expenditure guidance to around $2.9 billion from the $3.2 billion expected previously.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Higher free cash flow generation expectation (this reflects lower capital spending due to softer lease sales activity) for the full year is an added positive. For 2024, Ryder now expects to generate $150-$250 million of free cash flow, which marks an improvement of almost $400 million from the prior expectation of $(175)-$(275) million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter/third-quarter 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 4.9% over the past 90 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings has also been revised upward by 1% over the past 90 days.</p><h2>Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, Ryder carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some top-rankedstocks from the Zacks Transportation sector are <strong>C.H. Robinson Worldwide (</strong>CHRW<strong>) </strong>and <strong>Wabtec Corporation </strong>WAB.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CHRW has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company&#39;s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters (missed the mark in the remaining quarter), delivering an average surprise of 7.33%. CHRW sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">CHRW has an expected earnings growth rate of 22.42% for 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CHRW 2024 earnings has been revised 11.3% upward over the past 90 days. Shares of CHRW have gained 14.3% so far this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">WAB Lease has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company&#39;s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters (missed the mark in the remaining quarter), delivering an average surprise of 11.83%. WAB currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WAB&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has been revised 3.3% upward over the past 90 days. WAB has an expected earnings growth rate of 25.34% for 2024. Shares of WAB have gained 23.5% so far this year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327727/r-stock-hits-52-week-high-on-dividend-strength-more-upside-ahead?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|52week_high/low-2327727">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ CNA Financial Stock Gains 31% in a Year: Will the Rally Last? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 14:39:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of <strong>CNA Financial Corporation </strong>CNA have gained 31% in the past year compared with the industry&#39;s growth of 28.8%. The Finance sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 index have returned 27.9% and 27.1% in the said time frame, respectively. With a market capitalization of $13.87 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 0.3 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b3/75513.jpg?v=416329666" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The rally was largely driven by solid premium writing underwriting expertise, a sturdy balance sheet and capital deployment, along with growth projections.<br /><br />This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer has a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed twice, the average being 9.09%.<br /><br />CNA Financial&rsquo;s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) expanded 80 basis points (bps) to 14% in the first half of 2024. The core ROE expanded 50 bps to 10.9% in the first half of 2024. ROE reflects the insurer&rsquo;s efficiency in using shareholders&rsquo; funds.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Will the Bull Run Continue?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNA Financial&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share indicates a year-over-year increase of 3.1% from the consensus estimate of 2023. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $12.54 billion, implying a year-over-year improvement of 6.5% from the consensus mark of 2023. The consensus estimate for 2025 earnings per share and revenues indicates an increase of 2.8% and 5.5%, respectively, from the corresponding 2024 estimates.<br /><br />CNA Financial&rsquo;s premiums should continue to grow on solid retention, favorable renewal premium change and new business growth across Specialty, Commercial and International segments.<br /><br />Net investment income should continue to benefit from fixed-income securities and other investments, as well as a rise in income from limited partnership and common stock investments. Favorable reinvestment yields and strong operating cash flows add to the upside. CNA Financial&rsquo;s fixed-income investment strategy, with the highest allocations to diversified investment grade corporates, as well as highly rated municipal securities, should continue to drive improved investment results.<br /><br />CNA Financial has a solid balance sheet with capital remaining above the target levels required for all ratings. It exited the second quarter of 2024 with $11 billion in statutory surplus. CNA continues to maintain a conservative capital structure with a low leverage ratio and a well-balanced debt maturity schedule. It continues to maintain liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, which help it sustain business variability.<br /><br />Consistent cash flow generation, backed by strong underwriting performance, supports the insurer in distributing wealth to its shareholders. While CNA has paid special dividends for 10 years, its quarterly dividend rose at a 10-year CAGR of 5.8%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Risk Factors for CNA</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">However, CNA Financial remains exposed to catastrophe loss stemming from natural disasters and weather-related events. Catastrophe losses pose an inherent risk to the P&amp;C insurance business because of its unpredictability, inducing volatility in the company&rsquo;s results. Moreover, CNA Financial has been witnessing rising expenses over the past few years, primarily due to increasing net incurred claims and benefits and amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The company&rsquo;s net operating income has been affected by this increasing trend, which, in turn, might hurt its overall profitability.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks from the property and casualty insurance industry are <strong>NMI Holdings Inc</strong> NMIH, <strong>Palomar Holdings, Inc.</strong> PLMR and <strong>Arch Capital Group Ltd.</strong> ACGL, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.<br /><br />NMI Holdings&rsquo; earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 10.15%. Shares of NMIH have jumped 40.3% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NMIH&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 16.9% and 5.2%, respectively.<br /><br />Palomar Holdings&rsquo; earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 17.10%. Shares of PLMR have skyrocketed 99.8% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLMR&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 30.8% and 19.8%, respectively.<br /><br />Arch Capital&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 28.93%. Shares of ACGL have jumped 47.6% in the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACGL&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 6.6% and 2.4%, respectively.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327791/cna-financial-stock-gains-31-in-a-year-will-the-rally-last?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|price_surge_/_plunge-2327791">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Graco Boosts Portfolio With the Acquisition of PCT Systems ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Graco Inc.</strong> GGG has recently completed the acquisition of the megasonic and ultrasonic wet cleaning systems business of PCT Systems (&ldquo;PCT&rdquo;). The financial terms of the transaction have been kept under wraps.<br /><br />Based in San Jose, CA, PCT specializes in designing and manufacturing a range of products, including heated process tanks, megasonic generators, transducer assemblies and custom tanks. These are crafted from stainless steel, plastics and quartz. It serves industries like semiconductors, optics, glass and additives.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Acquisition Rationale</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The latest buyout is in sync with Graco&rsquo;s policy of acquiring businesses to strengthen its business and expand market share. The inclusion of PCT&rsquo;s business will enhance GGG&rsquo;s portfolio of high-purity chemical delivery equipment that is used for making semiconductors, solar panels, LED displays and other electronics. This acquisition aligns with the company&rsquo;s White Knight business and will enable it to expand its presence in the semiconductor market.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Graco&rsquo;s Zacks Rank and Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">GGG currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Weakness in the broader industrial sector has been negatively impacting its results. An increase in general and administrative expenses might continue affecting Graco&rsquo;s profitability. Given its international presence, forex woes are an added concern.<br /><br />In the past year, the stock gained 5.8% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 22.3% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9d/75558.jpg?v=850694905" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Graco expects improving order rates and product innovations to drive its performance in the quarters ahead. Its investments in manufacturing and distribution facilities are expected to foster growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Better-ranked companies from the same space are discussed below.<br /><br /><strong>Flowserve Corporation</strong> FLS currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />FLS delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 18.2%. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Flowserve&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has increased 3.8%.<br /><br /><strong>Crane Company</strong> CR presently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. The company delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 11.2%.<br /><br />In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CR&rsquo;s 2024 earnings has increased 2%.<br /><br /><strong>Ferguson Enterprises Inc.</strong> FERG currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. FERG delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 2.6%.<br /><br />In the past 60 days, the consensus estimate for Ferguson&rsquo;s fiscal 2025 earnings has remained steady.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327725/graco-boosts-portfolio-with-the-acquisition-of-pct-systems?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_corporate_actions-2327725">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Rhythm Stock Up as FDA Accepts Obesity Drug sNDA for Younger Kids ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 14:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rhythm Pharmaceuticals</strong>&rsquo; RYTM shares gained 8.4% on Aug. 26 after announcing the FDA&rsquo;s acceptance of the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for its only marketed drug, Imcivree (setmelanotide), to treat obesity in children as young as two years old, under the Priority Review pathway. A filing designated as a Priority Review reduces the review period to four months. A final decision from the FDA is expected on Dec. 26, 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Imcivree, an MC4R agonist, is already approved in the United States and EU for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients aged six years and older. The eligible patient population includes those with monogenic or syndromic obesity due toBardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) or pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), including proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rhythm&rsquo;s sNDA is looking to expand the eligible patient population for the drug by lowering the minimum required age to receive Imcivree treatment to two years in the United States. In July 2024, the drug&rsquo;s label was expanded in the EU to include children aged two years with obesity due to BBS or POMC/PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date, shares of RYTM have gained 8.8% against the industry&rsquo;s 0.2% decline.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/25/75509.jpg?v=305488701" style="width: 600px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Subject to the approval of the sNDA, Rhythm believes that Imcivree has the potential to become a precision therapy option for younger patients in the&nbsp;United States&nbsp;experiencing hyperphagia and severe obesity caused by rare MC4R pathway diseases. Hyperphagia is an abnormally increased appetite for food, often leading to excessive eating and thereby, obesity.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The sNDA submission for Imcivree was based on positive data from the company&rsquo;s late-stage study of the drug in patients aged two to six years with obesity due to biallelic POMC/PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency or a clinical diagnosis of BBS.&nbsp;Per the data readout from the study, treatment with Imcivree showed potential efficacy in controlling hyperphagia and reducing severe obesity in the enrolled patient population.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rhythm&rsquo;s phase III obesity study for the label expansion of Imcivree met its primary endpoint achieving a 3.04 mean reduction in BMI-Z score (a measure of body mass index deviations from what is considered normal) and an 18.4% mean reduction in BMI.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">RYTM also has a broad clinical development program for setmelanotide in other rare diseases, as well as other investigational MC4R agonists in its pipeline like LB54640 and&nbsp;RM-718.&nbsp;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The estimate for 2025 is currently pegged at an earnings of 21 cents per share. Year to date, shares of Arcturus Therapeutics have lost 32%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Earnings of Arcturus Therapeutics beat estimates in each of the last four quarters. ARCT delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 56.73%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 60 days, the consensus estimate for Bioventus&rsquo; 2024 earnings per share has risen from 27 cents to 40 cents.

<![CDATA[ UPS Boosts Malaysian Footprint Through Ninja Van Partnership ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 14:34:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>United Parcel Service, Inc. (</strong>UPS<strong>) </strong>inked a deal with Ninja Van Malaysia to expand the reach of its express delivery services in Malaysia. Through this deal, Ninja Van Malaysia becomes an authorized seller of select UPS products through its retail services in Malaysia.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The deal makes UPS&#39; Worldwide Express and Express Saver services available in Malaysia at any of Ninja Van Malaysia&#39;s 52 self-owned stores across Klang Valley. Customers can also access their nearest Ninja Van location via the UPS drop-off locator on ups.com.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">UPS Worldwide Express is a time-definite service that provides delivery as early as 10 a.m. UPS Express Saver is a day-definite service that provides delivery by the end of the day. Both provide delivery across Asia Pacific as early as the next business day and to the rest of the world in as little as two business days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ingrid Sidiadinoto, senior managing director of UPS Malaysia, stated, &quot;This is a really exciting announcement as it provides more businesses in Malaysia with faster, more convenient access to UPS&#39;s industry-leading global delivery network.&quot;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Strategic business moves in the form of acquisitions and partnerships have always been an integral policy of UPS to generate more revenues and expand geographically. This latest deal with Ninja Van Malaysia is in-line with its strategy of boosting global presence.

<![CDATA[ Campbell Soup's Q4 Earnings Coming Up: What Awaits CPB Stock? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 14:33:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Campbell Soup Company</strong> CPB is likely to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings on Aug. 29. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.31 billion, which suggests an increase of 11.5% from the prior-year quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.<br /><br />The consensus mark for quarterly earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at 62 cents per share. This indicates growth of 24% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. CPB has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.9%, on average.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Things to Note About CPB&rsquo;s Upcoming Release</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Campbell Soup has been gaining from its focus on prioritizing execution, innovation and strong collaboration with retail partners to stay relevant and succeed by delivering both quality and value. The positive trends in market share growth and stabilizing volumes despite a dynamic operating landscape are encouraging and are likely to contribute to the upcoming results.<br /><br />Campbell Soup&#39;s Snacks division is well-positioned, driven by the strength of its power brands and strategic optimization initiatives. Despite the current challenges, the division&#39;s resilience and long-term growth potential make it a vital component of the company&#39;s overall portfolio.&nbsp; Although there has been a recent slowdown due to prolonged economic pressure on lower and middle-income consumers, this modest slowdown is less severe than other edible categories, reflecting the enduring consumer demand for snacks.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise<br /><br /><img alt="Campbell Soup Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/97/1724757288.png" title="" width="576" /> </h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Campbell Soup Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Campbell Soup Company Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">The upcoming results are likely to reflect contributions from the Sovos Brands acquisition, which was concluded in March 2024 and added seven percentage points to the company&rsquo;s reported net sales growth in the third quarter. The performance of Sovos Brands, particularly Rao&#39;s, has been outstanding, with sales growing faster than expected, contributing positively to adjusted EBIT.<br /><br />However, Campbell Soup remains affected by a dynamic macroeconomic scenario. The company is witnessing volatile consumer behaviors, especially among lower-income segments. The persistence of these headwinds could be a concern. The company now expects organic net sales growth to be nearly flat to down 1% in fiscal 2024.&nbsp; In its third-quarter earnings release, management stated that it was then tracking toward the midpoint of this updated organic sales growth view, indicating the consumer recovery pace.&nbsp;<br /><br />CPB witnessed core inflation in the low single digits during the third quarter and expects it to remain within this range for the remainder of fiscal 2024. The company remains focused on managing areas of its portfolio affected by the rising cost of inputs, including tomatoes, olive oil and cocoa, as well as ongoing inflation in labor and warehousing expenses. However, its productivity initiatives and cost-savings programs are likely to balance the impact of inflation in the fourth quarter. Our model suggests an adjusted gross margin expansion of 50 basis points to 31.1% in the fourth quarter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What the Zacks Model Unveils for CPB</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model doesn&rsquo;t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Campbell Soup this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.<br /><br />Campbell Soup carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.19%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks With the Favorable Combination</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some companies worth considering, as our model shows that these have the correct combination to beat on earnings this time.<br /><br /><strong>American Eagle Outfitters</strong> AEO currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.97% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is likely to register bottom and top-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2024 results. The consensus mark for AEO&rsquo;s quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.3 billion, which indicates an 8.7% rise from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong><br /><br />The consensus mark for AEO&rsquo;s quarterly earnings has moved up a penny in the past 30 days to 38 cents. The consensus estimate indicates growth of 52% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s actual.<br /><br /><strong>Costco Wholesale Corporation </strong>COST currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.89% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for COST&rsquo;s quarterly revenues is pegged at $80.1 billion, which suggests growth of 1.4% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.&nbsp;<br /><br />The consensus estimate for Costco&rsquo;s earnings has remained unchanged in the past 30 days at $5.02. The consensus mark for earnings indicates growth of 3.3% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. COST delivered an earnings beat of 2.3%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.<br /><br /><strong>Burlington Stores</strong> BURL has an Earnings ESP of +2.68% and a Zacks Rank of 3 at present. BURL is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it posts second-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its quarterly earnings has increased by a penny in the past seven days to 95 cents. The consensus mark for earnings indicates a 58.3% surge from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $2.42 billion, which calls for a rise of 11.2% from the top line reported in the year-ago quarter. BURL delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 21.7%.<br /><br />Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327721/campbell-soup-s-q4-earnings-coming-up-what-awaits-cpb-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2327721">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

The company is recognized for its innovation in fiber laser technology, which provides advantages such as higher efficiency, precision, and reliability compared to traditional lasers.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Founded in 1990 and headquartered in Oxford, Massachusetts, IPG Photonics serves a wide range of industries, including automotive, aerospace, electronics, and healthcare. Its products are used in applications such as welding, cutting, marking, and engraving, as well as in medical procedures and communications infrastructure. IPG Photonics has grown to become a dominant player in the fiber laser market, driven by its technological leadership and global reach.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Despite its leading position in the market, IPG Photonics&rsquo; core business has struggled in recent years. Sales have been flat to contracting for six years now, while the stock performance is flat over that period as well. Furthermore, analysts have downgraded earnings expectations at IPGP, giving it a <strong>Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) </strong>rating and the stock price is plunging to new lows. The downside risk is further complicated by its premium valuation, which may no longer be appropriate for a business with falling sales.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Based on these factors, it seems investors may want to avoid IPG Photonics stock until one or more of the variables turn more positive.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/65/75477.jpg?v=457306541" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Photonics IPG Shares Down on Falling Earnings Estimates</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The earnings revision trend at IPGP has absolutely plunged over the last month, reflecting analysts&#39; concern for the business performance and giving it a <strong>Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) </strong>rating. Analysts have unanimously lowered estimates across timeframes and by a significant margin.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Current quarter earnings estimates have been lowered by 76.2%, next quarter by 76.3%, FY24 by 50% and FY25 by 51.4%. Sales are also expected to fall 24.4% this year and then rebound by 5.8% next year.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f9/75475.jpg?v=1562800090" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Photonics IPG Shares Trade at a Premium Valuation</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Because of the collapse in earnings over the last few years, Photonics IPG&rsquo;s earnings multiple has rocketed higher. However, it seems that the market has not yet discounted the low growth rates expected in the company, as this premium valuation appears unreasonable.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Today, IPGP is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 51.2x, well above its five-year median of 29.4x and the broad market average.</span></span></p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/65/75476.jpg?v=469884335" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Should Investors Buy Photonics IPG Stock?</strong></span></span></h2><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Given IPG Photonics&#39; struggles with flat-to-contracting sales and declining earnings, the stock faces significant headwinds. Analysts have sharply reduced earnings estimates and despite these challenges, the stock&#39;s premium valuation is difficult to justify for a business with declining growth.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">For potential investors, the combination of deteriorating financial performance and an elevated valuation presents a high level of risk. Until the company can demonstrate a clear turnaround in sales growth and profitability, the stock may continue to face downward pressure.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2327304/bear-of-the-day-ipg-photonics-ipgp?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-bear_of_the_day-2327304">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Burlington Stores Q2 Earnings on the Deck: Factors to Note for BURL ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 14:22:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">As <strong>Burlington Stores, Inc.</strong> BURL readies to announce its second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings, investors are closely watching for insights into the company&#39;s performance amid a challenging retail landscape. The earnings report, scheduled for release on Aug. 29 before the opening bell, is expected to provide critical indicators of how Burlington Stores has navigated recent economic shifts.<br /><br />The company is anticipated to show a notable increase in its top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is set at $2.42 billion, implying an 11.3% rise from the prior year&#39;s reported figure. This potential growth reflects Burlington&#39;s ability to maintain momentum despite a tough retail environment.<br /><br />Burlington Stores is also expected to deliver strong bottom-line growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share has risen by a penny to 95 cents over the past seven days, indicating a substantial increase from the 60 cents reported in the same quarter last year. This suggests that the off-price retailer, known for offering high-quality branded apparel at everyday low prices, continues to enhance its profitability.<br /><br />Burlington Stores has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 21.7%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Burlington, NJ-based company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 36.5%.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors to Consider Ahead of BURL&rsquo;s Q2 Earnings</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Burlington Stores&rsquo; ability to acclimatize to consumer trends and preferences gives it an edge in the competitive retail landscape. By staying attuned to what customers want and adjusting its product offerings accordingly, the company is better positioned to capture additional market share. The company has been adept at balancing promotions with maintaining regular price sales, which helps attract budget-conscious shoppers while protecting margins. As consumers continue to seek out deals, Burlington Stores&rsquo; well-timed promotions and attractive pricing should have driven traffic to its stores.<br /><br />The implementation of strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing merchandising capabilities, operational efficiency and store optimization is likely to have supported revenue growth in the second quarter. By focusing on initiatives such as store opening in key markets, relocations and downsizing, Burlington Stores aims to improve store productivity. The ability to quickly respond to evolving market dynamics and adjust inventory levels based on real-time data insights has enabled the company to seize opportunities. We expect comparable store sales to increase 1.5% during the second quarter.<br /><br />Despite the aforementioned tailwinds, we cannot ignore concerns related to the company&#39;s dependency on lower-income customers and other operational challenges. The economic landscape remains uncertain, marked by geopolitical tensions and economic pressures on consumers, which may impact spending behaviors.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Burlington Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"> <img alt="Burlington Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/83/1724760073.png" title="" width="589" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Burlington Stores, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Burlington Stores, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Whispers for BURL</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As investors prepare for Burlington Stores&#39; second-quarter earnings, the question looms regarding earnings beat or miss. Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Burlington Stores this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />Burlington Stores has an Earnings ESP of +2.68% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they&rsquo;re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">3 More Stocks With the Favorable Combination</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are three other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:<br /><br /><strong>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co.</strong> ANF has an Earnings ESP of +3.50% and a Zacks Rank of 2 at present. The company is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ANF&rsquo;s quarterly earnings has increased by a penny in the past seven days to $2.14. The consensus mark for earnings indicates a 94.6% surge from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.&nbsp;<br /><br />The consensus estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1.09 billion, which implies a rise of 16.5% from the year-ago quarter. ANF delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 210.3%.<br /><br /><strong>Costco Wholesale Corporation</strong> COST currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.89% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for COST&rsquo;s quarterly revenues is pegged at $80.1 billion, which implies growth of 1.4% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for Costco&rsquo;s bottom line has been stable at $5.02 per share over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for earnings suggests growth of 3.3% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. COST delivered an earnings beat of 2.3%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.<br /><br /><strong>Chewy</strong> CHWY currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.55% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is expected to register top and bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2024 numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CHWY&rsquo;s quarterly revenues is pegged at $2.86 billion, which suggests growth of 3% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure.<br /><br />The consensus estimate for Chewy&rsquo;s bottom line has been stable at 22 cents a share over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for earnings suggests growth of 46.7% from the year-ago quarter&rsquo;s reported figure. CHWY delivered an earnings beat of 57.7%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.<br /><br />Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327713/burlington-stores-q2-earnings-on-the-deck-factors-to-note-for-burl?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|earnings_preview-2327713">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Pre-Markets Follow Dow's Record High Slightly in the Red ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Tuesday, August 27th, 2024</strong><br /><br />Pre-market futures started out in positive territory early this morning, but an hour before the opening bell they&rsquo;ve slipped slightly into the red: the Dow, coming off a record-high close Monday, is down -38 points, the S&amp;P 500 -5 and the Nasdaq -32 points.<br /><br />We&rsquo;re still three weeks away from the start of the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, where the Fed will decide what to do with interest rates. Since July of last year, they&rsquo;ve been in the 5.25-5.50% range, and economic metrics appear to have come down sufficiently to begin cutting. Whether this will be by 25 basis points (bps) or 50 bps will be dependent on data.<br /><br /><h2>Case-Shiller Home Prices<br /></h2><br />The June print on Case-Shiller home prices notched its fifth-straight hike and yet another all-time high. Month over month, this metric grew +0.2% &mdash; slower than the +0.3% reported the previous month &mdash; and +6.5% year over year, above the +6.3% analysts were expecting.<br /><br />Because these figures are always a couple months in arrears, it&rsquo;s not designed to predict future moves from the Fed or elsewhere. But it is the definitive report on domestic home prices, and continues moving slightly upward. For June, New York City led the way with +9% price gains, followed by San Diego at +8.7% and Las Vegas at +8.5%. The Southwest looks to be making a comeback these days.<br /><br /><h2>Earnings Reports Today: HAIN, BMO and More<br /></h2><br />Retail tea and snack brand company <strong>Hain Celestial </strong>HAIN outperformed fiscal Q4 estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning. Earnings of 13 cents per share surpassed the 8 cents in the Zacks consensus, while revenues of $418.8 million &mdash; still more than -6% below year-ago sales levels &mdash; outpaced the $418.23 million analysts were expecting. This is the stock&rsquo;s fifth-straight earnings beat, and shares are +4% in early trading on the news.<br /><br /><strong>Bank of Montreal</strong> BMO, on the other hand, came up short of estimates in its fiscal Q3 this morning. Earnings of $1.93 per share was light of the Zacks consensus by a solid nickel, while revenues marginally missed expectations by -0.21%.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Air Transport Services Group, Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s ATSG efforts to expand and upgrade its fleet are commendable. Decreasing operating costs also bode well for the company&rsquo;s bottom line. Owing to the tailwinds, ATSG shares have performed impressively on the bourse. If you have not taken advantage of its share price appreciation yet, it&rsquo;s time to do so.</p><h2><strong>Factors That Make ATSG Stock Worth Betting On</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Robust Stock Price Performance: </strong>A look at the company&rsquo;s price trend reveals that its shares have risen 6.1% in the past 30 days, surpassing the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 0.9% decline.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7d/75515.jpg?v=1994102998" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Northward Estimate Revisions:&nbsp;</strong>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has been revised upward by 15.1% over the past 60 days for the current year. For the upcoming quarter, the consensus mark for earnings per share has moved 38.1% north in the same time frame. The favorable estimate revisions indicate brokers&rsquo; confidence in the stock.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Solid Rank: </strong>ATSG currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tailwinds:&nbsp;</strong>Declining operating expenses bode well for the company. In the second quarter of 2024, total operating expenses fell by 0.6% year over year. This decline was driven by a fall in labor, maintenance and fuel costs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ATSG&rsquo;s labor costs, comprising salaries, wages and benefits, accounting for 36% of the total operating expenses, fell by 3.7% year over year. Expenses on maintenance, materials and repair fell by 7.4% year over year, and fuel costs declined by 2.5%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expanded agreement with <strong>Amazon</strong> AMZN is a major tailwind for ATSG. Starting this summer, Air Transport Services will operate 10 Boeing 767-300 freighters provided by Amazon, with the potential for 10 more aircraft. The company raised its 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million to around $516 million, expecting increased flying opportunities from these aircraft.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The expansion of Air Transport Services&rsquo; fleet is promising. At the end of 2022, ATSG had a total of 128 aircraft in service (18 passengers and 110 freighters), up from 117 at the end of 2021. By the end of 2023, the fleet size increased to 129 aircraft (18 passenger planes and 111 freighters). The company expects to end 2024 with 139 aircraft in service, including 129 freighters and 20 passenger planes.</p><h2><strong>Other Stocks to Consider</strong></h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other top-ranked stocks for investors&rsquo; consideration in the Zacks Transportation&nbsp;sector include <strong>C.H. Robinson Worldwide</strong> CHRW and <strong>Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies</strong> WAB.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">C.H. Robinson Worldwide currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;CHRW has an expected earnings growth rate of 25.2% for the current year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an average surprise of 7.3%. Shares of CHRW have risen 10% in the past year.<br /><br />WAB holds a Zacks Rank #2 at present and has an expected earnings growth rate of 26% for the current year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company has an encouraging track record with respect to the earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters. The average beat is 11.8%. Shares of WAB have climbed 47.2% in the past year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327709/here-s-why-you-should-invest-in-air-transport-services-stock-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2327709">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Consumer Demand Melts Higher for These 3 Companies: DECK, SHOO, BIRK ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>We&rsquo;ve seen somewhat mixed reads on the state of the consumer this year, with big-ticket discretionary items continuing to face a demand cooldown while other general merchandise categories, such as apparel, have primarily remained intact for a fair share of companies.</p><p>Specifically, several footwear-centric apparel companies have enjoyed strong gains over the past year, a list that includes Steve Madden SHOO, Birkenstock BIRK, and Deckers Outdoor DECK. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last year, with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector blended in as a benchmark.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/1b/75487.jpg?v=1114780773" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at what&rsquo;s been driving the positivity.</p><h2><strong>Birkenstock Posts Record Sales</strong></h2><p>Birkenstock has undergone significant changes in recent years, expanding its product catalog nicely. It recently enjoyed a notably strong period, posting record Q2 sales that grew more than 20% year-over-year.</p><p>As a result of the robust demand, BIRK upped its full-year revenue guidance to 20%, with investors also raising their expectations accordingly post-earnings. The stock currently sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><p>As shown below, the sales revisions trend for its FY24 has been positive since the beginning of 2024, up a staggering 25% since. The company has overall been witnessing a demand snowball, reporting strong consumer demand across all its categories, channels, and segments throughout the above-mentioned period.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/7a/75488.jpg?v=713148564" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that the company&rsquo;s earnings outlook also shot higher alongside sales expectations, with the $1.40 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up nearly 6% over the last year and seeing a big boost starting back in May.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/41/75489.jpg?v=373960856" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><strong>Steve Madden Reports Robust Sales Growth</strong></h2><p>Steve Madden, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), also recently delivered a favorable quarterly release, posting an 11% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and reporting sales nearly 4% ahead of the consensus. EPS saw a 21% increase, whereas sales shot nearly 20% higher from the year-ago period.</p><p>The company&rsquo;s top line has recovered nicely over recent periods, with SHOO posting double-digit percentage year-over-year sales growth rates in each of its last three quarters. The sales outlook for its current fiscal year has remained bullish over the last year, with the $2.2 billion expected up nearly 9% across the period.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/bb/75490.jpg?v=213391840" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>In addition, Steve Madden&rsquo;s margins have been consistently stable over recent years, as shown in the trailing twelve-month chart below. Operational efficiencies have aided its profitability picture, with key strategic initiatives also providing tailwinds.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/f0/75491.jpg?v=1591487982" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The company maintained its current year outlook following the results, still expecting annual sales growth in a band of 11% - 13% relative to FY23. Shares could also interest income-focused investors, currently yielding 1.9% annually compared to the Zacks Consumer Discretionary average of 0.9%.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/5a/75492.jpg?v=943212165" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><strong>Deckers Outdoor Brand Momentum Continues</strong></h2><p>Deckers Outdoor, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), recently enjoyed a strong quarter, beating both earnings and revenue expectations handily. Big growth was delivered, with EPS growing a staggering 90% year-over-year alongside a 22% increase in sales. &nbsp;</p><p>Continued brand momentum among UGG and Hoka shoes aided the favorable quarter, leading the company to up its current fiscal year outlook. Analysts have updated their outlook for the company&rsquo;s current fiscal year accordingly following the print, with the $31.58 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/4c/75493.jpg?v=1848150914" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The company has also been enjoying margin expansion, brightening its profitability picture nicely. It enjoyed the same throughout its latest release, with its gross margin expanding to 56.9% vs 51.3% in the year-ago period.</p><p>Please note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/43/75494.jpg?v=1106130905" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><p>While we&rsquo;ve seen pockets of consumer weakness, it certainly hasn&rsquo;t been broad-based, reflected by results we&rsquo;ve gotten from several consumer-facing companies &ndash; Steve Madden SHOO, Birkenstock BIRK, and Deckers Outdoor DECK.</p><p>Still, other big names, such as Nike, haven&rsquo;t experienced the same positivity among consumers, raising some questions among investors. All in all, the Cons. Discretionary names that have been truly firing on all cylinders, enjoying robust consumer demand, have been aided by remarkable management teams.</p><p>On the flip side, those struggling have failed to meet consumers&rsquo; ever-changing needs and wants, reflected by slowing sales.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2327355/consumer-demand-melts-higher-for-these-3-companies-deck-shoo-birk?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-investment_ideas-2327355">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Dow Jones Outperforms: 5 ETFs That You Can Bet On ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 14:10:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new record high on increased September rate cut bets. The blue-chip index gained about 1% over the past week, outperforming the other indices. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.3% while the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.5% in the same time frame.<br /><br />Investors seeking to participate in the Dow Jones rally can consider SPDR <strong>Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF </strong>DIA, <strong>iShares Dow Jones U.S. ETF </strong>IYY, <strong>Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF</strong> DJD, <strong>ProShares Ultra Dow30 ETF</strong> DDM and <strong>ProShares UltraPro Dow30 </strong>UDOW.<br /><br />The solid trend is likely to continue in the coming months. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that interest rate cuts are coming in September, citing inflation is easing and the job market is weakening. At the Fed&rsquo;s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Powell said, &ldquo;the time has come&rdquo; to lower borrowing costs in the light of a diminishing upside risk to inflation and moderating labor demand.&rdquo; &ldquo;The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.&rdquo; The probability of a 25-bps rate cut stands at 69.5%, while that of a 50-bps cut is at 30.5%, according to the latest CME Group&#39;s FedWatch tool (read: 5 Sector ETFs Scaling New Highs on Fed Minutes).<br /><br />Lower rates primarily benefit cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and consumer discretionary. Being highly exposed to cyclical sectors, the blue-chip index is set to outperform from this trend. Lower rates generally lead to reduced borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards and other consumer and business loans. This helps businesses to expand their operations more easily, resulting in increased profitability. This, in turn, stimulates economic growth and boosts the stock market.&nbsp;<br /><br />Additionally, fading AI trades are taking a toll on the most loving technology sector, benefiting the undervalued cyclical sectors.</p><h3>5 Dow ETFs to Bet On Following the Outperformance</h3><p><strong>SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA)&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF is one of the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space, with an AUM of $34.8 billion and an average daily volume of 3 million shares. Holding 30 blue-chip stocks, the fund is widely spread across components, with each having less than a 9.3% share. Financials (23.4%), healthcare (19%), information technology (18.7%), consumer discretionary (14.8%) and industrials (13.7%) are the top five sectors.&nbsp;<br /><br />SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF charges 16 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk (read: Dow Jone ETFs at an All-Time High: Here&#39;s Why).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>iShares Dow Jones U.S. ETF (IYY)</strong><br /><br />iShares Dow Jones U.S. ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Index, holding 1075 stocks in its basket, with none accounting for more than 6.3% of the assets. Information technology takes the largest share at 30.5%, while financials, healthcare and consumer discretionary round off the next spots with double-digit exposure each.&nbsp;<br /><br />iShares Dow Jones U.S. ETF has amassed $2 million in its asset base while trading in an average daily volume of 24,000 shares. It charges 20 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.<br /><br /><strong>Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF (DJD)</strong><br /><br />Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF offers exposure to dividend-paying companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average by their 12-month dividend yield over the prior 12 months. It holds 29 stocks in its basket, with none accounting for more than 12.2% of the assets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Invesco Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF has been able to manage assets worth $305.1 million while trading in a volume of 20,000 shares a day on average. It charges 7 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).</p><h3>Leveraged Play: A Short-Term Win</h3><p>Investors willing to take an extra risk could go for leveraged ETFs. These funds create a leveraged (2X or 3X) long position in the underlying index through the use of swaps, options, future contracts and other financial instruments. While these funds provide outsized returns in a short span, they could lead to huge losses compared to traditional funds in fluctuating or seesaw markets.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>ProShares Ultra Dow30 ETF (DDM)</strong><br /><br />ProShares Ultra Dow30 ETF provides twice (2X) the return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It has AUM of $400.8 million and trades in a good volume of around 270,000 shares on average. The product charges 95 bps in annual fees (see: all the Leveraged Equity ETFs here).&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>ProShares UltraPro Dow30 (UDOW)</strong><br /><br />ProShares UltraPro Dow30 also tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average, offering three times (3X) exposure to the index. It has amassed $610.8 million in its asset base and trades in a solid average daily volume of 4 million shares. The expense ratio comes in at 0.95%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327714/dow-jones-outperforms-5-etfs-that-you-can-bet-on?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2327714">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Columbia Financial Inc.</strong> CLBK announced that it has received all regulatory approvals from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to complete Freehold Bank&rsquo;s merger into the company. The transaction and system integration are anticipated to be completed on Oct. 5, 2024, subject to customary closing requirements.<br /><br />Despite the favorable strategic move, shares of CLBK declined 1.5% yesterday due to subdued broader market sentiments.</p><h2>CLBK&rsquo;s Freehold Acquisition Details</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Columbia Financial announced the acquisition of Freehold Bancorp, MHC, Freehold Bancorp, Inc. and Freehold Bank in June 2021, which was completed in December 2021.<br /><br />Freehold Bank, founded in 1853, is a community-oriented institution serving the financial requirements of depositors and the local community through its two offices in Freehold and New Jersey.<br /><br />Upon the completion of the deal, Freehold Bank became a federal savings bank from a federal stock savings bank and currently operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbia Financial.</p><h2>Rationale Behind Columbia Financial&rsquo;s Merger Pursuit</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per the merger agreement, depositors of Freehold Bank will become depositors of Columbia Bank and will enjoy the same rights and privileges in the Freehold MHC, upon the completion of the merger of both entities.<br /><br />This move is in line with CLBK&rsquo;s efforts to address the financial needs of its customers and offer an enhanced service through streamlined functioning and operational integration.</p><h2>CLBK&rsquo;s Past Buyouts</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Columbia Financial has been engaged in strategic acquisitions to expand its footprint and market share. In May 2022, the company acquired RSI and merged its depositors into Columbia Bank. In April 2020, CLBK purchased Roselle Entities while completing the acquisition of Stewardship Financial in November 2019.<br /><br />Year to date, shares of Columbia Financial have lost 8.8% against the industry&rsquo;s 5.9% growth.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b5/75538.jpg?v=937794036" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Currently, CLBK carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><h2>Similar Steps by Other Financial Services Firms</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this month, <strong>State Street Corporation</strong>&rsquo;s STT asset management unit, State Street Global Advisors, announced an investment in a leading Australian fintech platform, Raiz Invest Limited, which allows customers to grow their wealth by helping them save and invest.<br /><br />As part of the equity investment agreement, State Street Global Advisors will acquire 5% of Raiz&rsquo;s share capital through a placement.<br /><br />Through this partnership, State Street Global Advisors&rsquo; trusted brand and deep knowledge of markets will come together with Raiz&rsquo;s mobile-first platform, which will help retail investors in Australia with micro-investments primarily in exchange-traded funds and model portfolios.<br /><br /><strong>U.S. Bancorp</strong>&rsquo;s USB lead banking division, U.S. Bank, expanded its focus on the healthcare industry with the acquisition of Salucro Healthcare Solutions LLC. The buyout was completed on Aug. 21, 2024. The financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.<br /><br />Based in Tempe, AZ, Salucro is a provider of healthcare financial technology with a primary focus on patient payments and billing. Previously, Salucro had been a partner of Elavon, a subsidiary of U.S. Bank. In 2022, U.S. Bank made its initial investment in Salucro and its platform was sold through Elavon as MedEpay.<br /><br />The acquisition of Salucro extends U.S. Bank&#39;s more than a century of service to healthcare-focused clientele. Following the acquisition, Salucro&rsquo;s employees have now become part of U.S. Bank and will be integrated into Elavon, one of the largest global payments processing firms.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327697/columbia-financial-gets-regulatory-nod-to-merge-freehold-bank?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_finance_sector-2327697">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Equinor Plans $6.7B Annual Offshore Investment Until 2035 ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 14:04:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Equinor ASA</strong> EQNR, a Norwegian energy giant, announced a significant investment plan in oil and natural gas projects offshore Norway. The company intends to invest 60-70 billion Norwegian crowns (approximately $5.7-$6.7 billion) annually until 2035. This substantial commitment was made despite the global push for cleaner energy sources and the declining production from many of Norway&#39;s offshore fields.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Investment Focus on Norway&#39;s Offshore Potential</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Anders Opedal, CEO of Equinor, revealed the investment plan at a recent press event, emphasizing the company&#39;s belief in strong, long-term demand for Norwegian oil. Equinor plans to continue its aggressive exploration strategy, drilling between 20 and 30 exploration wells each year over the next decade (compared to 26 drilled in 2012).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company aims to maintain a production level of 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) by 2035, slightly down from 1.4 million boe/d produced in 2023. This strategic move underscores Equinor&#39;s commitment to maximizing Norway&#39;s oil and gas resources despite the natural decline in some of its existing fields and the absence of new major developments planned for the 2030s.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Sustained Gas Supply to Europe</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">As Europe&rsquo;s largest gas supplier and a significant oil producer, Norway plays a critical role in the continent&#39;s energy security. Currently, the country pumps around 4 million boe/d. Equinor&#39;s investment plan includes a commitment to deliver approximately 40 billion cubic meters of gas to Europe each year until 2035. This steady supply is crucial for Europe, especially in light of the ongoing energy transition and geopolitical tensions that have threatened the stability of global energy markets.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry-Wide Investment Surge</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The announcement by Equinor coincides with a broader trend of increased investment in Norway&#39;s offshore oil and gas sector. Per a Reuters report citing data from the National Statistics Office, oil and gas investments offshore Norway by all companies are expected to reach a record high this year and remain at that level through 2025. This investment boom is attributed to ongoing field development activities and rising inflation, which have increased the cost of operations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Kjetil Hove, Equinor&rsquo;s head of domestic operations, highlighted the continued attractiveness of opportunities offshore Norway.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Navigating the Future of Energy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Equinor&#39;s long-term investment strategy reflects its confidence in the enduring demand for fossil fuels, even as the world shifts toward renewable energy. The company&rsquo;s focus on sustaining oil and gas production in Norway aligns with its broader goal of balancing economic growth, energy security and environmental responsibility.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Equinor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the&nbsp;energy&nbsp;sector may look at some better-ranked stocks like <strong>SM Energy</strong> <strong>Company</strong> SM, <strong>MPLX LP&nbsp;</strong>MPLX and <strong>TechnipFMC plc </strong>FTI. While SM Energy currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), MPLX and TechnipFMC carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">SM Energy is set to expand its oil-centered operations in the coming years with an increasing focus on crude oil, especially in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford regions. The company&rsquo;s attractive oil and gas investments should create long-term value for its shareholders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SM&rsquo;s 2024 EPS is pegged at $7.57. The company has a Zacks Style Score of A for Value. It has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 in the past seven days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">MPLX derives stable fee-based revenues from long-term contracts, with minimal exposure to commodity-price fluctuations. The partnership&rsquo;s robust capital expenditure forecast for 2024, along with significant expansion initiatives, underscores its commitment to sustainable growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MPLX&rsquo;s 2024 EPS is pegged at $4.21. The company has a Zacks Style Score of B for Value. It has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 in the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TechnipFMC is a leading manufacturer and supplier of products, services and fully integrated technology solutions for the energy industry, with a focus on the subsea segment in offshore basins worldwide. FTI&rsquo;s growing backlog ensures strong revenue visibility and supports margin improvements.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FTI&rsquo;s 2024 EPS is pegged at $1.25. The company has a Zacks Style Score of B for Value. It has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2024 and 2025 in the past 30 days.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327762/equinor-plans-6-7b-annual-offshore-investment-until-2035?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_energy_sector-2327762">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dril-Quip, Inc. </strong>DRQ and Innovex Downhole Solutions, Inc. have announced a significant change in their proposed merger plan. The two companies have agreed to waive the requirement for Dril-Quip&rsquo;s stockholders to approve an amendment to the company&rsquo;s restated certificate of incorporation, also known as the charter amendment, as a condition for completing the merger.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Key Decisions on Charter Amendment Proposal</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In a joint statement, Dril-Quip and Innovex confirmed that they will withdraw the charter amendment proposal (Proposal No. 2) and the related non-binding governance proposals (Proposal Nos. 3A &ndash; F) from the agenda of Dril-Quip&rsquo;s upcoming special stockholders meeting scheduled for Sept. 5, 2024. The withdrawn proposals pertained to post-merger governance provisions that some stockholders found contentious.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This change implies that Dril-Quip&rsquo;s stockholders will no longer need to vote on these proposals, as outlined in the company&rsquo;s proxy statement/prospectus dated Aug. 6, 2024. By removing these governance provisions from the conditions of the merger, Dril-Quip and Innovex aim to facilitate a smoother path to closing the merger.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Responding to Shareholder Feedback</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">John V. Lovoi, Dril-Quip&rsquo;s chairman of the board, indicated that the decision to withdraw the charter amendment proposal was induced by feedback from shareholders. Extensive discussions revealed that while investors recognized the strategic benefits of the merger with Innovex, they also had concerns about some governance provisions in the charter amendment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lovoi highlighted Dril-Quip&#39;s commitment to strong corporate governance and responsiveness to shareholder input. To address these concerns, the company collaborated with Innovex and its controlling stockholders to remove the contentious governance provisions.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Merger Remains on Track</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the withdrawal of the charter amendment proposal, the proposed merger between Dril-Quip and Innovex remains on track. Both companies reaffirmed their commitment to completing the merger, emphasizing the strategic benefits and value that it is expected to create for all stakeholders.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a nutshell, Dril-Quip and Innovex&#39;s decision to waive the charter amendment requirement is a strategic move to ensure the smooth progression of their proposed merger. By listening to shareholders&rsquo; feedback and removing controversial governance provisions, the companies have demonstrated their commitment to both corporate governance and creating value for stakeholders.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Dril-Quip currently carries a Zack Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Investors interested in the&nbsp;energy&nbsp;sector may look at some better-ranked stocks like <strong>SM Energy</strong> <strong>Company</strong> SM, <strong>MPLX LP&nbsp;</strong>MPLX and <strong>TechnipFMC plc </strong>FTI.

<![CDATA[ Canada Joins US & EU Bandwagon to Slap Tariffs on China EVs ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">In a significant escalation of trade tensions, Canada has joined the United States and the European Union in imposing steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). This move, which includes a 100% tariff on China-made EVs and a 25% duty on Chinese steel and aluminum, marks Canada&#39;s latest effort to protect its domestic industries from the perceived threat of low-cost imports.</p><h2>The Global Tariff War Against Chinese EVs</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Canada&#39;s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs is part of a broader international trend aimed at curbing China&#39;s growing influence in the global automotive market. The United States set a precedent in May by raising its border tax on Chinese EVs from 25% to 100%, citing concerns over price undercutting and the need to safeguard domestic jobs. Following suit, the European Union announced plans to increase tariffs on Chinese EVs, with some models facing additional duties of up to 38% on top of the existing 10% tariff.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The rationale behind these actions is rooted in accusations that China is unfairly subsidizing its EV industry, giving its automakers an edge over competitors in other markets. By imposing these tariffs, Canada and its Western allies aim to level the playing field, protecting their domestic markets from an influx of inexpensive imports that could undermine local industries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Canada&#39;s tariffs on Chinese EVs will take effect on Oct. 1, with duties on steel and aluminum following on Oct. 15.</p><h2>Surge in Chinese EV Imports: A Growing Concern</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Canada&#39;s move comes in response to a dramatic surge in Chinese EV imports. In 2023, the value of these imports skyrocketed to C$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion), up from less than C$100 million in 2022.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Canadian government, led by Justin Trudeau, has responded by not only imposing tariffs but also investing heavily in domestic EV production. The government has struck multibillion-dollar deals with major automakers such as <strong>Stellantis </strong>STLA, <strong>Volkswagen</strong> VWAGY and <strong>Honda</strong> HMC to establish EV plants and battery factories in Canada. These moves are part of a broader strategy to position Canada as a key player in the global EV industry, while also protecting domestic jobs from the impact of cheaper Chinese imports.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Canadian steel and aluminum producers have also consistently called on the government to limit China&#39;s access. They argue that China&rsquo;s industrial policies allow it to flood foreign markets with cheap products, threatening local jobs and wages.</p><h2>Tariff Impact on Tesla and Other Automakers</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The new tariffs will have a broad impact, affecting not only Chinese automakers like <strong>BYD Co Ltd</strong> BYDDY, which plans to enter Canada by 2025 but also global companies that manufacture vehicles in China. One such company is the EV pioneer <strong>Tesla</strong> TSLA, which produces EVs at its Shanghai factory for export to various markets, including Canada.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the imposition of these tariffs, Tesla may need to reconsider its logistics and supply chain strategies, potentially shifting production to other locations to avoid the increased costs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, while the European Union imposed tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, it softened its stance toward Tesla, imposing a lower tariff rate of 9% compared to the up to 36.3% levied on other Chinese EV imports.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TSLA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><h2>China&rsquo;s Response and the Risk of Retaliation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Unsurprisingly, China has condemned Canada&#39;s decision, labeling it as &quot;trade protectionism&quot; and accusing Canada of violating World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. In a statement, China&rsquo;s embassy in Canada defended the competitiveness of its EV industry, attributing its success to technological innovation, robust supply chains and market competition rather than government subsidies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The potential for retaliation from China looms large, as Canada must now brace for possible economic repercussions. China is Canada&#39;s second-largest trading partner, and any retaliatory measures could have significant impacts on Canadian exporters.</p><h2>Last Word</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">By aligning with the United States and the European Union, Canada is taking a stand against what it perceives as unfair trade practices by China. However, this move comes with risks, as it could provoke retaliation from China and strain economic relations between the two countries.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327694/canada-joins-us-eu-bandwagon-to-slap-tariffs-on-china-evs?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|industry_focus-2327694">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Quest Diagnostics Expands in North America With New Acquisition ]]>
</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Quest&nbsp;Diagnostics&nbsp;</strong>DGX recently announced the completion of its acquisition&nbsp;of LifeLabs from OMERS. The transaction was valued at approximately $1 billion, including net debt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The latest acquisition is aimed at enhancing access to diagnostic innovation for patients in&nbsp;North America.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Significance of LifeLabs Acquisition for DGX&rsquo;s Business</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The combination of LifeLabs&#39; strong business and deep community presence with Quest Diagnostics&rsquo; specialized lab services and expertise creates an opportunity to generate growth. The acquisition should help improve care and outcomes for&nbsp;Canada&#39;s&nbsp;expanding and aging population.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quest Diagnostics will provide LifeLabs with new expertise, innovations and resources to strengthen the services provided by the latter. In addition to fostering greater access to specialized tests, the two companies will work together to improve online appointment scheduling and accelerate patient service center processing. DGX will also support LifeLabs&#39; data security enhancements while ensuring that Canadian patients&#39; health data remain in&nbsp;Canada.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DGX expects the acquisition to generate approximately $710 million in annual revenues. The company anticipates the transaction to be slightly dilutive to GAAP earnings per share (EPS), primarily due to the amortization of intangibles and other items, but&nbsp;$0.10-$0.15&nbsp;accretive to adjusted EPS in the first 12 months after closing.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Details of the Acquisition</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Quest Diagnostics has acquired 100% of the equity of LifeLabs. The transaction meets all of DGX&rsquo;s criteria on growth, profitability and returns. Post-acquisition, LifeLabs&rsquo; more than 6,500 employees will continue to operate under the LifeLabs brand and with the same management team and headquarters.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The transaction represents a significant achievement for OMERS and its members.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">McCarthy T&eacute;trault LLP served as legal advisor to Quest Diagnostics. Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon LLP served as a legal advisor to OMERS. Evercore and CIBC Capital Markets served as financial advisors to OMERS.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/a6/75542.jpg?v=1427236417" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Industry Prospects in Favor of DGX</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Per a Market Research Future report, the global Clinical Laboratory Services market was valued at $252.36 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $355.94 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 3.9% during the period. Primary factors boosting market growth include a rising number of advancements in quick &amp; inescapable testing and increasing frequencies of ongoing illnesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quest Diagnostics&rsquo; latest acquisition turns out to be in favor of market growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Recent Developments by Quest Diagnostics</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this month, Quest Diagnostics signed a definitive agreement to acquire select assets of University Hospitals&#39; outreach laboratory services business. The transaction should help the company to broaden its access in&nbsp;Ohio to provide its innovative test menu, network of convenient patient access sites and broad health plan coverage.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In July 2024, Quest Diagnostics and Becton, Dickinson and Company announced a global collaboration agreement to develop, manufacture and commercialize flow cytometry-based companion diagnostics (CDx). This is intended to help select the best treatment for patients with cancer and other diseases.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Price Performance of DGX</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of DGX have risen 16.2% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s 10.4% growth.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank and Other Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">DGX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are <strong>Intuitive Surgical</strong> ISRG, <strong>TransMedics Group </strong>TMDX and <strong>Boston Scientific </strong>BSX. While Intuitive Surgical and TransMedics sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, Boston Scientific currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Intuitive Surgical&rsquo;s shares have surged 58.9% in the past year. Estimates for the company&rsquo;s earnings have remained constant at $6.67 per share for 2024 in the past 30 days.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ISRG&rsquo;s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 8.97%. In the last reported quarter, it posted an earnings surprise of 16.34%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Estimates for TransMedics&rsquo; 2024 earnings per share (EPS) have moved up 48.1% to $1.20 in the past 30 days. Shares of the company have risen 178.7% in the past year compared with the industry&rsquo;s 10.5% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TMDX&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 287.50%.

<![CDATA[ Boeing's China Prospects Bright: Should You Buy the Stock Now? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Boeing Company </strong>BA recently released its 2024 Commercial Market Outlook (&ldquo;CMO&rdquo;) for China, wherein the company expects the nation&rsquo;s commercial fleet to grow 4.1% annually during 2023-2043. This reflects a remarkable growth opportunity for the American jet giant, with Boeing being the largest customer of China&#39;s aviation manufacturing industry.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Notably, air travel in China is projected to become the world&#39;s largest traffic flow over the next 20 years. This surely should benefit Boeing&rsquo;s prospects in this country, with the company&rsquo;s activity in China contributing more than $1.5 billion annually in direct support of the nation&rsquo;s economy.</p><h2>Boeing-China Partnership</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Boeing and China have been in a solid partnership for a long time. Since 1973, Boeing has delivered more than 2,000 airplanes to China&rsquo;s airlines and leasing companies, thereby making the nation the biggest market for Boeing aircraft outside the United States.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, while China has a component role in every current Boeing commercial airplane model, more than 10,000 Boeing airplanes fly worldwide with Chinese parts and assemblies. &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So, while China benefits from receiving the world-class commercial fleet and aviation services of Boeing, the latter enjoys the perk of procuring low-priced aircraft parts from China compared to the United States.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">With the latest CMO projecting China to have the world&#39;s largest widebody fleet and Chinese carriers estimated to demand for aviation services worth $780 billion, Boeing&rsquo;s long-standing partnership with this nation should help the jet maker to reclaim its superiority in the commercial aerospace market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Notably, Boeing&rsquo;s commercial airplane business has been delivering poor performance for quite some time now, with two of its major commercial jet models, 737 and 787, suffering from multiple critical challenges, with quality control issues being significant among those.</p><h2>Boeing&rsquo;s YTD Performance</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Boeing&rsquo;s shares in the bourses have been staggering for quite some time due to persistent quality control issues with one of its major commercial programs, along with some critical challenges posed by the commercial aerospace industry. Evidently, shares of America&rsquo;s largest passenger aircraft maker have lost 33.5% year to date, underperforming the Zacks aerospace-defense industry, the broader Zacks Aerospace sector, as well as the S&amp;P 500.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/6e/75546.jpg?v=819115205" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company also lagged the year-to-date performance of two key commercial jet makers,<strong> Embraer</strong> ERJ and <strong>Textron </strong>TXT, whose shares surged 82.6% and 12%, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, a company&rsquo;s share price performance is not the only parameter one should consider while investing. Considering the fact that Boeing still remains one of the world&rsquo;s two major jet makers, the other one being <strong>Airbus</strong> EADSY, a prudent investor must take into account other aspects of the company like its profitability, earnings prospects and risks (if any) to investment.</p><h2>Dismal ROIC</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The stock&rsquo;s trailing 12-month return on invested capital (ROIC) not only lags the industry&rsquo;s return but also reflects a negative figure. This indicates that the company&#39;s investments are not generating sufficient returns to cover its costs.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d6/75547.jpg?v=1460023238" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Risks One Should Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">737 Max remains a major challenge that has been persistently affecting Boeing&rsquo;s commercial airplane business. In the latest development on this issue, in the second quarter of 2024, revenues from its commercial airplane segment suffered a 32% year-over-year plunge, with lower 737 deliveries being a key driving factor. The company also suffered major cancellations in its aircraft orders, primarily concerning the quality control issues for its 737 jets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to such internal issues, industry challenges like shortage of skilled labor and steadily rising fuel prices pose a threat to Boeing, especially to its commercial airplane division. Moreover, due to persistent supply-chain challenges, aircraft manufacturers as well as aerospace parts suppliers are struggling to keep up with the soaring demand, thereby limiting the potential for timely delivery of finished aircraft.</p><h2>Will the BA Stock Continue to Lag or Recover?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite facing the near-term challenges, Boeing&rsquo;s long-run prospects remain bright. The fact that BA also enjoys a solid presence in the defense and space markets provides it with a solid product diversity.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Also, the impressively growing aviation services market offers notable growth opportunities to the company. To this end, Boeing expects a $4.4-trillion market opportunity for commercial aviation support and services over the next 20 years. This should bode well for its global services business unit over the long run, with a total backlog of $19.49 billion as of June 30, 2024.</p><h2>Upbeat Estimates</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">A quick sneak peek at BA&rsquo;s 2024 and 2025 earnings estimates mirrors an annual improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at a loss of $4.26 per share, which indicates a solid improvement from the prior-year reported loss of $5.81. The 2025 estimate also reflects similar growth.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/4c/75556.jpg?v=1838499920" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Trading at a Discount</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of valuation, BA&rsquo;s forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) is 1.24X, a discount to the industry&rsquo;s average of 1.58X. This suggests that investors will be paying a lower price than the company&#39;s expected sales growth compared to that for its industry&rsquo;s average. The stock is also trading lower than its five-year median of 1.43.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/b7/75550.jpg?v=1605303811" /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Should You Make an Entry Now?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">To summarize, despite the solid earnings growth potential for Boeing and the company trading at a discount, it is not advisable for investors to buy this stock right now. One should wait for a better entry point, considering BA&rsquo;s poor ROIC as well as persistent quality control issues associated with its 737 program.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, those who already own it may continue to do so, taking into account Boeing&rsquo;s product diversity, upbeat earnings estimate and solid growth opportunities in aviation services.&nbsp; The company&rsquo;s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) further supports our thesis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327761/boeing-s-china-prospects-bright-should-you-buy-the-stock-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2327761">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Shell's Zydeco Pipeline to Undergo Maintenance in September ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:58:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Shell plc&nbsp;</strong>SHEL, the British energy major, has stated that it will shut down certain parts of its Zydeco pipeline system to conduct maintenance activities. The shutdown, which is expected to last for three to four days, beginning Sept. 24, 2024, will likely restrict the flow of some light crude to Louisiana.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per Shell Midstream Partners, the Zydeco pipeline eases transportation bottlenecks for the crude that arrives in Houston from the prolific Eagle Ford shale, and the Permian and Bakken regions. The shutdown may restrict the supply of light crude to Louisiana.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The crude includes Bakken crude, West Texas Light and West Texas Intermediate (&ldquo;WTI&rdquo;), which are further converted into the Light Louisiana Sweet (&ldquo;LLS&rdquo;) blend. The pipeline also transports Poseidon crude from Houma, inland to the crude hub at St. James. The St. James crude hub connects to several oil refineries.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zydeco pipeline spans more than 350 miles and has the capacity to transport about 375,000 barrels per day. The pipeline has four segments and plays a critical role in moving crude oil from Houston, TX, to St. James, LA.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank and Key Picks</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, SHEL carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the energysector are&nbsp;<strong>SM Energy</strong> SM, <strong>TechnipFMC plc </strong>FTI and&nbsp;<strong>MPLX LP </strong>MPLX.

<![CDATA[ Merck Stock Worth Watching on PAH Drug Winrevair's Approval in Europe? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:57:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Merck </strong>MRK announced that the European Commission has granted approval to its novel activin signaling inhibitor, Winrevair (sotatercept), for treating adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Winrevair can now be prescribed to treat PAH in adult patients with World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class (FC) II to III in the EU in&nbsp;combination with other&nbsp;PAH therapies. Winrevair becomes the first novel activin signaling inhibitor therapy approved in Europe to treat PAH.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The approval was based on data from the STELLAR study. In the study, Winrevair plus background therapy&nbsp;significantly improved exercise capacity, increasing the six-minute walk distance by 40.8 meters from baseline at week 24, the study&rsquo;s primary endpoint. Moreover, Winrevair demonstrated statistically significant improvements in eight out of nine secondary outcome measures, including a reduction in the risk of clinical worsening or death.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Winrevair was approved by the FDA to treat PAH, WHO Group 1&nbsp;in March this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Merck&rsquo;s stock has risen 6.7% so far this year compared with an increase of 27.4% for the industry.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/10/75507.jpg?v=1656132353" style="height: 310px; width: 600px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">PAH is a rare, progressive blood vessel disorder that affects the blood vessel walls in the lungs, resulting in elevated blood pressure. It exerts significant strain on the heart, as it works harder to pump blood through the lungs, eventually leading to heart failure if left untreated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Winrevair is designed to target cellular signaling associated with vascular hyperproliferation and pathological remodeling to treat PAH. Winrevair works by blocking the proteins that contribute to the thickening of blood vessel walls in the lung.</p><h2>MRK Pins Hopes on Winrevair Ahead of Keytruda&rsquo;s Loss of Patent</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the second quarter, Winrevair recorded sales of $70 million from the U.S. market. On the conference call, the company said that the U.S. launch of the drug is progressing well. Approximately 40% of sales were due to doses administered to patients and the remainder were due to inventory building. Sales were above investor expectations. The approval in Europe should boost sales further in the second half of the year. Merck believes that Winrevair has the potential to generate significant revenues over the long term. Merck is pinning hopes on Winrevair to boost its top line once its blockbuster drug, Keytruda loses patent exclusivity in 2028.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Merck is also evaluating sotatercept in patients with more advanced disease in the phase III ZENITH and HYPERION studies.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Merck added Winrevair following its $11 billion acquisition of Acceleron Pharma in 2021.</p><h2>Other Players in PAH Market</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Significant players in the PAH market are <strong>United Therapeutics</strong> UTHR and <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong> JNJ. United Therapeutics markets four drugs to treat PAH in the United States &mdash; Remodulin, Orenitram, Tyvaso and Adcirca.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Remodulin is an injectable formulation of treprostinil. Orenitram is an oral version of treprostinil, while Tyvaso is an inhaled version of Treprostinil. Remodulin, Orenitram and Tyvaso recorded sales of $275.3 million, $213.3 million and $770.7 million, respectively, in the first half of 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As far as J&amp;J is concerned, the PAH franchise was added to its portfolio with the 2017 acquisition of Actelion. J&amp;J&rsquo;s key PAH drugs are Opsumit and Uptravi. J&amp;J recorded revenues of $2.09 billion from its PAH franchise in the first half of 2024, up 13.2% year over year.</p><h2>Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Merck has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) currently.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Merck &amp; Co., Inc. Price and Consensus</h3> <img alt="Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

You can see&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Estimates for Lilly&rsquo;s 2024 earnings have risen from $13.76 to $15.77 per share over the past 30 days. For 2025, earnings estimates have risen from $19.44 to $22.79 per share over the same timeframe. Year to date, Lilly&rsquo;s stock has risen 63.1%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Lilly beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, delivering a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 69.07%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327685/merck-stock-worth-watching-on-pah-drug-winrevair-s-approval-in-europe?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_medical_sector-2327685">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Reasons to Retain Fresenius Medical Stock in Your Portfolio Now ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. KGaA </strong>FMS is well-poised for growth on the back of a broad range of dialysis products and services, and a solid global foothold. However, stiff competition remains a concern.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 5.6% year to date against the industry&rsquo;s growth of 9.4%. The S&amp;P 500 Index has increased 18.2% in the same time frame.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company, with a market capitalization of $11.41 billion, is one of the largest integrated providers of products and services for individuals undergoing dialysis following chronic kidney failure. Its bottom line is anticipated to improve 12.4% over the next five years. FMS&rsquo; earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, missed the same in one and met in another, delivering an average surprise of 13.2%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/9e/75536.jpg?v=858535792" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Key Catalysts for FMS</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Fresenius Medical is a leading provider of dialysis and related services for individuals with renal diseases. It also provides other healthcare services, including value and risk-based care programs, pharmacy services, vascular specialty services and ambulatory treatment services.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the company manufactures and commercializes an extensive array of healthcare products, including hemodyalisis, peritoneal dialysis, acute dialysis, acute cardiopulmonary and apheresis products, and water treatment systems. FMS also manages its own dialysis clinics.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per a Fortune Business Insights&rsquo; report, the total market size of the global dialysis market was $95.22 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $181.16 billion in 2032, at a CAGR of 7.9%. This represents a significant growth opportunity for FMS.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company reports under two operating segments &mdash; Care Delivery (provides dialysis and value-based services) and Care Enablement (distributes health care products).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Care Enablement segment is likely to be a key top-line driver in the upcoming quarters on the back of positive pricing momentum. The organic 3% growth in the top line was majorly driven by improved pricing for healthcare products. The company&rsquo;s long-tern cost savings initiative, FME25, is also helping the segment to offset inflationary cost increases and negative foreign currency exchange effects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The FME25 program contributed 57 million euros in savings during the second quarter and is expected to save 100-150 million euros for full-year 2024. These estimated savings are likely to support margin expansion for the Care Enablement segment going forward.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. KGaA Price</h3> <img alt="Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. KGaA Price" height="251" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/06/1724762887.png" title="" width="584" /> <p>Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. KGaA price | Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. KGaA Quote</p></div><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, the company&rsquo;s initiatives in China, a key growing market for the company, are likely to support its growth momentum in the country. The restructuring of the sales channel and the mix of products done by FMS in the past few quarters has helped minimize the impact of the Chinese volume-based procurement program. The company has also localized production in China to gain entry in profitable market segments.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Care Delivery segment also represents a significant growth opportunity over the long term. The company&rsquo;s ongoing portfolio optimization plan buoys optimism. It is divesting its less-profitable, noncore and dilutive assets to focus on the expansion of its core and high-performing businesses. The segment continues to benefit from the rising demand for its value-based care business, reimbursement rate increases and a favorable per-payer mix.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s Hurting FMS?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Although Fresenius Medical&rsquo;s Care Delivery segment offers long-term growth opportunities, the segment is facing several macro challenges, which are impeding its sales growth. Meanwhile, the divestments, as part of its portfolio optimization plan, are resulting in loss of sales, further hurting growth, especially in international markets.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The same market treatment growth in the United States remained flat year over year during the second quarter. On its second-quarter earnings call, FMS stated that there is an elevated mortality rate amid extended influenza season and rising COVID cases. A continued mortality rate might hurt treatment volumes in the upcoming quarters.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The segment&rsquo;s margins are also under pressure as it continues to face rising labor expenses as well as higher costs of medical supplies. FMS estimates that higher wages and increased staffing requirements may lead to a three-percentage point increase in labor expenses for full-year 2024 compared to the previous year.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Estimate Trend for FMS</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $21.1 billion, indicating growth of 0.3% from the previous year&rsquo;s reported number. The consensus mark for earnings is pinned at $1.51 per share, implying growth of 8.6% from the year-ago level.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are&nbsp;<strong>DaVita&nbsp;</strong>DVA,&nbsp;<strong>Aspen Technology</strong> AZPN and&nbsp;<strong>Universal Health Services</strong> UHS, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DaVita has an estimated long-term growth rate of 17.5%. DVA&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 24.2%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DaVita&rsquo;s shares have risen 43.4% year to date compared with the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 14.3% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Aspen Technology has an estimated long-term growth rate of 13.1%. AZPN&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same twice, the average surprise being 4.24%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Aspen Technology have lost 4.2% year to date against the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 13.5% growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Universal Health Services has an estimated long-term growth rate of 19%. UHS&#39; earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 14.58%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s shares have risen 48.6% year to date compared with the&nbsp;industry&rsquo;s 39.7% growth.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327742/reasons-to-retain-fresenius-medical-stock-in-your-portfolio-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2327742">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Industrial ETF (IYJ) Hits New 52-Week High ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:56:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>For investors seeking momentum, <strong>iShares U.S. Industrials ETF </strong>IYJ is probably on the radar. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up 34.7% from its 52-week low price of $95.00/share.&nbsp;<br /><br />But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea of where it might be headed:</p><h2>IYJ in Focus</h2><p>iShares U.S. Industrials ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that produce goods used in construction and manufacturing. It has key holdings in capital goods and financial services. iShares U.S. Industrials ETF charges 40 basis points in annual fees (see: all the Financials ETFs here).</p><h2>Why the Move?</h2><p>The industrial corner of the broad U.S. stock market has been an area to watch, given the increased bet for rate cuts in September. Lower rates lead to reduced borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards and other consumer and business loans. This helps businesses to expand their operations more easily, resulting in increased profitability.</p><h2>More Gains Ahead?</h2><p>Currently, IYJ has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook, suggesting that the outperformance could continue in the months ahead. However, many spaces that make up this ETF have a strong Zacks Industry Rank. So, there is definitely some promise for those who want to ride this surging ETF a little further.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327686/industrial-etf-iyj-hits-new-52-week-high?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-etf_news_and_commentary-2327686">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ 4 Stocks to Buy From the Promising Manufacturing Electronics Industry ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:56:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry is poised for growth on the back of steady demand across the electronic services end market, increasing adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies and product innovation efforts. A surge in e-commerce activities is also likely to aid the industry&rsquo;s growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A slowdown in manufacturing activities and the contraction of new orders might continue to dent the performances of the industry players. <strong>Eaton Corporation plc</strong> ETN, <strong>Zurn Elkay Water Solutions Corporation</strong> ZWS, <strong>EnerSys </strong>ENS and <strong>Powell Industries, Inc.</strong> POWL are a few industry participants that are expected to capitalize on prevalent opportunities.</p><p><b>Industry Description</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Manufacturing-Electronics industry comprises companies that manufacture electronic products like battery chargers, battery accessories, outdoor cabinet enclosures, power transmission products, electrical motion controls and motive power devices. Some industry players also provide water-treatment products, engineered flow components, process equipment and turn-key systems. These companies offer state-of-the-art customer support and after-market services to end users. The firms are increasing investments in developing innovative technologies, boosting customer and employee experience, and supply-chain modernization programs. The manufacturing electronic companies sell products and services in various end markets, including robotics, semiconductor, defense, aerospace, medical equipment and satellite communications.</p><p><b>3 Manufacturing Electronics Industry Trends in Focus</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector</em></strong>: Persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector has been denting the demand in the industry. Per the Institute for Supply Management&rsquo;s (&ldquo;ISM&rdquo;) report, the Manufacturing Purchasing Manager&rsquo;s Index touched 46.8% in July, down from 48.5% in June. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. After breaking a contraction streak of 16 months by growing in March, the manufacturing sector contracted for the fourth consecutive month in July. Also, the New Orders Index remained in the contraction territory for the fourth consecutive month, registering 47.4% in July.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Strength in the Electronics Services Market</strong></em>: Despite a slowdown in manufacturing activities, demand across key end markets has been stable. Electronics manufacturers are steadily benefiting from the higher adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies and processes by original equipment manufacturers. The requirement for integrating advanced electronic components into machinery and electronic devices has been supporting the electronics manufacturing services market. In addition, a few industry players with wide exposure to the booming medical and life science markets are witnessing a positive momentum across their businesses due to sturdy demand for their products and solutions. A surge in the e-commerce business has also been boosting several industry participants&rsquo; prospects.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Technological Advancement Benefits</strong></em>: With the gradual development of business models and cutting-edge technologies, a number of industry players have been banking on digitizing their business operations for a while now. With digitization, businesses are gaining a detailed insight into their operational performances, demand cycles, delivery status and supply-chain issues. This, in turn, is helping them bolster their competitiveness in the market with enhanced operational productivity, product quality and lower costs.</p><p><b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Manufacturing &ndash; Electronics industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #15. This rank places it in the top 6% of more than 250 Zacks industries.<br /><br />The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the strong near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few noteworthy stocks for your consideration. But it is worth looking at the industry&rsquo;s shareholder returns and its current valuation first.</p><p><b>Industry Outperforms Sector & Lags the S&P 500</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Manufacturing &ndash; Electronics industry has outperformed the broader sector but lagged the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index in the year-to-date period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Over this period, the industry has gained 8.2% compared with the sector&rsquo;s and S&amp;P 500 Index&rsquo;s growth of 7.9% and 18.1%, respectively.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/price 1(34).jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 270px;" /></p><p><b>Industry's Current Valuation</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the basis of forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing manufacturing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 22.99X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 21.72X. It is also above the sector&rsquo;s P/E ratio of 19.16X.<br /><br />Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 28.43X, as low as 14.73X and at the median of 22.26X, as the chart below shows.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price-to-Earnings Ratio vs SP500</h2><h2 style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/val 2 sp500.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 241px;" /><br /><br />Price-to-Earnings Ratio vs Sector</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/val 3 sector.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 242px;" /></p><p><b>4 Manufacturing - Electronics Stocks to Buy</b></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Powell Industries</strong>: Headquartered in Houston, TX, the company is engaged in designing, manufacturing and distributing custom-engineered equipment and systems. The company has been witnessing several favorable trends across its oil, gas and petrochemical end markets that include growth in energy transition projects, such as biofuels, carbon capture and hydrogen. Also, significant project awards, supported by high investments in LNG, related gas processing and petrochemical processes, are likely to drive its performance in the quarters ahead. POWL currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). <span style="pd4ml-display: none; pd4ml-visibility: hidden;"> You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>. </span><br /><br />Shares of Powell Industries have soared 118.1% in the year-to-date period. The company reported better-than-expected results in the trailing four quarters, the average being 69.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s fiscal 2024 (ending September 2024) earnings has been revised upward by 32.9% in the past 60 days.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: POWL</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/powl 4(1).jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 292px;" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Eaton</strong>: Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, this is a diversified power management company and a global technology leader in electrical components and systems.

<![CDATA[ Wall Street Analysts Think Intuitive Machines, Inc. (LUNR) Could Surge 75.24%: Read This Before Placing a Bet ]]>

<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:55:04 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <b>Intuitive Machines, Inc.</b> (LUNR) have gained 26.2% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $5.25, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $9.20 indicates a potential upside of 75.2%.</p><p>The mean estimate comprises five short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $1.64. While the lowest estimate of $7 indicates a 33.3% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 109.5% to reach $11. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.</p><p>While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.</p><p>But, for LUNR, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.</p><p><h2>Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets</h2></p><p>According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.</p><p>While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?</p><p>They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.</p><p>However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.</p><p>That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.</p><p><h2>Why LUNR Could Witness a Solid Upside</h2></p><p>Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>For the current year, one estimate has moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 56.7%.</p><p>Moreover, LUNR currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>From a technical perspective, Distribution Solutions Group, Inc. (DSGR) is looking like an interesting pick, as it just reached a key level of support. DSGR's 50-day simple moving average crossed above its 200-day simple moving average, which is known as a "golden cross" in the trading world.</p><p>A golden cross is a technical chart pattern that can signify a potential bullish breakout. It's formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average breaking above a longer-term moving average, with the most common moving averages being the 50-day and the 200-day, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.</p><p>A successful golden cross event has three stages. It first begins when a stock's price on the decline bottoms out. Then, its shorter moving average crosses above its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third and final phase occurs when the stock maintains its upward momentum.</p><p>A golden cross is the opposite of a death cross, another technical event that indicates bearish price movement may be on the horizon.</p><p>Over the past four weeks, DSGR has gained 10.7%. The company currently sits at a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, also indicating that the stock could be poised for a breakout.</p><p>Once investors consider DSGR's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter, the bullish case only solidifies. No earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months compared to 1 revisions higher, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased as well.</p><p><img width='100%' height='auto' src='https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/yseop/549/DSGR_SMA50_200.jpeg' alt='Moving Average Chart for DSGR' title='' class='chart'></p><p>Investors may want to watch DSGR for more gains in the near future given the company's key technical level and positive earnings estimate revisions.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327676/distribution-solutions-group-dsgr-just-flashed-golden-cross-signal-do-you-buy?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|golden_crossover-2327676">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>After reaching an important support level, GeoVax Labs Inc. (GOVX) could be a good stock pick from a technical perspective.

<![CDATA[ Here's Why Aqua Metals (AQMS) Could be Great Choice for a Bottom Fisher ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:55:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <b>Aqua Metals</b> (AQMS) have been struggling lately and have lost 24.1% over the past four weeks. However, a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session, which could mean that the stock found support with bulls being able to counteract the bears. So, it could witness a trend reversal down the road.</p><p>The formation of a hammer pattern is considered a technical indication of nearing a bottom with likely subsiding of selling pressure. But this is not the only factor that makes a bullish case for the stock. On the fundamental side, strong agreement among Wall Street analysts in raising earnings estimates for this lead recycler enhances its prospects of a trend reversal.</p><p><img width='100%' height='auto' src='https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/yseop/550/AQMS_Hammer.jpeg' alt='1-month candlestick chart for AQMS' title='' class='chart'> <h2>What is a Hammer Chart and How to Trade It?</h2></p><p>This is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'</p><p>In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.</p><p>When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.</p><p>Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.</p><p>Like every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.</p><p><h2>Here's What Increases the Odds of a Turnaround for AQMS</h2></p><p>There has been an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions for AQMS lately, which can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.</p><p>The consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 30% over the last 30 days. This means that the Wall Street analysts covering AQMS are majorly in agreement about the company's potential to report better earnings than what they predicted earlier.</p><p>If this is not enough, you should note that AQMS currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>></p><p>Moreover, the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator, helping investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve. So, for the shares of Aqua Metals, a Zacks Rank of 2 is a more conclusive fundamental indication of a potential turnaround.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327677/here-s-why-aqua-metals-aqms-could-be-great-choice-for-a-bottom-fisher?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|hammer_chart_pattern_(ta)-2327677">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Does Backblaze (BLZE) Have the Potential to Rally 70.97% as Wall Street Analysts Expect? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:55:03 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <b>Backblaze, Inc.</b> (BLZE) have gained 2.7% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $6.51, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $11.13 indicates a potential upside of 71%.</p><p>The mean estimate comprises four short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $1.44. While the lowest estimate of $10 indicates a 53.6% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 99.7% to reach $13. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.</p><p>While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.</p><p>However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in BLZE. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.</p><p><h2>Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets</h2></p><p>According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.</p><p>While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?</p><p>They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.</p><p>However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.</p><p>That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.</p><p><h2>Why BLZE Could Witness a Solid Upside</h2></p><p>Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 8% over the past month, as three estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revision.</p><p>Moreover, BLZE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>></p><p>Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much BLZE could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327678/does-backblaze-blze-have-the-potential-to-rally-70-97-as-wall-street-analysts-expect?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|consensus_price_target-2327678">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Reasons to Retain QIAGEN Stock in Your Portfolio Now ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:55:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>QIAGEN N.V.</strong>&rsquo;s&nbsp;QGEN growth is backed by its robust progress in expanding the test menu options. The company&rsquo;s expansive Molecular Diagnostics portfolio continues to be bolstered by several innovations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, QIAGEN&rsquo;s operations are vulnerable to macroeconomic volatilities and currency fluctuations, which can adversely affect its financial results.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Year to date, this Zacks Rank #3 (Buy) stock has risen 0.9% compared with 10.5% growth of the&nbsp;industry. The S&amp;P 500 composite has witnessed an 18.1% rise in the said time frame.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The renowned global provider of sample and assay technologies has a market capitalization of $10.05 billion. QGEN&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 2.64%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let&rsquo;s delve deeper.</p><h2>Key QIAGEN Upsides</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Huge Potential in Molecular Diagnostics:&nbsp;</strong>QIAGEN offers one of the broadest portfolios of molecular technologies for healthcare. In the second quarter of 2024, the 8% CER growth in the Diagnostic Solutions product group underscored the strength and resilience of the company&rsquo;s portfolio mix. The QuantiFERON TB test and the QIAstat syndromic testing system achieved double-digit sales growth amid solid placement.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The QIAstat-Dx testing system&rsquo;s growth was driven by significant gains in consumables and an ongoing good level of instrument placement. The QuantiFERON TB test continued its growth trajectory from the conversion of tuberculin skin testing to modern blood testing and finished another quarter with sales higher than $100 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Progress in Test Menu Expansion:&nbsp;</strong>To support internal growth, QIAGEN heavily invests in research and development for the menu expansion of its key platforms. The second quarter of 2024 marked a series of numerous developments, such as the launch of Investigator Quantiplex Pro FLX kit, which offers forensic laboratories a high level of sensitivity when processing forensics samples.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Within the digital PCR platform QIAcuity, the company launched 35 new wet-lab tested digital PCR Microbial DNA Detection Assays and a new digital PCR (dPCR) Custom Assay Design Tool for copy number variation analysis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/43/75544.jpg?v=849645092" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Key QIAGEN Downsides</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Macro Headwinds Hamper Global Sales:&nbsp;</strong>QIAGEN currently markets products in more than 100 countries. The wide international presence exposes it to diverse risks, including economic volatility, weak legal systems, political instabilities as well as government actions affecting the flow of goods and currency.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the second quarter, the company&rsquo;s sales in the Asia-Pacific Japan region declined at a low-single-digit CER rate. Sales in China declined at a single-digit CER rate, reflecting the macro challenges in this market that are likely to stay for a while.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Foreign Exchange Uncertainties: </strong>Recording more than 50% of its revenues from the international market, QIAGEN is highly exposed to the risk of foreign currency movement. The situation may worsen with the strengthening of the domestic currency against high-focus nations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Any unanticipated currency headwinds in high-focus markets may drag the top and the bottom lines further. Sales in the Asia Pacific, Japan and the Rest of the World region were adversely impacted by 7% points from unfavorable currency movements against the U.S. dollar during the second quarter of 2024.</p><h2>Estimate Trend</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for QIAGEN&rsquo;s 2024 earnings per share has increased 1.4% to $2.15.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company&rsquo;s 2024 revenues is pegged at $1.97 billion, which suggests an increase of 0.2% from the year-ago reported number.</p><h2>Key Picks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are&nbsp;<strong>TransMedix Group</strong>&nbsp;TMDX,&nbsp;<strong>Intuitive Surgical </strong>ISRG and <strong>Boston Scientific</strong>&nbsp;BSX.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TransMedix Group&rsquo;s earnings are expected to surge 255.8% in 2024. The company&rsquo;s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 287.5%. Its shares have risen 178.7% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 10.5% growth in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">TMDX sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see&nbsp;<strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Intuitive Surgical, sporting a Zacks Rank of 1 at present, has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 17.4% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 13.7%. Shares of the company have risen 58.9% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 12.5% growth over the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ISRG&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8.97%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Boston Scientific, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated earnings growth rate of 17.1% for 2024 compared with the industry&rsquo;s 15.7%. Shares of the company have risen 47.8% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 10.4% growth over the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BSX&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.2%.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327738/reasons-to-retain-qiagen-stock-in-your-portfolio-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|rank_focused-2327738">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <h3 style="text-align: justify;">For Immediate Release</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Chicago, IL &ndash;August 27, 2024 &ndash; Zacks Equity Research shares Fabrinet FN as the Bull of the Day and Advance Auto Parts, Inc. AAP, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Coinbase Global, Inc. COIN and Block, Inc. SQ.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bull of the Day:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fabrinet </strong>is a global manufacturing services company that specializes in precision optical, electronic, and electromechanical components. It serves industries such as telecommunications, automotive, and medical devices. Known for its expertise in high-complexity manufacturing, Fabrinet operates facilities primarily in Thailand and the U.S., offering end-to-end manufacturing and supply chain solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At its most recent earnings meeting Fabrinet delivered strong financial results, exceeding market expectations in both revenue and earnings. The company achieved record revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter, totaling $753.3 million, a 15% increase year-over-year, while earnings per share (EPS) also reached a new high, coming in at $2.41. <strong>Fabrinet also announced that its Board of Directors has approved an expansion of its share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $139.5 million of Fabrinet&rsquo;s ordinary shares.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Fabrinet stock has been a powerful performer over the last decade, demonstrating its secure position in the industry and its successful business execution. <strong>Over the last ten years the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 31.7%</strong>, nearly triple that of the broad market.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Analysts Raise Fabrinet Earnings Estimates</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Possibly reflecting such a positive quarterly report, analysts have upgraded earnings estimates for Fabrinet, giving it a <strong>Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) </strong>rating.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Excluding next year&rsquo;s estimates, earnings have been revised higher unanimously and across timeframes. Current quarter earnings estimates have been boosted by 7.2% and are expected to grow 19.5% year-over-year (YoY), while FY25 earnings estimates have climbed by 5.7% and are forecast to grow 11.6% YoY.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Revenue is expected to grow 11.3% this year to $3.2 billion, while next year is expected to increase 9.6% to $3.5 billion.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Fabrinet Shares Trade at a Historical Premium</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">As the quality of Fabrinet&rsquo;s business has become more recognized by market participants its valuation has steadily climbed over the last 10 years. Today<strong>, FN is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 29.3x</strong>, which is well above its 10-year median of 16.6x and above the broad market average.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is worth noting that as a company grows larger and demonstrates consistent profit growth such as Fabrinet has done it brings in a new class of investors who seek such a well-guarded business model. Because of this the appropriate earnings multiple can creep up as seen in FN. Nonetheless, its strong position was only further confirmed by the recent quarterly report. FN&rsquo;s five-year median valuation was 20.1x, more closely reflecting this position of quality.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Should Investors Buy Fabrinet Stock?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Fabrinet&#39;s strong performance, both in terms of financial results and stock appreciation, reflects the company&rsquo;s solid execution and leadership in the high-tech manufacturing sector. With record revenue growth, consistent earnings beats, and an expanding share repurchase program, Fabrinet is well-positioned for continued success.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, investors should be aware of the stock&#39;s elevated valuation. Trading at a forward earnings multiple is above its historical median&mdash;Fabrinet is priced at a premium. This premium may be justified by its consistent performance and strong industry positioning, but it also suggests that future returns may be more dependent on continued execution and growth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For long-term investors looking for exposure to a high-quality company with a proven track record in precision manufacturing and growth potential in key sectors like telecommunications, automotive, and medical devices, Fabrinet could still be a strong buy. However, new investors should consider the current valuation and potentially look for pullbacks to optimize entry points.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, Fabrinet represents a compelling investment opportunity, particularly for those focused on long-term growth in the technology and manufacturing sectors.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Bear of the Day:</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advance Auto Parts, Inc.</strong> is struggling in a challenging retail environment. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) recently missed on earnings for the 6<sup>th</sup> quarter in a row.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Advance Auto Parks is an automotive aftermarket parts providers that serves both professional installers and do-it-yourself (DIY) customers.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As of July 13, 2024, Advance Auto Parks operated 4,776 stores and 321 Worldpac branches mostly in the United States but with additional locations in Canada, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. It also sells online at its website of AdvanceAutoParts.com.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Another Miss in the Second Quarter of 2024</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">On Aug 22, 2024, Advance Auto Parts reported its second quarter 2024 results and missed again on earnings. It reported $0.75 versus the Zacks Consensus of $0.97, or a miss of $0.22.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sales were flat compared to the year ago quarter, at $2.7 billion.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Comparable store sales, a key metric for retailers, was up, but just 0.4%. But the company saw this as a win due to the &ldquo;challenging demand environment&rdquo; during the quarter.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Selling Worldpac for $1.5 Billion</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">On Aug 22, 2024, Advance Auto Parts also announced it was selling its wholesale distribution business, Worldpac, to Carlyle for $1.5 billion in cash.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">This will allow Advance Auto Parts to focus on the big box retail component of the business and will free up some ready cash.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Analysts are Bearish as They Cut Earnings Estimates</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Analysts are bearish on Advance Auto Parts. 3 estimates have been cut for both 2024 and 2025 over the last month.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The 2024 Zacks Consensus has fallen to $3.61 from $3.94 over the last 90 days. But that is still earnings growth of 622% as the company only made $0.50 last year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">3 estimates have also been cut for 2025 over the last month as well. That has pushed the Zacks Consensus down to $4.25 from $4.46 over the last 90 days. That&rsquo;s further earnings growth of 17.9%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, for 2024, the company&rsquo;s comparable store sales guidance remained weak at a range of a decline of 1.0% on the low end and flat, or 0.0%, on the high end.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Shares of Advance Auto Parts Near New 5-Year Lows</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Once a pandemic winner, shares of Advance Auto Parts have now sunk to new 5-year lows. It is going the opposite direction from the S&amp;P 500 over that period.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Is it cheap?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Advance Auto Parts trades with a forward P/E of 13.6.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is also paying a dividend, currently yielding 2%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But with the analysts so pessimistic, investors may want to wait on the sidelines for a turnaround in comp sales. That&#39;s when you&#39;ll know the business is turning ti around.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Additional content:</h3><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><em>BTC Rallies as Fed Signals Rate Cuts: NVDA, COIN, SQ to Gain </em></h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The price of Bitcoin (BTC) scaled upward recently after the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s Chair Jerome Powell said at the Jackson Hole Symposium that &ldquo;time has come&rdquo; to trim interest rates soon.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Rate cuts, by the way, are bullish for cryptocurrencies like BTC, and stocks such as <strong>NVIDIA Corp.</strong>, <strong>Coinbase Global, Inc. </strong>and <strong>Block, Inc</strong>. are well-poised to gain from the digital coins&rsquo; present upsurge.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">BTC Bull Run Is Here</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Despite a rollercoaster ride, BTC has been able to lure investors repeatedly since its inception in 2009. It witnessed modest gains in 2012 but surged substantially in 2017, and the momentum carried into 2021.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BTC&rsquo;s meteoric rise, however, was disrupted in 2022, yet the flagship cryptocurrency bounced back in 2023 to end at $42,258. In 2024, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs fueled another rally, with BTC&rsquo;s price climbing above $70,000 by March.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">BTC&rsquo;s price, nevertheless, has been struggling to hold above its key support level of $58,000 in recent times as investors remained cautious ahead of the Fed&rsquo;s monetary policy decision.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Things improved as BTC&rsquo;s price scaled upward in the last couple of trading sessions to trade around $64,000 following the Fed&rsquo;s assurance that the time has come for an interest rate cut soon. BTC&rsquo;s price has jumped 9.2% in the last seven trading days raising speculation of a forthcoming upswing.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">What&rsquo;s Propelling BTC Price Higher?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Powell recently said that time has arrived to cut interest rates as inflationary pressures have begun to subside. The minutes from the Fed&rsquo;s latest policy meeting also indicated that an interest rate cut in September is highly likely.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per the CME FedWatch Tool, 61.5% of market participants expect the Fed to trim interest rates by a quarter-point in the September meeting, with many estimating at least two rate cuts this year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Liquidity increases amid a lower interest rate scenario. Thus, spending on riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies and stocks typically rises. At the same time, a significant downward selling pressure on BTC has waned. After all, the German government has concluded BTC liquidations and Bitcoin whales have started to acquire additional BTC.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">3 Stocks to Make the Most of BTC&rsquo;s Upward Trajectory</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">With the price of BTC set to scale northward, things are hunky dory for NVIDIA, Coinbase Global and Block, which can take advantage of the world&rsquo;s numero uno cryptocurrency&rsquo;s bullish momentum. These stocks currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see&nbsp;the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">NVIDIA has entered the cryptocurrency space by developing graphic processing units for mining cryptos like BTC.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Nvidia&rsquo;s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 106.9% and 26.1%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 93.9% and 30.9%, respectively (read more:&nbsp;The Better AI Stock to Buy Now: NVDA or SMCI)</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Coinbase Global</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Coinbase Global is one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States. BTC is traded in its crypto-trading platform.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Coinbase Global&rsquo;s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter and year is 6,000% and 1,435.1%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current quarter and year is 93.1% and 84.8%, respectively.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Block</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Digital payment company Block generates revenues from products such as Cash App, where BTC is traded.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Block&rsquo;s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 98.9% and 27%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 11.9% and 9.6%, respectively.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of NVIDIA, Coinbase Global and Block have gained 176.2%, 186.8% and 17%, respectively, over the past year.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why Haven&#39;t You Looked at Zacks&#39; Top Stocks?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P&#39;s +7.0 average gain per year.

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Autodesk</strong> ADSK, a leader in 3D design software, is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug. 29.<br /><br />The company anticipates revenues between $1.475 billion and $1.49 billion for the fiscal second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.48 billion, suggesting growth of 10.2% from the year-ago quarter.<br /><br />Autodesk projects non-GAAP earnings in the band of $1.98-$2.04 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 4.71% year-over-year rise.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/31/75522.jpg?v=1050256255" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the last reported quarter, Autodesk delivered an earnings surprise of 5.06%. Markedly, the company&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 6.83%.</p><div class="chart_embed"><h2 style="text-align: center;">Autodesk, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise</h2><p style="text-align: center;"> <img alt="Autodesk, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/68/1724761791.png" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" title="" /> </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Autodesk, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Autodesk, Inc. Quote</p></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Earnings Whispers</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Autodesk this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.<br /><br />Autodesk has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Factors Likely to Shape Autodesk&rsquo;s Upcoming Results</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&#39;s fiscal second-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from strong growth in subscription revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for subscription revenues is pegged at $1.4 billion, indicating growth of 10.6% year over year.<br /><br />This growth is attributed to the increasing trend of cloud migration, which is being accelerated by the ongoing digital transformation across various industries. The demand for Autodesk&#39;s cloud solutions is being propelled by this broader trend.<br /><br />A solid uptick in the maintenance-to-subscription program, continued momentum in new customer billings and steady renewals are expected to have acted as tailwinds.&nbsp;<br /><br />The robust adoption of the AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT product family is anticipated to have favored ADSK&#39;s top line. AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT are flagship products within Autodesk&#39;s portfolio, which is widely used in various industries for computer-aided design purposes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT product family&rsquo;s fiscal second-quarter revenues is pegged at $391 million.<br /><br />The company is likely to have gained from the robust performance of the Enterprise Business Agreements program. This is anticipated to have boosted Autodesk&rsquo;s remaining performance obligation growth rates in the quarter to be reported.<br /><br />Gains from Autodesk Build, a field management solution and part of the Autodesk Construction Cloud, are expected to have contributed to the to-be-reported quarter&#39;s top line as the company has been witnessing steady traction with owners, general contractors and subcontractors across the construction industry.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Media &amp; Entertainment, Manufacturing and Other product family&rsquo;s fiscal second-quarter revenues is pegged at $74 million, $271 million and $21.79 million, respectively.<br /><br />However, inflationary pressure, foreign exchange movements and macroeconomic headwinds might have negatively impacted ADSK&rsquo;s fiscal second-quarter performance.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Price Performance &amp; Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Autodesk has seen its stock price climb 5.2% year to date, underperforming the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector&rsquo;s rise of 22.2%. This modest gain came amid a challenging macroeconomic environment, raising questions about the company&#39;s future trajectory and what investors can expect moving forward.<br /><br />The company&#39;s resilience can be attributed to its strong market position and successful transition to a subscription-based model. This shift has resulted in more predictable cash flows and potentially higher lifetime customer value. The subscription model has helped Autodesk weather economic fluctuations more effectively, as recurring revenues provide a buffer against short-term market volatility.<br /><br />Autodesk aims to capitalize on its position as a market leader in the CAD market by investing in generative AI to enhance its customer base. Autodesk AutoCAD has the highest market share of 31%, followed by Dassault SolidWorks with 12%, <strong>Dassault Systemes </strong>DASTY with 10%, and <strong>ANSYS </strong>ANSS and <strong>PTC </strong>PTC with less than 5%, according to a report by PSH.<br /><br />As the company continues to execute its long-term strategy and adapt to changing market conditions, investors will be weighing the potential for future growth against the current valuation.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Autodesk is trading at a premium with a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 37.08X compared with the Zacks Computer - Software industry&rsquo;s 18.41X, reflecting a stretched valuation.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">ADSK&rsquo;s EV/EBITDA TTM Ratio Depicts Stretched Valuation</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/55/75523.jpg?v=540114585" style="width: 620px; height: 310px;" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Investment Considerations: Balancing Risk and Reward</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Autodesk presents a compelling investment opportunity. The company&#39;s dominant position in computer-aided design (CAD) software for architecture, engineering and manufacturing industries provides a strong competitive moat. Autodesk&#39;s transition to a subscription-based model has improved revenue predictability and customer retention. The increasing adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and digital transformation across industries drives demand for Autodesk&#39;s solutions. With emerging technologies like generative design and cloud-based collaboration tools, Autodesk is well-positioned for long-term growth. However, economic cycles affecting the construction and manufacturing sectors pose potential risks to the company&#39;s performance.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&#39;s strong market position, successful transition to cloud-based solutions, and strategic focus on sustainability and emerging technologies like generative design, digital twins, and BIM position it well for future success. Risk-averse investors or those with a shorter investment horizon may want to exercise caution and wait for a better entry point, given the uncertainties surrounding the company&#39;s ability to maintain high growth rates in a maturing market. Autodesk currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

<![CDATA[ Amplify Energy Falls 5.4% in August: Here's How to Play the Stock ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:52:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Amplify Energy</strong>&#39;s AMPY stock price has been under pressure since the beginning of August. Shares have dropped 5.4% this month, underperforming the sector and the S&amp;P 500. Some of the energy explorer&rsquo;s losses can be tied to declining oil prices on the back of slower economic growth in China. But with the company also faring worse than its peers like <strong>W&amp;T Offshore</strong> WTI and <strong>Ring Energy</strong> REI, there could be more than meets the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">August Price Performance</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/fe/75557.jpg?v=329023575" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Is the selling off of this stock now over, or do need to wait and allow the dust to settle in order to get a clearer picture of just what the future might hold?&nbsp;<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the company and try to find an answer.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">About Amplify Energy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Founded in 2011, the Houston, TX-based operator has a strong presence in Oklahoma, Southern California and Texas, and has stakes such as Bairoil in the Rocky Mountains. Amplify Energy&rsquo;s diversified operations &mdash; spread over five U.S. basins &mdash; mitigate pricing and operational disruptions, while its long-life, long-production assets generate sustainable cash flows.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">An Earnings Miss for AMPY in 2Q</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">On Aug 7, 2024, Amplify Energy announced its second-quarter 2024 results and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 45%. Earnings were just 17 cents per share compared to expectations of 31 cents. The latest disappointment adds to the company&rsquo;s already troubling earnings surprise trend. AMPY missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/47/75560.jpg?v=847934035" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>The soft headline numbers compelled analysts to lower this year&#39;s EPS consensus by 19% from $1.28 to $1.16, representing a 9.4% drop in annual profits.<br /><br />In the second quarter, Amplify Energy&#39;s production was significantly impacted by unforeseen flooding in East Texas, which curtailed operations for over 100 days. This disruption, which hampered access to a large number of wells, underscores the vulnerability of the company&rsquo;s operations to natural events. Such production interruptions not only reduce output but also expose Amplify to risks of missed revenue and earnings targets, particularly if similar events recur, potentially leading to downward pressure on the stock.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Issues Plaguing Amplify Energy</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The company&rsquo;s decision to allocate $60 million to $65 million in capital expenditures for 2024, with a heavy focus on the Beta project and non-operated drilling, raises concerns. This elevated spending, particularly with the majority concentrated in the first three quarters, could strain free cash flow.<br /><br />Amplify Energy&#39;s net debt of approximately $117.5 million, with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.2X, suggests limited financial flexibility. The slight increase in net debt, driven by changes in working capital and increased investment, indicates that the company may struggle to manage its debt efficiently if cash flow generation does not meet expectations.<br /><br />Amplify Energy&rsquo;s history of environmental incidents, particularly the 2021 oil spill off the California coast, also continues to cast a pall over its operations. The $96.5 million settlement from the shipping companies highlights the financial burden of such incidents. Additionally, the ongoing regulatory scrutiny and potential future environmental risks could lead to further liabilities or operational restrictions.<br /><br />Amplify Energy is a component of the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which currently ranks in the bottom 17% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next few months.<br /><br />The gloomy outlook for the short term has pushed the AMPY stock lower.</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s Not All Gloom and Doom for AMPY</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Even though the weak quarterly results caused a post-earnings share plunge, there are, however, positives.<br /><br />Amplify Energy&rsquo;s successful development of the A50 well in the Beta field, which exceeded production expectations, highlights the untapped potential of this asset. Then, the company&rsquo;s strategic decision to participate in high-return non-operated wells in East Texas and the Eagle Ford is poised to enhance cash flow in early 2025. Finally, Amplify Energy&rsquo;s continued focus on reducing lease operating expenses should improve profitability.&nbsp;</p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Is Amplify Energy Cheap?</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">From a valuation perspective, while Amplify Energy might appear attractive relative to the industry, it is still trading above its 5-year median. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company is trading at forward earnings multiple of 4.93, higher than its 5-year median of 4.65. We don&rsquo;t think that this premium is justified given the company&rsquo;s unexpected production disruptions and elevated capital allocation.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/4d/75563.jpg?v=1767007873" /> <span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Takeaway</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">On the horizon, Amplify Energy looks cheap but the company could end up being a value trap as its EPS outlook continues to weaken. The fact that AMPY is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns.<br /><br />Therefore, based on the current setup, Amplify Energy&rsquo;s stock is one to avoid.<br /><br />AMPY currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).<br /><br />You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327735/amplify-energy-falls-5-4-in-august-here-s-how-to-play-the-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|most_popular_stocks-2327735">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.</p><p>The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.</p><p>Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>Finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value, are what value investors like to focus on. So, the Value Style Score takes into account ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to highlight the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum investors, who live by the saying "the trend is your friend," are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.</p><p>It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.</p><p>Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: TransUnion (TRU)</h2></p><p>Headquartered in Chicago, IL, TransUnion is one of the leading global providers of risk and information solutions to businesses and consumers. The company provides consumer reports, risk scores, analytical services and decisioning capabilities to businesses. What sets TransUnion apart are its distinctive and comprehensive datasets, next-generation technology and its analytics and decision-making capabilities &mdash; which enable it to deliver insights across the complete consumer lifecycle. TransUnion boasts rich domain proficiency across a wide range of industry verticals, including insurance, healthcare and financial services. It also caters to verticals like wireless, real estate and general commercial/business information. Possession of both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data, enables the company better predict behaviors, assess risk and address a broader set of business issues for its customers.</p><p>TRU is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>Momentum investors should take note of this Business Services stock. TRU has a Momentum Style Score of A, and shares are up 11.3% over the past four weeks.</p><p>Two analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $3.87 per share. TRU also boasts an average earnings surprise of 5.8%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, TRU should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327643/why-transunion-tru-is-a-top-momentum-stock-for-the-long-term?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_momentum_score-2327643">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.</p><p>The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.</p><p>It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>Developed alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>Growth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.

The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend."

<![CDATA[ <p>For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.</p><p>The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.</p><p>It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.</p><p>#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.</p><p>For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: EOG Resources (EOG)</h2></p><p>Headquartered in Houston, TX, EOG Resources Inc. primarily focuses on the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. While the company&#39;s operations extend to the United States and Trinidad, the majority of its activities are concentrated across the oil-rich resources within the United States.</p><p>EOG is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>Momentum investors should take note of this Oils-Energy stock. EOG has a Momentum Style Score of B, and shares are up 3.9% over the past four weeks.</p><p>Six analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.12 to $12.20 per share. EOG boasts an average earnings surprise of 6.2%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, EOG should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327654/here-s-why-eog-resources-eog-is-a-strong-momentum-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_momentum_score-2327654">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.</p><p>The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.</p><p>It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>Developed alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics.

The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.</p><p>#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame.

If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.</p><p>A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Caterpillar (CAT)</h2></p><p>Caterpillar, known for its iconic yellow machines, is the largest global construction and mining equipment manufacturer. Given that it serves a gamut of sectors - infrastructure, construction, mining, oil &amp; gas and transportation, the company is considered a bellwether of the global economy.</p><p>CAT is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>Momentum investors should take note of this Industrial Products stock. CAT has a Momentum Style Score of A, and shares are up 1.9% over the past four weeks.</p><p>Seven analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.08 to $21.87 per share. CAT boasts an average earnings surprise of 11%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, CAT should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327650/here-s-why-caterpillar-cat-is-a-strong-momentum-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_momentum_score-2327650">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.</p><p>The research service features daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, all of which will help you become a smarter, more confident investor.</p><p>It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>Growth investors are more concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, the Growth Style Score analyzes characteristics like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum investors, who live by the saying "the trend is your friend," are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.</p><p>It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.</p><p>For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Arch Capital Group (ACGL)</h2></p><p>Established in 1995 and headquartered in Pembroke, Bermuda, Arch Capital Group Ltd. offers insurance, reinsurance and mortgage insurance across the world. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurer provides a wide range of products and services, which include primary and excess casualty coverages, professional indemnity, workers compensation and umbrella liability and employers liability insurance coverages. The company offers a full range of property, casualty and mortgage insurance and reinsurance lines while maintaining a focus on writing specialty lines of insurance and reinsurance.</p><p>ACGL is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>Momentum investors should take note of this Finance stock. ACGL has a Momentum Style Score of B, and shares are up 12.9% over the past four weeks.</p><p>Six analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.46 to $9.01 per share. ACGL also boasts an average earnings surprise of 28.9%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, ACGL should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327649/are-you-a-momentum-investor-this-1-stock-could-be-the-perfect-pick?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_momentum_score-2327649">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ ScanSource (SCSC) Misses Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:50:02 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>ScanSource (SCSC) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.95 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.76 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.</p><p>This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -15.79%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this technology products distributor would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering a surprise of -17.86%.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.</p><p>ScanSource<yt:no-break-space/>, which belongs to the Zacks Industrial Services industry, posted revenues of $746.11 million for the quarter ended June 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.25%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $947.36 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.</p><p>The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.</p><p>ScanSource shares have added about 23.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.8%.</p><p><h2>What's Next for ScanSource?</h2></p><p>While ScanSource has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?</p><p>There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.</p><p>Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.</p><p>Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for ScanSource: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.79 on $828.95 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.39 on $3.43 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.</p><p>Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Industrial Services is currently in the bottom 11% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.</p><p>One other stock from the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, Donaldson (DCI), is yet to report results for the quarter ended July 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 28.</p><p>This maker of filtration systems is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.88 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +12.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.</p><p>Donaldson's revenues are expected to be $941.12 million, up 7% from the year-ago quarter.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327661/scansource-scsc-misses-q4-earnings-and-revenue-estimates?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_4-2327661">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>A proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.</p><p>It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.</p><p>A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: USA Compression Partners (USAC)</h2></p><p>Founded in 1998, USA Compression Partners, LP is one of the largest independent natural gas compression services providers across the United States in terms of fleet horsepower. Structured as a master limited partnership (&quot;MLP&quot;) with the Energy Transfer family owning approximately 48%, it primarily focuses on large-horsepower applications (greater than 1,000 horsepower) in a number of areas including the Permian/Delaware, Marcellus/Utica, Mid-Continent/SCOOP/STACK, South Texas, East Texas, Louisiana, Rockies. The firm is also involved in engineering, design, operation, service, and repair of compressor units.</p><p>USAC is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.</p><p>Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. USAC has a Growth Style Score of A, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 233.3% for the current fiscal year.</p><p>One analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.03 to $0.80 per share. USAC also boasts an average earnings surprise of 5.5%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, USAC should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327622/are-you-a-growth-investor-this-1-stock-could-be-the-perfect-pick?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_growth_score-2327622">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.</p><p>Featuring daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.</p><p>Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook.

Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.</p><p>#1 (Strong Buy) stocks have produced an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, which is more than double the S&P 500's performance over the same time frame. However, the Zacks Rank examines a ton of stocks, and there can be more than 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, and another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>To have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.</p><p>Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Terex (TEX)</h2></p><p>Incorporated in 1986, Terex Corporation is a global manufacturer of aerial work platforms, materials processing machinery and cranes. It designs, build and support products used in construction, maintenance, manufacturing, energy, minerals and materials management applications.</p><p>TEX is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.</p><p>Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. TEX has a Growth Style Score of B, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 2.3% for the current fiscal year.</p><p>For fiscal 2024, six analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.16 to $7.22 per share. TEX boasts an average earnings surprise of 7%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, TEX should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327621/why-terex-tex-is-a-top-growth-stock-for-the-long-term?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_growth_score-2327621">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

IDACORP served 633,000 retail customers as of Dec 31, 2023.</p><p>IDA is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>Additionally, the company could be a top pick for growth investors. IDA has a Growth Style Score of B, forecasting year-over-year earnings growth of 5.3% for the current fiscal year.</p><p>One analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.05 to $5.41 per share. IDA also boasts an average earnings surprise of 10.4%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, IDA should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327630/why-idacorp-ida-is-a-top-growth-stock-for-the-long-term?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_growth_score-2327630">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ The Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry faces challenges due to high inflation and elevated interest rates. The industry is benefiting from the optimization of business processes, consistent strategic partnerships and digital initiatives. Moreover, robust demand for concerts, strong bookings for cruise operators and higher per capita spending at theme parks are supporting the industry. Firms like <strong>Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.</strong> RCL, <strong>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.</strong> NCLH and <strong>Cinemark Holdings, Inc.</strong> CNK.<p><b>Industry Description</b></p><p>The Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry comprises various recreation providers, such as cruise, entertainment and media owners, golf-related leisure and entertainment venue businesses, theme park makers, resort operators and event organizers. Some industry players have ski and sports businesses, while some operate health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and at destination resorts. Many companies are engaged in hospitality and related businesses. A few industry participants also provide weight management products and services. These companies primarily thrive on overall economic growth, which fuels consumer demand for products. Demand, which is highly dependent on business cycles, is driven by a healthy labor market, rising wages and a growing disposable income.</p><p><b>3 Trends Shaping the Leisure & Recreation Services Industry's Future</b></p><p><em><strong>High Interest Rates: </strong></em>The prolonged inflation, culminating in the highest U.S. interest rates, hurt the industry. Interest rates are at record-high levels. The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 in its fight to bring down 40-year high inflation. The annual inflation rate in the United States slowed for a fourth successive month to 2.9% in July 2024, the lowest since March 2021, compared with 3% in June and below forecasts of 3%. However, the figure is still above the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s target of 2%.<br /><br /><em><strong>Robust Demand Aids Cruise Operators:</strong></em> The cruise industry is benefiting from strong demand for cruising and accelerating booking volumes. The industry is benefiting from solid bookings concerning North American and European sailings. Also, strong pricing (on closer-in-demand) and solid onboard spending bode well for the industry. According to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the number of passengers embarking on cruises is projected to reach 35.7 million in 2024, suggesting an increase from 31.7 million in 2023.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em><strong>Theme Park Operators &amp; Live Entertainment Companies Bouncing Back:</strong></em> The theme park industry is benefiting from robust demand. Theme park operators have been gaining from improving visitation. Consumer spending at theme parks continues to rise. The theme park sector is experiencing a boost from integrating technology, particularly through augmented and virtual reality. By incorporating innovative motion simulators, hydraulics and pneumatics and centering on enhancing customer experiences, there&#39;s anticipation of a surge in market demand in the coming years. Live entertainment firms have benefited from pent-up live event demand and robust ticket sales.</p><p><b>Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dismal Prospects</b></p><p>The Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry is grouped within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #164, which places it in the bottom 35% of 251 Zacks industries.<br /><br />The group&rsquo;s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.<br /><br />The industry&rsquo;s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries results from a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in the group&rsquo;s earnings growth potential. Since Apr. 30, 2024, the industry&#39;s earnings estimates for 2024 have declined 4.3%.<br /><br />Before we present a few stocks that investors can consider, let&rsquo;s analyze the industry&rsquo;s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.</p><p><b>Industry Underperforms the S&P 500</b></p><p>The Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector in the past year. Stocks in the industry have gained 4.4% in the past year compared with the broader sector&rsquo;s increase of 7.6%. The S&amp;P 500 has risen 27% in the said time frame.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">One-Year Price Performance<br /><br /><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/lesisure services_price.jpg" /></h2><p><b>Valuation</b></p><p>On the basis of the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing debt-laden leisure service stocks, the industry trades at 56.41X compared with the S&amp;P 500&rsquo;s 25.11X and the sector&rsquo;s 13.76X. In the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 61.59X and as low as 6.47X, with the median being 9.49X, as the charts show.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">EV/EBITDA Ratio (F12M) Compared With S&amp;P<br /><br /><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/leisure services _val.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 387px;" /></h2><p><b>3 Leisure and Recreation Services Stocks to Keep an Eye On</b></p><p><strong>Royal Caribbean Cruises:</strong> Based in Miami and incorporated in 1985, Royal Caribbean Cruises is a cruise company. It has been benefiting from strong cruising demand from new and loyal guests and robust booking trends. Also, strength in consumer spending onboard and pre-cruise purchases bodes well. The company emphasized investing in a modern digital travel platform to streamline the vacation booking process for customers and expand wallet share.<br /><br />Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have surged 64.8% in the past year. In 2024, the company&rsquo;s sales and earnings are expected to witness growth of 18.1% and 69.9%, respectively, from the prior year&rsquo;s reported levels. <span style="pd4ml-display: none; pd4ml-visibility: hidden;"> You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>. </span></p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: RCL</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/rcl_price(3).jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 413px;" /></p><p><strong>Norwegian Cruise: </strong>The company is benefiting from strong demand, high pricing and increased booking volumes, leading to record advance ticket sales. Its focus on fleet expansion efforts and digital initiatives bodes well. These factors showcase that NCLH&rsquo;s strategy is well-aligned with its growth goals and 2026 financial and sustainability targets. Given the substantial progress made so far and current demand expectations, the company raised its 2024 full-year guidance.<br /><br />Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 company have moved up 5.4% in the past three months. In the fiscal 2024, the company&rsquo;s earnings and sales are expected to witness growth of 122.9% and 9.8% year over year, respectively.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Price and Consensus: NCLH</h2><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/zadmin_tuner_image/nclh_price.jpg" style="width: 620px; height: 417px;" /></p><p><strong>Cinemark Holdings:</strong> The company, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the motion picture exhibition business. Cinemark&#39;s growth prospects are optimistic, driven by encouraging trends in consumer moviegoing, film volume recovery and strong content appeal. The company believes it is uniquely positioned to succeed due to its competitive strengths and various strategies for value creation.<br /><br />Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 company have surged 64.8% in the past three months.

<![CDATA[ <p>Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both.</p><p>The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.</p><p>Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores, developed alongside the Zacks Rank, are complementary indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing methodologies; they also help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics. Just like in school, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on -- that means the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum investors, who live by the saying "the trend is your friend," are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum. It's also one of the best indicators to use with the Zacks Rank.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>A proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.</p><p>It's highly successful, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988. That's more than double the S&P 500. But because of the large number of stocks we rate, there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.</p><p>Here's an example: a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one with Style Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings outlook, and a bigger chance its share price will decrease too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Molson Coors Brewing (TAP)</h2></p><p>Molson Coors Beverage Company, previously known as Molson Coors Brewing Company, was formed by the merger of Molson Inc. and Adolph Coors Co. in February 2005. The global manufacturer and seller of beer and other beverage products has an impressive diverse portfolio of owned and partner brands. These brands include global priority brands such as Blue Moon, Miller Lite, CoorsBanquet, Coors Light, Miller Genuine Draft and Staropramen; as well as regional champion brands like Carling, Molson Canadian. The company also boasts some other major country-specific brands, along with craft and specialty beers, namely, Creemore Springs, Henry&#39;s Hard, Cobra, Doom Bar and Leinenkugel&#39;s.</p><p>TAP is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.</p><p>It also boasts a Value Style Score of A thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 9.38; value investors should take notice.</p><p>Eight analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.06 to $5.75 per share. TAP also boasts an average earnings surprise of 20%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, TAP should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327586/here-s-why-molson-coors-brewing-tap-is-a-strong-value-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_value_score-2327586">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors, and Zacks Premium offers many different ways to do both.</p><p>Featuring daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.</p><p>It also includes access to the Zacks Style Scores.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Based on their value, growth, and momentum characteristics, each stock is assigned a rating of A, B, C, D, or F. The better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform; an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value. Utilizing ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and many other multiples, the Value Style Score identifies the most attractive and most discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>While good value is important, growth investors are more focused on a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score takes projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow into account to uncover stocks that will see long-term, sustainable growth.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum investors, who live by the saying "the trend is your friend," are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>What if you like to use all three types of investing? The VGM Score is a combination of all Style Scores, making it one of the most comprehensive indicators to use with the Zacks Rank. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, which helps narrow down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank, which is a proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to make building a winning portfolio easier.</p><p>Investors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>But it can feel overwhelming to pick the right stocks for you and your investing goals with over 800 top-rated stocks to choose from.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>To maximize your returns, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. This means picking stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you find yourself looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, make sure they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>As mentioned above, the Scores are designed to work with the Zacks Rank, so any change to a company's earnings outlook should be a deciding factor when picking which stocks to buy.</p><p>For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO)</h2></p><p>San Diego, CA-based Halozyme Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company, focused on the development and commercialization of novel treatments for oncology indications by targeting tumor microenvironment. The company also licenses its novel drug delivery technology, ENHANZE, for subcutaneous (SC) administration of drugs.</p><p>HALO is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>It also boasts a Value Style Score of B thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 15.93; value investors should take notice.</p><p>For fiscal 2024, three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0 to $3.90 per share. HALO boasts an average earnings surprise of 9.2%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, HALO should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327590/here-s-why-halozyme-therapeutics-halo-is-a-strong-value-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_value_score-2327590">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>Value investors love finding good stocks at good prices, especially before the broader market catches on to a stock's true value.

The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you want a combination of all three Style Scores, then the VGM Score will be your friend. It rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping you find the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.

If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.</p><p>A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: Encompass Health (EHC)</h2></p><p>Encompass Health Corporation is a provider of integrated healthcare services. It offers facility-based patient care through its network of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. With a national footprint that includes 162 hospitals across 37 states and Puerto Rico, the company delivers high-quality, cost-effective, integrated care in the healthcare space.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.07 to $4.17 per share.

But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B. If you like a stock that only as a #3 (Hold) rank, it should also have Scores of A or B to guarantee as much upside potential as possible.</p><p>The direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should always be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy, since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank.</p><p>For instance, a stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, even one that boasts Scores of A and B, still has a downward-trending earnings forecast, and a much greater likelihood its share price will decline as well.</p><p>Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.</p><p><h2>Stock to Watch: DaVita HealthCare (DVA)</h2></p><p>Denver, CO-headquartered DaVita Inc. is a leading provider of dialysis services in the U.S. to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The company operates kidney dialysis centers and provides related medical services primarily in dialysis centers and in contracted hospitals across the U.S. Its services include outpatient dialysis services, hospital inpatient dialysis services and ancillary services such as ESRD laboratory services and disease management services.</p><p>DVA is a #1 (Strong Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.</p><p>It also boasts a Value Style Score of A thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 15.49; value investors should take notice.</p><p>Three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.37 to $9.99 per share. DVA boasts an average earnings surprise of 24.2%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, DVA should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327600/why-davita-healthcare-dva-is-a-top-value-stock-for-the-long-term?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_value_score-2327600">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>For new and old investors, taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals. Zacks Premium provides lots of different ways to do both.</p><p>Featuring daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, full access to the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens, the research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor.</p><p>Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.</p><p><h2>What are the Zacks Style Scores?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Style Scores is a unique set of guidelines that rates stocks based on three popular investing types, and were developed as complementary indicators for the Zacks Rank. This combination helps investors choose securities with the highest chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.</p><p>Each stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:</p><p><i>Value Score</i></p><p>For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.</p><p><i>Growth Score</i></p><p>Growth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.</p><p><i>Momentum Score</i></p><p>Momentum traders and investors live by the saying "the trend is your friend." This investing style is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Employing factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, the Momentum Style Score can indicate favorable times to build a position in high-momentum stocks.</p><p><i>VGM Score</i></p><p>If you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.</p><p><h2>How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>A proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank utilizes the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings outlook, to help investors create a successful portfolio.</p><p>Investors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.</p><p>With more than 800 top-rated stocks to choose from, it can certainly feel overwhelming to pick the ones that are right for you and your investing journey.</p><p>That's where the Style Scores come in.</p><p>You want to make sure you're buying stocks with the highest likelihood of success, and to do that, you'll need to pick stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B.

The company services personal care, healthcare, beverage and food markets in South America, North America, Asia and Europe. On a geographical basis, Berry Global has operations in the United States and Canada (54.4% of fiscal 2023 net revenues), Europe (36%) and the rest of the world (9.6%). The company employs approximately 44,000 people globally (as of the end of fiscal 2023).</p><p>BERY is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of B.</p><p>It also boasts a Value Style Score of A thanks to attractive valuation metrics like a forward P/E ratio of 8.79; value investors should take notice.</p><p>Six analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.17 to $7.60 per share. BERY boasts an average earnings surprise of 2.9%.</p><p>With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, BERY should be on investors' short list.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327599/why-this-1-value-stock-could-be-a-great-addition-to-your-portfolio?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|zacks_education_value_score-2327599">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>While the proven Zacks Rank places an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find strong stocks, we also know that investors tend to develop their own individual strategies. With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.</p><p>Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.</p><p>In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's "Value" category. Stocks with "A" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.</p><p><b>Edgewell Personal Care (EPC)</b> is a stock many investors are watching right now. EPC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 12.64 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 18.05. Over the past year, EPC's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.66 and as low as 11.51, with a median of 12.85.</p><p>Finally, investors will want to recognize that EPC has a P/CF ratio of 9.59. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 21.34. Over the past 52 weeks, EPC's P/CF has been as high as 10.14 and as low as 8.27, with a median of 9.25.</p><p>These are only a few of the key metrics included in Edgewell Personal Care's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, EPC looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327611/should-value-investors-buy-edgewell-personal-care-epc-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_2-2327611">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.</p><p>Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.</p><p>Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's "Value" category. Stocks with both "A" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.</p><p><b>AES (AES)</b> is a stock many investors are watching right now. AES is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 8.95. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.34. AES's Forward P/E has been as high as 11.23 and as low as 6.60, with a median of 8.84, all within the past year.</p><p>Investors should also note that AES holds a PEG ratio of 1.06. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. AES's industry has an average PEG of 2.08 right now. Over the past 52 weeks, AES's PEG has been as high as 1.39 and as low as 0.72, with a median of 0.95.</p><p>Another notable valuation metric for AES is its P/B ratio of 1.83. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 2.43. Within the past 52 weeks, AES's P/B has been as high as 3.13 and as low as 1.65, with a median of 2.18.</p><p>Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. AES has a P/S ratio of 1.02. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.04.</p><p>Finally, we should also recognize that AES has a P/CF ratio of 6.60. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. AES's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 12.19. AES's P/CF has been as high as 26.42 and as low as 5.95, with a median of 8.37, all within the past year.</p><p>Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that AES is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, AES sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327609/should-value-investors-buy-aes-aes-stock?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_2-2327609">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>The proven Zacks Rank system focuses on earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find winning stocks. Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.</p><p>Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.</p><p>In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's "Value" category. Stocks with "A" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.</p><p>One stock to keep an eye on is <b>Precision Drilling (PDS)</b>. PDS is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 8.40 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 10.95. Over the last 12 months, PDS's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.52 and as low as 4.47, with a median of 8.11.</p><p>Investors should also recognize that PDS has a P/B ratio of 0.86. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. PDS's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.16. PDS's P/B has been as high as 0.98 and as low as 0.64, with a median of 0.81, over the past year.</p><p>Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PDS has a P/S ratio of 0.75. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.31.</p><p>These are just a handful of the figures considered in Precision Drilling's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that PDS is an impressive value stock right now.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327607/is-precision-drilling-pds-stock-undervalued-right-now?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|yseop_template_2-2327607">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Zions Rides on Rates, Loans & Deposits Amid Weak Asset Quality ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:39:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p><strong>Zions Bancorp</strong> ZION remains well-positioned for growth driven by strong loans and deposits, higher interest rates and efforts to boost fee income. However, a mounting expense base and deteriorating asset quality act as headwinds.<br /><br />Zions remains focused on its organic growth strategy. The company&rsquo;s total revenues recorded a CAGR of 2.3% in the last five years (2018-2023). This was primarily driven by robust loan growth, with loans and net leases (net of unearned income and fees) witnessing a 4.4% CAGR in the last four years ended 2023. Decent loan demand, initiatives to boost fee income (majorly capital markets fees) and higher rates will likely aid the company&rsquo;s top-line expansion. As the near-term operating environment remains challenging, we project total revenues (FTE) to decline 2% in 2024. Post that, the metric is expected to rise 3% and 4.9% in 2025 and 2026, respectively.<br /><br />Given the high interest rate regime, Zions&rsquo; net interest margin (NIM) is expected to record a modest expansion, while rising deposit costs will weigh on it. NIM increased to 3.06% in 2022 attributed to higher rates. Though NIM declined in 2023 and the first half of 2024 due to higher funding costs, the metric is expected to improve going forward, given the stabilizing deposit costs, asset yield repricing and high rates. We project NIM to be 2.96%, 3.02% and 3.07% in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.<br /><br />ZION currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). So far this year, shares of the company have gained 11.9% compared with the industry&rsquo;s growth of 8.2%.<br />&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/d8/75549.jpg?v=1266746705" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><p>Zions has been witnessing a consistent rise in expenses. While total non-interest expenses fell in 2020, the metric witnessed a 4.5% CAGR in the last five years (2018-2023). The uptrend persisted in the first six months of 2024 as well. Amid its ongoing investments in franchise and digitizing operations, total expenses are expected to stay elevated. We anticipate adjusted non-interest expenses to increase 3% this year.<br /><br />Also, ZION&rsquo;s deteriorating asset quality poses a concern. A significant rise in provision for credit losses was witnessed in 2022 and 2023. The current tough macroeconomic backdrop will continue to exert pressure on the company&rsquo;s asset quality, keeping the provision level elevated. While we project provision for credit losses to decline in 2024, the metric will likely rise 19.5% in 2025.</p><h2>Bank Stocks Worth a Look</h2><p>Some better-ranked stocks in the banking space are <strong>Northrim BanCorp, Inc. </strong>NRIM and <strong>Sierra Bancorp</strong> BSRR. At present, NRIM carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and BSRR sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here</strong>.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NRIM&rsquo;s current-year earnings has been revised 4.7% upward in the past 30 days. The company&rsquo;s shares have risen 18.6% year to date.<br /><br />The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BSRR&rsquo;s current-year earnings has been revised 12.7% upward in the past two months. Sierra Bancorp&rsquo;s shares have gained 32.3% so far this year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327726/zions-rides-on-rates-loans-deposits-amid-weak-asset-quality?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|zer_report_update-2327726">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ MCK Stock's Uptrend Likely to Continue After Core Ventures Acquisition ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:37:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>McKesson Corporation</strong> MCK, on Monday, inked a definitive agreement to acquire a controlling interest (representing approximately 70% ownership) in Community Oncology Revitalization Enterprise Ventures, LLC (Core Ventures), subject to customary closing conditions. Florida Cancer Specialists &amp; Research Institute, LLC (&ldquo;FCS&rdquo;) physicians will retain a minority interest in Core Ventures.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Core Ventures, a business and administrative services organization, was established by FCS.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Following the completion of the transaction, Core Ventures will be part of the Oncology platform, and financial results will be reported within McKesson&rsquo;s U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. This is expected to strengthen its foothold in the oncology space. The expansion in the lucrative oncology market should support its top-line growth going forward, leading to higher investor interest and driving its share price higher.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Rationale Behind McKesson&rsquo;s Agreement</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Per McKesson, FCS (with more than 250 physicians and 280 advanced practice providers across nearly 100 locations in Florida) will remain independently owned following the close of the transaction. FCS will also join McKesson&rsquo;s The US Oncology Network (The Network), an oncology organization dedicated to advancing local and affordable cancer care and better patient outcomes.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">McKesson&rsquo;s management believes that the agreement is a significant step toward advancing community-based oncology care. Management expects to bring advanced treatments and improved care experiences to patients by growing the company&rsquo;s Oncology platform while reducing the overall cost of care.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">FCS currently conducts clinical trials through the Sarah Cannon Research Institute. By joining The Network, FCS will likely have access to McKesson&rsquo;s differentiated Oncology platform, including best-in-class oncology care products and services.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">FCS&rsquo; management feels that community oncology&#39;s role in increasing access to high-quality, affordable care can be boosted via the power of the combined operational expertise.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Industry Prospects for McKesson</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Per a report by Precedence Research, the global oncology market size accounted for $225.01 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach $668.26 billion by 2034 at a CAGR of 11.5%. Factors like the rising technological advancements in the diagnostics of various cancers and the increasing prevalence of cancer are likely to drive the market.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given the market potential, the latest agreement is expected to provide a significant boost to McKesson&rsquo;s business.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Recent Developments in McKesson&rsquo;s Oncology Unit</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">McKesson announced that Tennessee Cancer Specialists has joined The Network, effective Aug. 1, 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The same month, McKesson reported first-quarter fiscal 2025 results, wherein it registered a solid uptick in its overall revenues, driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. The segment&rsquo;s growth resulted from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers and GLP-1 medications.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In June, McKesson&rsquo;s independent specialty pharmacy specializing in oncology and rare disease areas, Biologics by McKesson, was selected by Accord BioPharma, Inc. as an exclusive specialty pharmacy provider for CAMCEVI (leuprolide) 42mg injection emulsion for subcutaneous use.</p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">McKesson&rsquo;s Share Price Performance</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Shares of the company have gained 29.3% in the past year against the industry&rsquo;s 3.7% decline. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 26.7% growth in the said time frame.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/16/75555.jpg?v=1469840199" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Zacks Rank &amp; Key Picks</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, McKesson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are <strong>DaVita Inc. </strong>DVA, <strong>Quest Diagnostics Incorporated</strong> DGX and <strong>Boston Scientific Corporation </strong>BSX.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">DaVita, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 17.5%. DVA&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 24.2%. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">DaVita&rsquo;s shares have gained 53.9% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 22.5% rise in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quest Diagnostics, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 6.2%. DGX&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 3.3%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Quest Diagnostics has gained 16.2% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 22.5% rise in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Boston Scientific, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.6%. BSX&rsquo;s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 7.2%.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Boston Scientific&rsquo;s shares have rallied 47.7% compared with the industry&rsquo;s 13.9% rise in the past year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327724/mck-stock-s-uptrend-likely-to-continue-after-core-ventures-acquisition?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|company_news_medical_sector-2327724">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About MakeMyTrip (MMYT): Should You Buy? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:30:12 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?</p><p>Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about <b>MakeMyTrip</b> (MMYT).</p><p>MakeMyTrip currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.36, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by seven brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.36 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.</p><p>Of the seven recommendations that derive the current ABR, five are Strong Buy and one is Buy.

<![CDATA[ <p>From a technical perspective, Baxter International (BAX) is looking like an interesting pick, as it just reached a key level of support. BAX recently overtook the 200-day moving average, and this suggests a long-term bullish trend.</p><p>A useful tool for traders and analysts, the 200-day simple moving average helps determine long-term market trends for stocks, commodities, indexes, and other financial instruments. It moves higher or lower in conjunction with longer-term price performance, and serves as a support or resistance level.</p><p>Shares of BAX have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 5.3%. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, suggesting that BAX could be poised for a continued surge.</p><p>Looking at BAX's earnings estimate revisions, investors will be even more convinced of the bullish uptrend. There have been 8 higher compared to none lower for the current fiscal year, and the consensus estimate has moved up as well.</p><p>Investors should think about putting BAX on their watchlist given the ultra-important technical indicator and positive move in earnings estimate revisions.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327570/baxter-international-bax-recently-broke-out-above-the-200-day-moving-average?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|200_day_moving_average_(yseop)-2327570">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Wall Street closed mixed on Monday, weighed down by tech and discretionary stocks. Worries about the upcoming quarterly performance of a semiconductor giant dampened investor mood. Two of the three most widely followed indexes closed the session in the red, while one ended in the green.</span></span></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">How Did the Benchmarks Perform?</span></span></h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 65.44 points, or 0.2%, to close at 41,240.52. Twenty-one components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while nine ended in negative.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite shed 152.03 points, or 0.9%, to close at 17,725.77.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The S&amp;P 500 decreased 17.77 points, or 0.3%, to close at 5,616.84. Five of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the red. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) slid 1.3% and 0.8%, respectively, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) advanced 0.9%.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 1.8% to 16.15. A total of 9.5 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 11.9 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners by a 1.1-to-1 ratio on the S&amp;P 500.</span></span></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">NVIDIA Weighs Down on the Markets</span></span></h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">On Monday, NVIDIA Corporation&rsquo;s NVDA shares dropped 2.3%, bringing down the tech sector with it. While there is some apprehension that anything short of an outstanding outlook from the company&rsquo;s Wednesday quarterly earnings release can bring gloom and doom, Monday&rsquo;s slide, in reality, is a bit of correction before an expected post-earnings boost.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Nvidia is the global market leader in AI chip design and software, controlling around 90% of the market, and its fortunes have a direct impact not only on new-generation tech but AI optimism in general. The market will be looking forward to the company&rsquo;s earnings.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Shares of Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI fell 4.1% and 8.3%, respectively. SMCI currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see <strong>the complete list of today&#39;s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</strong></span></span></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Oil Prices Climb, Driving the Market&rsquo;s Gains</span></span></h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The Libyan government announced the closure of all oil fields on Monday, halting production and exports. This added to supply concerns amid escalating conflict in the Middle East, and oil prices surged. Energy was the biggest winning sector in the session.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Brent crude ended $2.41, or 3.1%, at $81.43/barrel, while WTI crude settled $2.59, or 3.5%, higher at $77.42/barrel.</span></span></p><h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Economic Data</span></span></h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Per the U.S. Census Bureau, durable goods orders for July increased 9.9%. This follows a 6.9% June decrease.</span></span></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327528/stock-market-news-for-aug-27-2024?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-market_news-2327528">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Descartes' Stock Surges 20% YTD: Will the Rally Last? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:17:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Descartes Systems Group Inc.</strong>&rsquo;s DSGX shares have been performing well on the trading front with a 19.6% year-to-date (YTD) gain compared with the S&amp;P 500 composite and sub-industry&rsquo;s growth of 17.8% and 9.2%, respectively. The stock is still down 4% from its 52-week high level of $104.71, reached on Jul 16, 2024.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Based in Canada, Descartes Systems Group provides software-as-a-service logistics solutions to businesses, including transportation and logistics, manufacturing, retail and healthcare. The company benefits from momentum in real-time visibility, global trade intelligence, routing and scheduling solutions and e-commerce business.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In the last reported quarter, Services revenues (contributed 91% to total revenues) amounted to $137.8 million, up 11% year over year. The uptick was primarily attributable to an increase in sales to an expanded customer base of global trade intelligence, routing and transportation management solutions.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/3d/75524.jpg?v=567233211" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Synergies From Acquisitions Bode Well for DGSX</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">DGSX has also been active on the acquisition front. Buyouts have aided growth by expanding product portfolio and adding competence. The company&rsquo;s recent acquisitions include the buyout of Aerospace Software Developments (&ldquo;ASD&rdquo;) in April 2024. Based in Dublin, Ireland, ASD is a software company that builds mission-critical applications based on modern RFID technology, specifically engineered for the Aerospace and Aviation market sectors.<br /><br />In March 2024, the company acquired OCR Services, Inc., specializing in global trade compliance solutions and content. OCR&rsquo;s controlled export data is instrumental in broadening DSGX&rsquo;s vast global trade content library for customers and partners, including SAP and Oracle. Some other notable acquisitions in the recent past are Localz (2023), GroundCloud (2023) and Supply Vision (2023).<br /><br />Synergies arising from the acquisition of OCR and Thyme ASD along with healthy momentum in services revenues, led to 11% year-over-year growth in total revenues in the fiscal first quarter. Also, acquisitions settled in fiscal 2024, including GroundCloud and Localz favorably impacted revenue growth.</p><h2>Estimates Unchanged for DSGX</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 and 2026 revenues is pegged at $634.9 million and $704.6 million, respectively, indicating growth of 10.8% and 11% from the year-ago levels.&nbsp;<br /><br />The estimated figures for fiscal 2025 and 2026 EPS, $1.70 and $2.13, indicate an increase of 26.7% and 25.3%, respectively, from the prior-year actuals.&nbsp;<br /><br />The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 and 2026 EPS has remained unchanged in the past 60 days.</p><h2>Headwinds Persists for DSGX</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Ongoing macroeconomic weakness coupled with forex volatility remain concerns for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.&nbsp;<br /><br />Rising operating costs and integration risks are other headwinds. In the last reported quarter, total operating expenses were $54.6 million, up from $50.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The uptick was due to rising stock-based compensation costs and the partial period of costs from the fiscal 2025 acquisitions.</p><h2>Tech Stocks to Consider</h2><p style="text-align: justify;">Some better-ranked stocks worth consideration in the broader technology space are <strong>Badger Meter </strong>BMI,<strong> Manhattan Associates</strong> MANH and <strong>ANSYS </strong>ANSS. While Badger Meter and Manhattan Associates sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), ANSYS carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) each, at present. You can see<strong> the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Badger Meter&rsquo;s 2024 EPS is pegged at $4.06, up 4.4% in the past 30 days. BMI&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 12.9%. The long-term earnings growth rate is 17.9%. Its shares have risen 23.6% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ANSS&rsquo; 2024 earnings is pegged at $9.72, up 3.7% in the past 30 days. ANSS&rsquo; earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters while missing the mark once, with the average surprise being 4.8%. Its shares have risen 3.6% in the past year.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MANH&rsquo;s 2024 EPS is pegged at $4.26. MANH&rsquo;s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with the average surprise being 26.6%. The stock has surged 34.9% in the past year.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327708/descartes-stock-surges-20-ytd-will-the-rally-last?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-analyst_blog|price_surge_/_plunge-2327708">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue? ]]>
</title>
<pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 13:15:06 +0000</pubDate>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>Have you been paying attention to shares of <b>Leidos (LDOS)</b>? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 1.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $156.2 in the previous session. Leidos has gained 43.1% since the start of the year compared to the 3.3% move for the Zacks Aerospace sector and the -2.2% return for the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry.</p><p><h2>What's Driving the Outperformance?</h2></p><p>The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 30, 2024, Leidos reported EPS of $2.63 versus consensus estimate of $2.26 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.23%.</p><p>For the current fiscal year, Leidos is expected to post earnings of $8.95 per share on $16.27 billion in revenues. This represents a 22.6% change in EPS on a 5.4% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $9.36 per share on $16.94 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 4.57% and 4.1%, respectively.</p><p><h2>Valuation Metrics</h2></p><p>Leidos may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.</p><p>On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.</p><p>Leidos has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.</p><p>In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 20.4X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 11X versus its peer group's average of 15.9X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.38. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.</p><p><h2>Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Leidos currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.</p><p>Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Leidos passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Leidos shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327516/leidos-holdings-inc-ldos-hit-a-52-week-high-can-the-run-continue?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-52_week_high-2327516">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Shares of <b>PulteGroup (PHM)</b> have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 0.5% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $136.47 in the previous session. PulteGroup has gained 29.5% since the start of the year compared to the 19% move for the Zacks Construction sector and the 25.8% return for the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry.</p><p><h2>What's Driving the Outperformance?</h2></p><p>The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 23, 2024, PulteGroup reported EPS of $3.58 versus consensus estimate of $3.21 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.72%.</p><p>For the current fiscal year, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $13.36 per share on $17.43 billion in revenues. This represents a 13.99% change in EPS on an 8.49% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $13.58 per share on $18.35 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 1.65% and 5.29%, respectively.</p><p><h2>Valuation Metrics</h2></p><p>PulteGroup may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.</p><p>On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.</p><p>PulteGroup has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.</p><p>In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 10X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 10X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 10.6X versus its peer group's average of 9.7X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 0.53. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.</p><p><h2>Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, PulteGroup currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.</p><p>Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if PulteGroup meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though PulteGroup shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327515/pultegroup-inc-phm-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-52_week_high-2327515">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Have you been paying attention to shares of <b>Mercury General (MCY)</b>? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $64.53 in the previous session. Mercury General has gained 68.1% since the start of the year compared to the 15.6% move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 26.2% return for the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry.</p><p><h2>What's Driving the Outperformance?</h2></p><p>The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 30, 2024, Mercury General reported EPS of $1.09 versus consensus estimate of $0.8 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 1.88%.</p><p>For the current fiscal year, Mercury General is expected to post earnings of $4 per share on $5.35 billion in revenues. This represents a 1233.33% change in EPS on a 18.13% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6 per share on $5.88 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 50% and 9.82%, respectively.</p><p><h2>Valuation Metrics</h2></p><p>Mercury General may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.</p><p>On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.</p><p>Mercury General has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.</p><p>In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 15.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 13X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 5X versus its peer group's average of 13.6X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.</p><p><h2>Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Mercury General currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.</p><p>Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Mercury General fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Mercury General shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.</p><p><h2>How Does MCY Stack Up to the Competition?</h2></p><p>Shares of MCY have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is <b>Axis Capital Holdings Limited (AXS)</b>. AXS has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of C, and a Momentum Score of B.</p><p>Earnings were strong last quarter. Axis Capital Holdings Limited beat our consensus estimate by 16.27%, and for the current fiscal year, AXS is expected to post earnings of $10.70 per share on revenue of $6.12 billion.</p><p>Shares of Axis Capital Holdings Limited have gained 3.9% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 7.16X and a P/CF of 7.24X.</p><p>The Insurance - Property and Casualty industry is in the top 10% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MCY and AXS, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327517/mercury-general-corporation-mcy-hit-a-52-week-high-can-the-run-continue?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-52_week_high-2327517">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Quantum Increases its Per Share Price With Reverse Stock Split ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Quantum Corporation </strong>QMCO recently announced that it will execute a 1-for-20 reverse stock split strategy to increase the per share trading price of its common stock and adhere to the Nasdaq stock market&#39;s continued listing standards.<br /><br />Under reverse stock split, a company reduces its total number of outstanding shares while proportionally increasing the share price. With this, QMCO&rsquo;s every 20 shares of its common stock will be reclassified into one share. Although the number of shares each investor holds decreases, the value of their total holdings remains unaffected. &nbsp;<br /><br />In cases where the reverse split results in a fractional share, the company ensures rounding it up to the adjacent whole share. QMCO&rsquo;s move is likely to decrease nearly 95,849,938 outstanding shares of its common stock to almost 4,792,497 shares.&nbsp;<br /><br />It will also make proportionate adjustments to its outstanding equity awards, warrants and the maximum number of shares issuable under its equity incentive plans. The exercise or conversion prices for these instruments will be adjusted so that the par value of the common stock remains unchanged. The company&rsquo;s common stock will commence trading on a split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq exchange starting Aug. 27, 2024, with a new CUSIP number of 747906600 under the current ticker &quot;QMCO.&quot;</p><div class="chart_embed"><h3>Quantum Corporation Price and Consensus</h3> <img alt="Quantum Corporation Price and Consensus" height="265" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/charts/d0/1724763234.png" title="" width="572" /> <p>Quantum Corporation price-consensus-chart | Quantum Corporation Quote</p></div><p>For shareholders holding their stock in book entry form or through brokers or other nominees, no action is required, as their positions will be automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. However, shareholders who hold stock certificates will receive instructions from QMCO&rsquo;s transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., on how to collect their new post-split shares.<br /><br />QMCO is a leading provider of end-to-end data management solutions. It offers solutions for capturing, sharing and preserving digital assets over the entire data lifecycle. It caters to leading organizations in life sciences, government, media and entertainment, research and industrial technology verticals. Its premium Myriad and ActiveScale products continue to gain momentum.&nbsp;<br /><br />Nonetheless, soft demand trends across Product, Service and Subscription and Royalty businesses are affecting QMCO&rsquo;s overall performance. In the last reported quarter, its revenues plunged 23% year over year to $71.3 million. Management further highlighted a temporary headwind to gross margins due to a shift in product mix and supply constraints that hurt its results during the quarter. These issues have heightened the current order backlog to above-standard levels.<br /><br />QMCO currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Its shares have lost 64.4% in the past year against the sub-industry&rsquo;s growth of 71.1%.</p><p><img alt="Zacks Investment Research" src="https://staticx-tuner.zacks.com/images/articles/charts/c3/75543.jpg?v=50216192" /><br /><span style="width:100%; display: inline-block; font-size: 8pt;">Image Source: Zacks Investment Research</span></p><h2>Stocks to Consider</h2><p>Some better-ranked stocks from the broader technology space are <strong>Arista Networks, Inc</strong>.

<![CDATA[ Buy 3 Momentum Anomaly Stocks as Markets Rise on Rate Cut Hint ]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[ <p style="text-align: justify;">The broader U.S. equity markets have witnessed a steady uptrend over the past couple of trading sessions, buoyed by strong signals from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about interest rate cuts happening soon. Despite any definite time frame or the quantum of the proposed rate cuts, markets were quick to respond positively and are currently trading in the vicinity of all-time highs. This followed one of the worst performances at the beginning of the month due to a global market sell-off with the unwinding of the yen &ldquo;carry trade&rdquo; as the yen rose in value versus the U.S. dollar.<br /><br />With a better-than-expected 2.8% annualized GDP growth in the second quarter and solid labor market conditions, it appeared that the economy was back on the growth track, cooling recessionary fears. Amid the uncertainty, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks like <strong>H&amp;R Block, Inc.</strong> HRB, <strong>Nova Ltd.</strong> NVMI and <strong>Jackson Financial Inc.</strong> JXN when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.&nbsp;<br /><br />This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, &ldquo;the trend is your friend.&rdquo; At its core, momentum investing is &ldquo;buying high and selling higher.&rdquo; It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. Momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.<br /><br />Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child&rsquo;s play. Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.</p><h2>Screening Parameters for Momentum Anomaly Stocks</h2><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Percentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50:</strong> This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.<br /><br /><strong>Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10:</strong> From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period. This parameter picks the ones that have witnessed a short-term pullback in price.<br /><br /><strong>Zacks Rank #1:</strong> Stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance irrespective of the market conditions. You can see <strong>the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here</strong>.<br /><br /><strong>Momentum&nbsp;</strong><strong>Style Score</strong><strong> of B or Better:</strong> A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors that include volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.<br /><br /><strong>Current Price greater than $5:</strong> The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.<br /><br /><strong>Market Capitalization = Top #3000:</strong> We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure the stability of price.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000:</strong> A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.<br /><br />Here are three stocks out of the four that made it through this screen:<br /><br />Headquartered in Kansas City, MO, <strong>H&amp;R Block</strong> is a leading provider of tax preparation services. The company provides assisted income tax return preparation, do-it-yourself tax solutions and other products and services associated with income tax return preparation in the United States, Canada and Australia. The stock has surged 60.1% in the past year but declined 2.3% in the past week. H&amp;R Block has a Momentum Score of B.&nbsp;<br /><br />Headquartered in Rehovot, Israel, <strong>Nova</strong> designs, develops, produces and sells process control systems used in the manufacture of semiconductors in Israel, Taiwan, the United States, China, Korea and internationally.

<![CDATA[ <p><b>Coinbase Global, Inc.</b> (COIN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.</p><p>Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -12.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Coinbase Global falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?</p><p>Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.</p><p><h2>Earnings Estimate Revisions</h2></p><p>Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.</p><p>Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.</p><p>For the current quarter, Coinbase Global is expected to post earnings of $0.59 per share, indicating a change of +6,000% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -36.9% over the last 30 days.</p><p>For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.68 points to a change of +1,435.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -13.5%.</p><p>For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.52 indicates a change of -55.6% from what Coinbase Global is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -24.8%.</p><p>With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coinbase Global.</p><p>The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:</p><p><h2>12 Month EPS</h2></p><p><h2>Revenue Growth Forecast</h2></p><p>Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.</p><p>For Coinbase Global, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.3 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +93.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $5.74 billion and $5.34 billion estimates indicate +84.8% and -7% changes, respectively.</p><p><h2>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</h2></p><p>Coinbase Global reported revenues of $1.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +104.8%. EPS of $1.07 for the same period compares with -$0.42 a year ago.</p><p>Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.19%. The EPS surprise was 0%.</p><p>Over the last four quarters, Coinbase Global surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.</p><p><h2>Valuation</h2></p><p>No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.</p><p>Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.</p><p>The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.</p><p>Coinbase Global is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.</p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coinbase Global. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327483/coinbase-global-inc-coin-is-a-trending-stock-facts-to-know-before-betting-on-it?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|most_searched_stocks-2327483">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><b>Micron</b> (MU) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.</p><p>Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -8.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, which Micron falls in, has lost 9.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?</p><p>Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.</p><p><h2>Revisions to Earnings Estimates</h2></p><p>Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.</p><p>We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>Micron is expected to post earnings of $1.08 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +200.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.</p><p>The consensus earnings estimate of $1.16 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +126.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.</p><p>For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.32 indicates a change of +703.6% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.</p><p>Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p>The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:</p><p><h2>12 Month EPS</h2></p><p><h2>Projected Revenue Growth</h2></p><p>Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.</p><p>In the case of Micron, the consensus sales estimate of $7.65 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +90.9%. The $24.93 billion and $38.63 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +60.4% and +55%, respectively.</p><p><h2>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</h2></p><p>Micron reported revenues of $6.81 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +81.5%. EPS of $0.62 for the same period compares with -$1.43 a year ago.</p><p>Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.7 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.65%. The EPS surprise was +24%.</p><p>The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.</p><p><h2>Valuation</h2></p><p>No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.</p><p>Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.</p><p>The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.</p><p>Micron is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.

<![CDATA[ <p><b>Amazon</b> (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.</p><p>Shares of this online retailer have returned -4.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has lost 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?</p><p>Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.</p><p><h2>Revisions to Earnings Estimates</h2></p><p>Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.</p><p>Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.</p><p>Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +35.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.5%.</p><p>The consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +63.5%. This estimate has changed +2.9% over the last 30 days.</p><p>For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 indicates a change of +23.2% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.</p><p>With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon.</p><p>The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:</p><p><h2>12 Month EPS</h2></p><p><h2>Projected Revenue Growth</h2></p><p>While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.</p><p>For Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $157.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $634.49 billion and $702.77 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +10.8% changes, respectively.</p><p><h2>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</h2></p><p>Amazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.</p><p>Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.</p><p>The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.</p><p><h2>Valuation</h2></p><p>Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.</p><p>While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.</p><p>As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.</p><p>Amazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.</p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2327488/investors-heavily-search-amazon-com-inc-amzn-here-is-what-you-need-to-know?cid=CS-TRADINGVIEW-FT-tale_of_the_tape|most_searched_stocks-2327488">To read this article on Zacks.com click here.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zacks.com/">Zacks Investment Research</a></p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p><b>e.l.f. Beauty</b> (ELF) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.</p><p>Shares of this cosmetics company have returned -9.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. The Zacks Cosmetics industry, to which e.l.f. Beauty belongs, has lost 7.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?</p><p>Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.</p><p><h2>Earnings Estimate Revisions</h2></p><p>Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.</p><p>Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.</p><p>For the current quarter, e.l.f. Beauty is expected to post earnings of $0.47 per share, indicating a change of -42.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -58.4% over the last 30 days.</p><p>For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.54 points to a change of +11.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.9%.</p><p>For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.48 indicates a change of +26.5% from what e.l.f. Beauty is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.3%.</p><p>Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, e.l.f. Beauty is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p>The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:</p><p><h2>12 Month EPS</h2></p><p><h2>Revenue Growth Forecast</h2></p><p>While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.</p><p>For e.l.f.

For the current and next fiscal years, $1.32 billion and $1.57 billion estimates indicate +29.3% and +18.6% changes, respectively.</p><p><h2>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</h2></p><p>e.l.f.

<![CDATA[ <p><b>Apple</b> (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.</p><p>Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +4.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?</p><p>While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.</p><p><h2>Earnings Estimate Revisions</h2></p><p>Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.</p><p>We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.</p><p>For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share, indicating a change of +8.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.5% over the last 30 days.</p><p>For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.70 points to a change of +9.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.4%.</p><p>For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.</p><p>With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.</p><p>The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:</p><p><h2>12 Month EPS</h2></p><p><h2>Revenue Growth Forecast</h2></p><p>While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues.

<![CDATA[ <p><b>Toyota Motor Corporation</b> (TM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.</p><p>Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -6.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry, which Toyota Motor falls in, has lost 4.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?</p><p>While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.</p><p><h2>Earnings Estimate Revisions</h2></p><p>Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.</p><p>Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.</p><p>For the current quarter, Toyota Motor is expected to post earnings of $4.85 per share, indicating a change of -25.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.</p><p>The consensus earnings estimate of $21.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -14.8%. This estimate has changed -21.4% over the last 30 days.</p><p>For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.33 indicates a change of +8% from what Toyota Motor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.</p><p>Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Toyota Motor is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).</p><p>The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:</p><p><h2>12 Month EPS</h2></p><p><h2>Revenue Growth Forecast</h2></p><p>While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.</p><p>In the case of Toyota Motor, the consensus sales estimate of $79.39 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.3%. The $317.35 billion and $324.12 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.7% and +2.1%, respectively.</p><p><h2>Last Reported Results and Surprise History</h2></p><p>Toyota Motor reported revenues of $75.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.2%. EPS of $6.35 for the same period compares with $7.05 a year ago.</p><p>Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $72.48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.78%. The EPS surprise was +58.35%.</p><p>The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.</p><p><h2>Valuation</h2></p><p>Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.</p><p>Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.</p><p>As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.</p><p>Toyota Motor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.</p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Toyota Motor.

<![CDATA[ <p>Building a successful investment portfolio takes skill and hard work, no matter if you're a growth, value, income, or momentum-focused investor.</p><p>How do you find the right combination of stocks that will generate returns that could fund your retirement, or your kids' college tuition, or your short- and long-term savings goals?</p><p>Enter the Zacks Rank.</p><p><h2>What is the Zacks Rank?</h2></p><p>A unique, proprietary stock-rating model, the Zacks Rank uses earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors create a winning portfolio.</p><p>There are four main factors behind the Zacks Rank: Agreement, Magnitude, Upside, and Surprise.</p><p>Agreement is the extent to which all brokerage analysts are revising their earnings estimates in the same direction. The greater the percentage of analysts revising their estimates higher, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>Magnitude is the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate for the current and next fiscal years.</p><p>Upside is the difference between the most accurate estimate, which is calculated by Zacks, and the consensus estimate.</p><p>Surprise is made up of a company's last few quarters' earnings per share surprises; companies with a positive earnings surprise are more likely to beat expectations in the future.</p><p>These four factors are assigned a raw score that's recalculated every night, which is then compiled into the ranking system. Stocks are classified into five groups using this data, ranging from "Strong Buy" to "Strong Sell."</p><p><h2>The Power of Institutional Investors</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank also allows individual investors, or retail investors, to benefit from the power of institutional investors.</p><p>These professionals manage the trillions of dollars invested in hedge funds, mutual funds, and investment banks, and studies have shown that they can and do move the market because of the large amounts of money they invest with. Thus, the market tends to move in the same direction as institutional investors.</p><p>These investors are known for designing valuation models that focus on earnings and earnings expectations in order to figure out the fair value of a company and its shares. If earnings estimates are raised, it puts a higher value on a company.</p><p>With these changes, institutional investors will act, usually buying stocks with rising estimates and selling those with falling estimates. An increase in earnings expectations can potentially lead to higher stock prices and bigger gains for the investor.</p><p>Since it can often take weeks, if not months, for an institutional investor to build a position (given their size), retail investors who get in at the first sign of upward earnings estimate revisions have a distinct advantage over these larger investors, and can benefit from the expected institutional buying that will follow.</p><p>Not only can the Zacks Rank help you take advantage of trends in earnings estimate revisions, but it can also provide a way to get into stocks that are highly sought after by professionals.</p><p><h2>How to Invest with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank is known for transforming investment portfolios. In fact, a portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 32 years, with an average annual return of +25.41%.</p><p>Moreover, stocks with a new #1 (Strong Buy) ranking have some of the biggest profit potential, while those that fell to a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) have some of the worst.</p><p>Let's take a look at <h2>DaVita HealthCare (DVA)</h2>, which was added to the Zacks Rank #1 list on August 27, 2024.</p><p>Denver, CO-headquartered DaVita Inc. is a leading provider of dialysis services in the U.S. to patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

<![CDATA[ <p>It doesn't matter if you're a growth, value, income, or momentum-focused investor -- building a successful investment portfolio takes skill, research, and a little bit of luck.</p><p>But how do you find the right combination of stocks? Funding your retirement, your kids' college tuition, or your short- and long-term savings goals certainly requires significant returns.</p><p>Enter the Zacks Rank.</p><p><h2>What is the Zacks Rank?</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank, which is a unique, proprietary stock-rating model, employs earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, that makes building a winning portfolio easier.</p><p>There are four main factors behind the Zacks Rank: Agreement, Magnitude, Upside, and Surprise.</p><p>Agreement is the extent to which all brokerage analysts are revising their earnings estimates in the same direction. The greater the percentage of analysts revising their estimates higher, the better chance the stock will outperform.</p><p>Magnitude is the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate for the current and next fiscal years.</p><p>Upside is the difference between the most accurate estimate, which is calculated by Zacks, and the consensus estimate.</p><p>Surprise is made up of a company's last few quarters' earnings per share surprises; companies with a positive earnings surprise are more likely to beat expectations in the future.</p><p>Each one of these factors is given a raw score that's recalculated every night, and then compiled into the Zacks Rank. Using this data, stocks are classified into five groups, ranging from "Strong Buy" to "Strong Sell."</p><p><h2>The Power of Institutional Investors</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank also allows individual investors, or retail investors, to benefit from the power of institutional investors.</p><p>Institutional investors are responsible for managing the trillions of dollars invested in mutual funds, hedge funds, and investment banks. Research has shown that these investors can and do move the market due to the large amount of money they deal with, and thus, the market tends to move in the same direction as them.</p><p>In order to figure out the fair value of a company and its shares, these investors will build valuation models focused on earnings and earnings expectations. Because if you raise estimates for the bottom line, it creates a higher fair value for a company.</p><p>Institutional investors then act on these changes in earnings estimates, typically buying stocks with rising estimates and selling those with falling estimates; an increase in earnings estimates can translate into higher stock prices and bigger gains for the investor.</p><p>Since it can often take weeks, if not months, for an institutional investor to build a position (given their size), retail investors who get in at the first sign of upward earnings estimate revisions have a distinct advantage over these larger investors, and can benefit from the expected institutional buying that will follow.</p><p>Not only can the Zacks Rank help you take advantage of trends in earnings estimate revisions, but it can also provide a way to get into stocks that are highly sought after by professionals.</p><p><h2>How to Invest with the Zacks Rank</h2></p><p>The Zacks Rank is known for transforming investment portfolios. In fact, a portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 32 years, with an average annual return of +25.41%.</p><p>Moreover, stocks with a new #1 (Strong Buy) ranking have some of the biggest profit potential, while those that fell to a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) have some of the worst.</p><p>Let's take a look at <h2>Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB)</h2>, which was added to the Zacks Rank #1 list on August 27, 2024.</p><p>Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation is a provider of locomotives, value-added, technology-based equipment, systems and services to the freight rail and passenger transit industries across the globe.</p><p>Four analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.18 to $7.46 per share. WAB also boasts an average earnings surprise of 11.8%.</p><p>Earnings are forecasted to see growth of 26% for the current fiscal year, and sales are expected to increase 7.4%.</p><p>WAB has been moving higher over the past four weeks as well, up 3.3% compared to the S&P 500's gain of 3%.</p><p><h2>Bottom Line</h2></p><p>With a #1 (Strong Buy) ranking, positive trend in earnings estimate revisions, and strong market momentum, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies should be on investors' shortlist.</p><p>If you want even more information on the Zacks Ranks, or one of our many other investing strategies, check out the Zacks Education home page.</p><p><h2>Discover Today's Top Stocks</h2></p><p>Our private Zacks #1 Rank List, based on our quantitative Zacks Rank stock-rating system, has more than doubled the S&P 500 since 1988. Applying the Zacks Rank in your own trading can boost your investing returns on your very next trade.
